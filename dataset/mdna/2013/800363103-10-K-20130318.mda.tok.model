item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net income for sandy spring bancorp  inc and subsidiaries the company for the year ended december  totaled million per diluted share  compared to net income of million per diluted share for the prior year 
these results reflect the following events net interest income increased in compared to this increase was due primarily to growth in average interest earning assets  largely resulting from higher earning commercial loans added in the acquisition of commercefirst bancorp  inc commercefirst and organic loan growth 
combined with an improved deposit mix  these factors more than offset lower overall earning asset yields 
the provision for loan and lease losses totaled million for compared to million for the increase in the provision for compared to the prior year was due primarily to a decline in historical losses in which caused a credit balance in the provision for the third quarter of  thus reducing the full year provision 
non interest income increased million or for compared to due largely to growth in income from mortgage banking activities due to a higher volume of refinancing activity 
total loans at december  increased compared to the balance at december  this improvement was driven primarily by the growth in loans mentioned above 
in  the mid atlantic region in which the company operates continued to show slow but steady economic improvement 
concerns over a struggling national economy and possible large federal government spending cuts and tax increases the fiscal cliff at year end continued to impede both the regional and national economic outlook 
while the housing markets have improved  this sector is still significantly below levels experienced in prior economic recoveries 
the positive trends in housing and consumer spending have been offset by a contraction in manufacturing and stubbornly high unemployment which have caused uncertainty on the part of both large and small businesses which has limited economic expansion 
the financial stability of the european union continues to be an underlying volatility factor 
together with state and municipal budget challenges across the country  these factors have caused enough economic uncertainty  particularly among individual consumers and small and medium sized businesses  to suppress confidence and thus constrain the pace of economic expansion and lending 
despite this challenging business environment  the company has emphasized the fundamentals of community banking as it has maintained strong levels of liquidity and capital while overall credit quality has continued to improve 
the net interest margin increased to in compared to for during  the growth in average interest earning assets and noninterest bearing deposits largely offset a decline in the average rates earned on interest earning assets 
average total deposits increased  compared to the prior year  while average loans increased compared to liquidity remained strong due to the borrowing lines with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve and the size and composition of the investment portfolio 
the company s credit quality continued to improve as non performing assets decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was due primarily to a combination of the company s continuing efforts at resolution of non performing loans and reduced migration of existing loans into nonperforming status  particularly in the commercial real estate portfolio 
non performing assets represented of total assets at december  compared to at december  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases was 
for  compared to 
for the prior year 
at december   the bank remained above all well capitalized regulatory requirement levels 
in addition  tangible book value per common share increased to from at december  total assets at december  increased compared to december  loan balances increased compared to the prior year end due primarily to increases of in residential mortgage and construction loans and in commercial loans  which were somewhat offset by a decrease in consumer loans 
the increase in commercial loans was due to organic loan growth during the year and the commercefirst acquisition during the second quarter of customer funding sources  which include deposits plus other short term borrowings from core customers  increased compared to balances at december   again due largely to the commercefirst acquisition 
the increase in customer funding sources was driven primarily by a combined increase of in interest bearing and noninterest bearing checking accounts and an increase of in regular savings accounts 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decline in certificates of deposit 
the company continued to manage its net interest margin  primarily by reducing rates on certificates of deposit during this extended period of historically low interest rates 
during the same period  stockholders equity increased to million due to stock issued in connection with the commercefirst acquisition and net income in net interest income increased by million  or compared to the prior year 
the effects of a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  growth of in average noninterest bearing deposits  growth in average interest earning assets and a decrease in non performing assets more than offset a decline of basis points in the yield on average interest earning assets 
non interest income increased in compared to income from mortgage banking activities increased due to higher volumes and increased average gains from refinancing activity in the current year 
in addition  other non interest income increased over the prior year due to higher gains on asset dispositions and vendor incentives 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decrease of in service charges on deposits due to lower overdraft fees 
non interest expenses increased in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher salaries and benefits expenses  outside data services costs and professional fees primarily resulting from the commercefirst acquisition 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in fdic insurance expense due primarily to improved financial ratios compared to critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements may reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently rely to a greater extent on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such may have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value 
a decline in the value of assets required to be recorded at fair value will warrant an impairment write down or valuation allowance to be established 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when readily available 
management believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results allowance for loan and lease losses  goodwill impairment  accounting for income taxes  fair value measurements  including assessment of other than temporary impairment  defined benefit pension plan 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on the basic principle that a loss be accrued when it is probable that the loss has occurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management believes that the allowance is adequate 
however  its determination requires significant judgment  and estimates of probable losses in the lending portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses  future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the loans and leases comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  resulting from changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by the company periodically review the loan and lease portfolio and the allowance 
such reviews may result in additional provisions based on their judgments of information available at the time of each examination 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses has two basic components a general allowance reflecting historical losses by loan category  as adjusted by several factors whose effects are not reflected in historical loss ratios  and specific allowances for individually identified loans 
each of these components  and the allowance methodology used to establish them  are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the amount of the allowance is reviewed monthly by the credit and investment risk committee of the board of directors and formally approved quarterly by that same committee of the board 
general allowances are based upon historical loss experience by portfolio segment measured over the prior eight quarters and weighted so that losses realized in the most recent quarters have the greatest effect 
the historical loss experience is supplemented to address various risk characteristics of the company s loan portfolio including trends in delinquencies and other non performing loans  changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio  changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio  concentrations of loans to specific industry segments  changes in economic conditions on both a local and national level  changes in the company s credit administration and loan portfolio management processes  and quality of the company s credit risk identification processes 
the general allowance comprised of the total allowance at december  and at december  the general allowance is calculated in two parts based on an internal risk classification of loans within each portfolio segment 
allowances on loans considered to be criticized and classified under regulatory guidance are calculated separately from loans considered to be pass rated under the same guidance 
this segregation allows the company to monitor the allowance applicable to higher risk loans separate from the remainder of the portfolio in order to better manage risk and ensure the sufficiency of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the portion of the allowance representing specific allowances is established on individually impaired loans 
as a practical expedient  for collateral dependent loans  the company measures impairment based on the net realizable value of the underlying collateral 
for loans on which the company has not elected to use a practical expedient to measure impairment  the company will measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
in determining the cash flows to be included in the discount calculation the company considers the following factors that combine to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  demonstrated or documented support available from financial guarantors  and the adequacy of collateral value and the ultimate realization of that value at liquidation 
at december   the specific allowance accounted for of the total allowance as compared to at december  the estimated losses on impaired loans can differ substantially from actual losses 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the company s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets  including goodwill 
the company s reporting units were identified based upon an analysis of each of its individual operating segments 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is required 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value  an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill as of october of each year using september data and again at any quarter end if any triggering events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to  a significant deterioration in future operating results  adverse action by a regulator or a loss of key personnel 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the company to use a degree of subjectivity 
under current accounting guidance  the company has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
based on the assessment of these qualitative factors  if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than the carrying value  then performing the two step impairment process  previously required  is unnecessary 
however  if it is determined that the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step  described above  of the two step process must be performed 
the company has elected this accounting guidance with respect to its community banking and investment management segments 
at september  there was no evidence of impairment of goodwill or intangibles in any of the company s reporting units 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
other intangible assets have finite lives and are reviewed for impairment annually 
these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis over varying periods that initially did not exceed years 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws 
if actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized  there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods 
the company s accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the company recognized  when applicable  interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non interest expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management s analysis of tax regulations and interpretations 
significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements 
management expects that the company s adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs 
factors that could impact management s judgment include changes in income  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning strategies 
fair value measurements the company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities available for sale  residential mortgages held for sale and commercial loan interest rate swap agreements 
loans where it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms are considered impaired loans and are measured on a nonrecurring basis 
the company conducts a quarterly review for all investment securities that have potential impairment to determine whether unrealized losses are other than temporary 
valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  valuations are based on pricing models  quotes for similar investment securities  and  where necessary  an income valuation approach based on the present value of expected cash flows 
in addition  the company considers the financial condition of the issuer  the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms and the intent and ability of the company to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the above accounting policies with respect to fair value are discussed in further detail in note fair value to the consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plan the company has a qualified  noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan 
the plan was frozen for existing entrants after december  and all benefit accruals for employees were frozen as of december  based on past service 
future salary increases and additional years of service will no longer affect the defined benefit provided by the plan although additional vesting may continue to occur 
several factors affect the net periodic benefit cost of the plan  including the size and characteristics of the plan population  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions 
pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plan and other factors including salary  age  years of employment  and the terms of the plan 
as a result of the plan freeze  the characteristics of the plan population should not have a materially different effect in future years 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  which is december of each year 
the discount rate is adjusted each year on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a number of factors that include expectations of market performance and the target asset allocation adopted in the plan investment policy 
should actual asset returns deviate from the projected returns  this can affect the benefit plan expense recognized in the financial statements

net interest income the largest source of the company s operating revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for purposes of this discussion and analysis  the interest earned on tax exempt investment securities has been adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes 
the result is referred to as tax equivalent interest income and tax equivalent net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income should be considered in conjunction with the review of the information provided in the preceding table

interest income vs 
the company total tax equivalent interest income increased for compared to the prior year 
the previous table shows that  in  the increase in average loans and leases more than offset a continued decline in earning asset yields with respect to the loan portfolio which resulted in an increase in total tax equivalent interest income 
in  the average balance of the loan portfolio  including residential mortgage loans held for sale  increased compared to the prior year 
this growth was primarily in the owner occupied and investor real estate  commercial business and residential construction and mortgage portfolios 
these increases were driven by loans added from the commercefirst acquisition in the second quarter of and organic loan growth as the regional economy slowly improved 
the yield on average loans and leases decreased by basis points due to the continued prevailing low interest rate environment as relatively higher rate loans were paid off and new loans were originated at comparatively lower rates 
the decline in the portfolio yield was driven primarily by a combined decrease of basis points in the yield in the residential mortgage portfolio together with a decrease of basis points in the yield in the overall commercial loan portfolio 
the decrease in the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio was due to declining rates on both new and existing adjustable rate mortgage loans  which the company does not sell but maintains in the portfolio 
the average yield on total investment securities decreased basis points while the average balance of the portfolio decreased or million in compared to the decline in investments was necessary to fund growth in the loan portfolio and the commercefirst acquisition in the second quarter of the decrease in the yield on investments was due primarily to calls of securities that were replaced by lower yielding investments as a result of lower overall market rates 
vs 
interest income decreased by million or in compared to due primarily to a decline in earning asset yields with respect to both the loan and investment portfolios and  to some extent  a decrease in average loans and leases 
the yield on average loans and leases decreased by basis points due to the continued prevailing low interest rate environment as relatively higher rate loans were paid off and new loans were originated at comparatively lower rates 
in addition  the average balance of the loan portfolio declined in compared to the prior year as the volume of quality loan demand remained low due to the struggling economy 
the decline in the portfolio yield was driven by decreases in all three of the major portfolio segments 
the decrease in the average balance of the loan portfolio was driven mainly by declines in commercial business loans  due to soft market demand  and consumer loans  due to pay downs of conventional second mortgage loans and installment loans 
the average yield on investment securities decreased basis points while the average balance of the portfolio increased or million in compared to the prior year 
the growth in investments was due to liquidity provided primarily by the decline in loan balances while the decrease in the yield on investments was due to the fact that a significant portion of the portfolio was invested in amortizing securities that were replaced by lower yielding investments as a result of lower overall market rates 
interest expense vs 
interest expense decreased by million or in compared to  primarily as a result of a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
deposit activity during was driven by the commercefirst acquisition and by clients emphasis on safety and liquidity as average total deposits increased for the year compared to the prior year 
this increase was driven by increases of million or in average noninterest bearing and interest bearing checking accounts together with an increase of million or in regular savings accounts as clients kept funds in short term instruments to preserve liquidity 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in average certificates of deposit of million or in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the rates offered on certificates in an effort to preserve the company s net interest margin during this extended period of historically low interest rates 
this largely offset the growth in certificates of deposit from the commercefirst acquisition 
in addition  the average rate paid on advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta decreased basis points for compared to due primarily to the restructuring of million of such advances into longer term lower rate instruments during the fourth quarter of average balances of money market accounts increased in compared as clients maintained liquidity as mentioned above 
vs 
interest expense decreased by million or in compared to  primarily as a result of a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  which decreased to from 
deposit activity during continued to be affected by a very slowly recovering economy and historically low interest rates 
average deposits remained virtually level as average certificates of deposit decreased million or compared to the prior year 
this decrease was offset by an increase of million or in average noninterest bearing and interest bearing checking accounts as clients redeployed funds into short term instruments to preserve liquidity 
average balances of money market accounts remained level during compared to the prior year 
during  the company continued to preserve its net interest margin in the face of reduced loan volumes as it reduced rates on higher cost certificates of deposit thus prompting growth in noninterest bearing checking accounts 
much of this decrease  particularly in time deposits  was incurred with single product clients  and thus did not significantly affect clients with multiple product relationships 
interest rate performance vs 
the company s net interest margin increased to for compared to in while the net interest spread increased to in compared to in the increase in the net interest margin was due primarily to the combination of increased average loan balances  lower rates on money market and time deposits and higher balances of noninterest bearing deposits 
vs 
the declining trend in the net interest margin narrowed to a decrease of only basis points in compared to  as the net interest spread remained even in compared to these two indicators of interest rate performance reflected a decline of basis points in both the yield on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

total non interest income was million for compared to million for as shown in the table above  the primary drivers of non interest income for were increases in income from mortgage banking activities and other non interest income 
income from mortgage banking activities increased in compared to due primarily to higher loan origination volumes and higher average gains on sales  due to both increased refinancing activity and steadily declining rates during the period 
in addition  other non interest income increased compared to the prior year due mainly to higher gains from asset dispositions and other fees 
wealth management income is comprised of income from trust and estate services  investment management fees earned by west financial services  the company s investment management subsidiary and fees on sales on investment products and services 
during  wealth management income increased compared to the prior year 
trust services fees increased compared to the prior year period  due to an increase in assets under management and other one time fees 
investment management fees in west financial services increased for compared to  also due to higher assets under management 
fees on sales of investment products and services decreased for the year as assets under management declined 
overall total assets under management increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december income from visa check fees increased for compared to the prior year due to a higher volume of electronic transactions while service charges on deposits decreased in compared to due primarily to a decline in overdraft fees

vs 
total non interest income was million in compared to million in as shown in the table above  the primary drivers of the decrease in non interest income for compared to were decreases in service charges on deposits resulting from lower overdraft fees due to legislation and insurance agency commissions due primarily to a change in the timing of the recognition of renewal premiums that was implemented in these decreases were largely offset by increases in wealth management revenues due to higher assets under management as a result of market activity and the addition of new clients 
visa check fees increased due to higher volumes of electronic transactions

non interest expenses totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of 
this growth in expenses was due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits expenses  outside data services costs and professional fees  largely as a result of merger expenses incurred in conjunction with the commercefirst acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other real estate owned expenses due to a lower volume of sales of such properties and a reduction in fdic expenses due primarily to a regulatory change in the calculation of such premiums that was effective with the second quarter of salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expenses  increased in due primarily to higher compensation expenses as a result of the commercefirst acquisition and due to merit increases and higher health benefits costs 
the average number of full time equivalent employees remained relatively constant in compared to outside data services expenses increased in compared to the prior year due primarily to software expenses related to the company s merger with commercefirst 
occupancy expenses increased for compared to due to higher rental expenses due to a larger branch network 
this expense was somewhat offset by lower grounds maintenance and utilities expenses as a result of unseasonably mild weather during much of equipment expenses increased in over the prior year due to higher depreciation and software expenses

other real estate owned expenses decreased in compared to as the company opted in to liquidate a number of other real estate owned properties in order to reduce non performing assets 
other non interest expenses increased in compared to due mainly to an increase in the company s reserve for recourse with respect to sales of mortgage loans 
vs 
non interest expenses totaled million in compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expenses  increased in due primarily to higher compensation expenses as a result of specific targeted staff additions  merit increases and higher incentive compensation expenses related to organic growth in specific product offerings compared to the prior year 
the number of average full time equivalent employees remained relatively constant from to fdic insurance expense decreased in compared to due to a regulatory change in the calculation of such premiums that was effective with the second quarter of professional fees declined in the current year as the company completed the staffing of its internal audit function which had previously been outsourced 
other real estate owned expenses increased in compared to due to losses on sales of other real estate owned as the company made a concerted effort to dispose of such nonperforming assets 
other non interest expenses increased compared to due mainly to higher personnel recruiting expenses and increased state franchise taxes 
operating expense performance management views the gaap efficiency ratio as an important financial measure of expense performance and cost management 
the ratio expresses the level of non interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue net interest income plus total non interest income 
lower ratios indicate improved productivity 
non gaap financial measures the company also uses a traditional efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes that its traditional ratio better focuses attention on the operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing non interest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental  and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
the reader is cautioned that the non gaap efficiency ratio used by the company may not be comparable to gaap or non gaap efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 
in general  the efficiency ratio is non interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income 
non interest expenses used in the calculation of the non gaap efficiency ratio exclude goodwill impairment losses  the amortization of intangibles  and non recurring expenses 
income for the non gaap ratio includes the favorable effect of tax exempt income  and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  and non recurring gains 
the measure is different from the gaap efficiency ratio  which also is presented in this report 
the gaap measure is calculated using non interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
the gaap and non gaap efficiency ratios are reconciled and provided in the following table 
the non gaap efficiency ratio decreased in compared to the prior year due primarily to an increase in net interest income  and to a lesser extent  an increase in non interest income 
the gaap efficiency ratio decreased in compared to due to the impact of higher net interest income and non interest income which offset an increase in non interest expenses driven by merger expenses from the commercefirst acquisition 
in addition  the company uses pre tax pre provision pre merger expense income as a measure of the level of recurring income before taxes 
management believes this provides financial statement users with a useful metric of the run rate of revenues and expenses which is readily comparable to other financial institutions 
this measure is calculated by adding subtracting the provision credit for loan and lease losses  the provision for income taxes and merger expenses back to net income 
this metric increased in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher net interest income

the residential real estate portfolio  which is comprised of residential construction and permanent residential mortgage loans  reflected a increase at december  compared to december  permanent residential mortgages  most of which are family  increased due to higher loan origination volumes of adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the company generally retains such adjustable rate mortgages in its portfolio and sells the fixed rate mortgages that it originates in the secondary mortgage market 
residential construction loans increased at december  compared to the balance at december  due to increased construction activity as a result of mild weather conditions and low interest rates 
the commercial loan portfolio increased by million to billion at december  compared to the prior year end largely due to the commercefirst acquisition 
the increase in commercial loans was due to a increase in commercial business loans  a increase in commercial investor real estate loans and a increase in commercial owner occupied real estate loans at december  compared to december  commercial adc loans decreased at december  compared to december  as the company reduced its exposure to this segment of the portfolio 
excluding the effect of the commercefirst acquisition  the commercial loan portfolio increased or million due primarily to increases of in commercial investor real estate loans and in commercial business loans 
the consumer loan portfolio remained virtually level at million at december  compared to december  equity lines of credit increased in this increase was offset by declines in installment loans and conventional second mortgage loans due to weak consumer demand as a result of the state of the regional and national economy

the outstanding balance of no single issuer  except for us government agency securities  exceeded ten percent of stockholders equity at december   or during  the decrease in the investment portfolio was due primarily to maturities and calls of securities  the proceeds of which were used to fund the organic growth in the loan portfolio 
the decrease in available for sale securities was due largely to calls mentioned above while the increase in held to maturity securities was due primarily to a change in management s internal guidelines with respect to the composition of the portfolio 
the investment portfolio consists primarily of us agency securities  us agency mortgage backed securities  us agency collateralized mortgage obligations and state and municipal securities 
the duration of the portfolio was years at december  and years at december  the company considers the duration of the portfolio to be adequate for liquidity purposes 
this investment strategy has resulted in a portfolio with low credit risk that would provide the required liquidity needed to meet increased loan demand 
the portfolio is monitored on a continuing basis with consideration given to interest rate trends and the structure of the yield curve and with constant assessment of economic projections and analysis 
at december   the trust preferred portfolio included one pooled trust preferred security backed by debt issued by banks and thrifts  which totaled million  with a fair value of million 
the fair value of this security was determined by a third party valuation specialist due to the limited trading activity for this security in the marketplace 
the specialist used an income valuation approach technique present value that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs 
the methodology  observable inputs and significant assumptions employed by the specialist to determine fair value are provided in note investment securities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of this valuation  it was determined that the pooled trust preferred security had incurred credit related otti of million  which was recognized in earnings for the twelve months ended december  cumulative credit related otti of million has been recognized in earnings through december  non credit related otti on this security  which is not expected to be sold and which the company has the ability to hold until maturity  was million at december  this non credit related otti was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income oci at december  maturities and weighted average yields for investment securities available for sale and held to maturity at december  are presented in the following table

excluding the deposits added through the commercefirst acquisition  total deposits increased 
increases in noninterest bearing and interest bearing checking accounts together with regular savings accounts were the primary drivers of the overall deposit portfolio increase compared to the prior year 
the activity in these deposit products can be attributed primarily to clients emphasis on safety and liquidity considering the current extended period of low interest rates and the volatility of alternative investments 
certificates of deposit decreased compared to the prior year end  as the company managed its deposit mix to improve its net interest margin 
excluding the certificates added from the commercefirst acquisition  certificates decreased 
prior to the acquisition  commercefirst had relied on brokered deposits to fund its loan growth 
these deposits are being replaced by organic deposit growth as they reach maturity 
total borrowings decreased at december  compared to december  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction of million in short term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
such borrowings have been utilized primarily to temporarily fund  at very low interest rates  increases in loans late in the fourth quarter of and capital management management monitors historical and projected earnings  dividends and asset growth  as well as risks associated with the various types of on and off balance sheet assets and liabilities  in order to determine appropriate capital levels 
during  total stockholders equity increased million to million at december   from million at december  this increase was due primarily to stock issued in conjunction with the commercefirst acquisition and net income during the period 
the ratio of average equity to average assets was for  as compared to for bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain capital ratios in accordance with guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulators 
these guidelines are commonly known as risk based capital guidelines 
the actual regulatory ratios and required ratios for capital adequacy  in addition to the ratios required to be categorized as well capitalized  are summarized for the company in the following table 
risk based capital ratios minimum ratios at december  regulatory requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage tier capital of million and total qualifying capital of million each included million in trust preferred securities that are considered regulatory capital for purposes of determining the company s tier capital ratio 
as of december   the most recent notification from the bank s primary regulator categorized the bank as a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action rules of the federal deposit insurance act 
designation as a well capitalized institution under these regulations is not a recommendation or endorsement of the company or the bank by federal bank regulators 
in june  the federal reserve  fdic and occ issued three joint notices of proposed rulemaking nprs to address the implementation of the proposed basel iii regulatory capital framework for us financial institutions  including proposed minimum capital requirements  definitions of qualifying capital instruments  and risk weighted asset calculations 
as proposed  it appears that the company s risk weighted assets may increase primarily due to changes in the ranges of risk weightings for residential mortgages and home equity loans 
however  the effect of this change may be offset by revised definitions of qualifying capital instruments 
the company has analyzed the possible effect of the proposed nprs and currently estimates that our risk based capital ratios will exceed the proposed requirements on a fully phased in basis 
the regulatory agencies have asked financial institutions to comment on the nprs and are expected to review the feedback and draft final rules  which could take some time to complete 
as a result  the final rules may differ from the current nprs  which currently provide for an extended phase in over several years 
the company will continue to analyze the proposed nprs as changes are communicated by the regulatory agencies 
tangible common equity tangible equity  tangible assets and tangible book value per share are non gaap financial measures calculated using gaap amounts 
tangible common equity and tangible assets exclude the balances of goodwill and other intangible assets from stockholder s equity and total assets  respectively 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure provides information to investors that may useful in understanding our financial condition 
because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible equity and tangible assets  this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies

the company s loan and lease portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risks  which are inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
the company s credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  which limits exposure to any single customer  industry or collateral type 
typically  each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit losses based on historical loss experience 
home mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience 
loans secured by personal property  such as auto loans  generally experience medium credit losses 
unsecured loan products  such as personal revolving credit  have the highest credit loss experience and for that reason  the company has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending 
credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly  as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
generally  improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers  enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements 
improvements  if any  in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times 
inconsistent economic conditions may have an adverse affect on the operating results of commercial customers  reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations 
current economic data has shown that while the mid atlantic region is one of the stronger markets in the nation  the company is continuing to deal with the lingering impact of a very slowly recovering economy and its resulting effects on the company s borrowers  particularly in the real estate sector 
total non performing loans decreased to million or at december  compared to the balance at december  while the diversification of the lending portfolio among different commercial  residential and consumer product lines along with different market conditions of the dc suburbs  northern virginia and baltimore metropolitan area has mitigated some of the risks in the portfolio  local economic conditions and levels of non performing loans may continue to be influenced by the current slow and uneven economic recovery on both a regional and national level 
to control and manage credit risk  management has a credit process in place to reasonably ensure credit standards are maintained along with an in house loan administration accompanied by oversight and review procedures 
the primary purpose of loan underwriting is the evaluation of specific lending risks and involves the analysis of the borrower s ability to service the debt as well as the assessment of the value of the underlying collateral 
oversight and review procedures include the monitoring of portfolio credit quality  early identification of potential problem credits and the aggressive management of problem credits 
as part of the oversight and review process  the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance 
the allowance represents an estimation of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined through careful and ongoing evaluation of the credit portfolio  and involves consideration of a number of factors  as outlined below  to establish an adequate allowance for loan losses 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  which may be susceptible to significant change 
loans and leases deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance  while recoveries are credited to the allowance 
management adjusts the level of the allowance through the provision for loan and lease losses  which is recorded as a current period operating expense 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes a general allowance that reflects historical losses  as adjusted  by credit category  and a specific allowance for impaired credits on an individual or portfolio basis 
this methodology is further described in the section entitled critical accounting policies and in note significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the allowance is reviewed monthly and approved quarterly by the credit and investment risk committee of the board of directors 
the company recognizes a collateral dependent lending relationship as non performing when either the loan becomes days delinquent or as a result of factors such as bankruptcy  interruption of cash flows  etc 
considered at the monthly credit committee meeting 
when a commercial loan is placed on non accrual status  it is considered to be impaired and all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed 
classification as an impaired loan is based on a determination that the company may not collect all principal and interest payments according to contractual terms 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as leases  residential real estate and consumer loans 
typically  all payments received on non accrual loans are applied to the remaining principal balance of the loans 
integral to the assessment of the allowance process is an evaluation that is performed to determine whether a specific allowance on an impaired loan is warranted and  when losses are confirmed  a charge off is taken to reduce the loan to its net realizable value 
any further collateral deterioration results in either further specific allowances being established or additional charge offs 
at such time an action plan is agreed upon for the particular loan and an appraisal will be ordered depending on the time elapsed since the prior appraisal  the loan balance and or the result of the internal evaluation 
a current appraisal on large loans is usually obtained if the appraisal on file is more than months old and there has been a material change in market conditions  zoning  physical use or the adequacy of the collateral based on an internal evaluation 
the company s policy is to strictly adhere to regulatory appraisal standards 
if an appraisal is ordered  no more than a day turnaround is requested from the appraiser  who is selected by credit administration from an approved appraiser list 
after receipt of the updated appraisal  the assigned credit officer will recommend to the chief credit officer whether a specific allowance or a charge off should be taken 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve a specific allowance or charge off between monthly credit committee meetings to insure that there are no significant time lapses during this process 
the company s methodology for evaluating whether a loan is impaired begins with risk rating credits on an individual basis and includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition  payment record and available cash resources that may include the sufficiency of collateral value and  in a select few cases  verifiable support from financial guarantors 
in measuring impairment  the company looks primarily to the discounted cash flows of the project itself or to the value of the collateral as the primary sources of repayment of the loan 
the company may consider the existence of guarantees and the financial strength and wherewithal of the guarantors involved in any loan relationship 
guarantees may be considered as a source of repayment based on the guarantor s financial condition and respective payment capacity 
accordingly  absent a verifiable payment capacity  a guarantee alone would not be sufficient to avoid classifying the loan as impaired 
management has established a credit process that dictates that structured procedures be performed to monitor these loans between the receipt of an original appraisal and the updated appraisal 
these procedures include the following an internal evaluation is updated quarterly to include borrower financial statements and or cash flow projections 
the borrower may be contacted for a meeting to discuss an updated or revised action plan which may include a request for additional collateral 
re verification of the documentation supporting the company s position with respect to the collateral securing the loan 
at the monthly credit committee meeting the loan may be downgraded and a specific allowance may be decided upon in advance of the receipt of the appraisal 
upon receipt of the updated appraisal or based on an updated internal financial evaluation the loan balance is compared to the appraisal and a specific allowance is decided upon for the particular loan  typically for the amount of the difference between the appraisal and the loan balance 
the company will specifically reserve for or charge off the excess of the loan amount over the amount of the appraisal 
in certain cases the company may establish a larger reserve due to knowledge of current market conditions or the existence of an offer for the collateral that will facilitate a more timely resolution of the loan 
if an updated appraisal is received subsequent to the preliminary determination of a specific allowance or partial charge off  and it is less than the initial appraisal used in the initial charge off  an additional specific allowance or charge off is taken on the related credit 
partially charged off loans are not written back up based on updated appraisals and always remain on non accrual with any and all subsequent payments applied to the remaining balance of the loan as principal reductions 
no interest income is recognized on loans that have been partially charged off 
loans that have their terms restructured eg  interest rates  loan maturity date  payment and amortization period  etc 
in circumstances that provide payment relief or other concessions  to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are considered troubled debt restructured loans tdr s 
all restructurings that constitute concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are considered impaired loans and may either be in accruing status or non accruing status 
non accruing restructured loans may return to accruing status provided there is a sufficient period of payment performance in accordance with the restructure terms 
loans may be removed from disclosure as an impaired loan in the year subsequent to the restructuring if their revised loans terms are considered to be consistent with terms that can be obtained in the credit market for loans with comparable risk 
the company may extend the maturity of a performing or current loan that may have some inherent weakness associated with the loan 
however  the company generally follows a policy of not extending maturities on non performing loans under existing terms 
maturity date extensions only occur under revised terms that clearly place the company in a position to increase the likelihood of or assure full collection of the loan under the contractual terms and or terms at the time of the extension that may eliminate or mitigate the inherent weakness in the loan 
these terms may incorporate  but are not limited to additional assignment of collateral  significant balance curtailments liquidations and assignments of additional project cash flows 
guarantees may be a consideration in the extension of loan maturities 
as a general matter  the company does not view extension of a loan to be a satisfactory approach to resolving non performing credits 
on an exception basis  certain performing loans that have displayed some inherent weakness in the underlying collateral values  an inability to comply with certain loan covenants which are not affecting the performance of the credit or other identified weakness may be extended 
collateral values or estimates of discounted cash flows inclusive of any potential cash flow from guarantees are evaluated to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses 
the actual occurrence and severity of losses involving impaired credits can differ substantially from estimates 
the determination of the allowance requires significant judgment  and estimates of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the credits comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as may result from changes in economic conditions 
in addition  federal and state regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by the bank  periodically review the loan and lease portfolio and the allowance 
such reviews may result in adjustments to the allowance based upon their analysis of the information available at the time of each examination 
the company makes provisions for loan and lease losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level  as established by use of the allowance methodology discussed above 
the provision for loan and lease losses was million in compared to million in and million in historical net charge offs represent a principal component in the application of the company s allowance methodology 
a continued decrease in the confirmed losses over the related historical period in addition to a decline in problem loans  served to reduce the overall provision for the primary reason for the increase in the provision in compared to was the leveling off of the historical charge offs and problem loans during this period 
substantially all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans originated by the company are sold in the secondary mortgage market 
concurrent with such sales  the company is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated 
the related sale agreements grant the purchasers recourse back to the company  which could require the company to repurchase loans or to share in any losses incurred by the purchasers 
this recourse exposure typically extends for a period of six to eighteen months after the sale of the loan although the time frame for repurchase requests can extend for an indefinite period 
such transactions could be due to a number of causes including borrower fraud or early payment default 
the company has seen a very limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers for such events and routinely monitors its exposure in this regard 
the company maintains a liability of million for possible losses due to repurchases 
given its lack of history as to losses of this type  the company believes that this reserve is adequate 
allowance for loan and lease losses the following table presents a five year history for the allocation of the allowance for loan and leases losses 
the allowance is allocated in the following table to various loan and lease categories based on the methodology used to estimate loan losses  however  the allocation does not restrict the usage of the allowance for any specific loan or lease category

variations can occur over time in the estimation of the adequacy of the allowance as a result of the credit performance of borrowers 
no portion of the allowance was unallocated at december  or december  at december   total non performing loans and leases were million  or of total loans and leases  compared to million  or of total loans and leases  at december  timely recognition and aggressive management of problem credits has resulted in the significant reduction of the migration of these loans into non accrual status during this period 
the allowance represented of non performing loans and leases at december  as compared to at december  the increase in this ratio was due primarily to the decline in non performing loans and leases mentioned above 
the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of total loans and leases was at december  as compared to at december  this decrease was due to a combination of a lower level of both non performing loans and historical losses at december  compared to the prior year 
in addition  under current purchase accounting rules  the loans added to the portfolio as a result of the commercefirst acquisition were adjusted to their fair value and thus did not include a related allowance for loan and lease losses 
continued analysis of the actual loss history on the problem credits in and provided an indication that the coverage of the inherent losses on the problem credits was adequate 
the company continues to monitor the impact of the economic conditions on our commercial customers  the reduced inflow of non accruals  lower inflow in criticized loans and the significant decline in early stage delinquencies 
the improvement in these credit metrics supports management s outlook for continued improved credit quality performance 
the balance of impaired loans was million  with specific allowances of million against those loans at december   as compared to million with allowances of million  at december the company borrowers are concentrated in six counties in maryland  three counties in virginia and in washington dc commercial and residential mortgages  including home equity loans and lines  represented of total loans and leases at december  compared to at december  certain loan terms may create concentrations of credit risk and increase the company s exposure to loss 
these include terms that permit the deferral of principal payments or payments that are smaller than normal interest accruals negative amortization  loans with high loan to value ratios  loans  such as option adjustable rate mortgages  that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments that are in excess of increases that would result solely from increases in market interest rates  and interest only loans 
the company does not make loans that provide for negative amortization or option adjustable rate mortgages

market risk management the company net income is largely dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or re price on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or re price more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or re price more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest earning assets that are funded by interest bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
the company s interest rate risk management goals are to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets  and to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of interest earning assets 
management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing  within policy limits  the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched  by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits  and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis 
the company s board of directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy  which is administered by management s asset liability management committee alco 
the policy establishes limits on risk  which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income a measure of net interest income at risk and the fair value of equity capital a measure of economic value of equity or eve at risk resulting from a hypothetical change in us treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years 
the company measures the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short term earnings  long term value  and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling 
the simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the company 
when interest rates change  actual movements in different categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  loan prepayments  and withdrawals of time and other deposits  may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model 
finally  the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan customers ability to service their debts  or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan  lease  and deposit products 
the company prepares a current base case and eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter and reports the analysis to the board of directors 
in addition  more frequent forecasts are produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate 
the statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk 
average interest rates are shocked by    and basis points bp  although the company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment 
it is management s goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels 
the company augments its quarterly interest rate shock analysis with alternative external interest rate scenarios on a monthly basis 
these alternative interest rate scenarios may include non parallel rate ramps and non parallel yield curve twists 
if a measure of risk produced by the alternative simulations of the entire balance sheet violates policy guidelines  alco is required to develop a plan to restore the measure of risk to a level that complies with policy limits within two quarters 
measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution s short term performance in alternative rate environments 
these measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period  usually one year 
they do not necessarily indicate the long term prospects or economic value of the institution 
estimated changes in net interest income change in interest rates bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp policy limit december  n a n a n a n a december  n a n a n a n a as shown above  measures of net interest income at risk improved from december  at all rising interest rate shock levels 
all measures remained well within prescribed policy limits 
the primary contributor to the improved risk position with respect to net interest income was the payoff of million in overnight borrowings early in the first quarter of loans acquired in the commercefirst acquisition resulted in an increase in the balance of short term loans included in the loan portfolio which results in higher interest income as rates are shocked up 
the measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the company s cash flows  and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities 
the difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity  which  in theory  approximates the fair value of the company s net assets 
estimated changes in economic value of equity eve change in interest rates bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp policy limit december  n a n a n a n a december  n a n a n a n a measures of the economic value of equity eve at risk improved compared to year end in all rising interest rate shock levels 
the positive impact on eve is caused by longer durations in demand accounts and money market accounts together with the restructuring of million in fhlb advances which generates more benefit as market rates increase in the shock scenarios 
the increased level of noninterest bearing deposits resulting from the commercefirst acquisition also contributed to an increase in the market value of deposits and thus increasing the eve 
liquidity management liquidity is measured by a financial institution ability to raise funds through loan and lease repayments  maturing investments  deposit growth  borrowed funds  capital and the sale of highly marketable assets such as investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the company liquidity position  considering both internal and external sources available  exceeded anticipated short term and long term needs at december  management considers core deposits  defined to include all deposits other than time deposits of thousand or more  to be a relatively stable funding source 
core deposits equaled of total interest earning assets at december  in addition  loan and lease payments  maturities  calls and pay downs of securities  deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements 
in assessing liquidity  management considers operating requirements  the seasonality of deposit flows  investment  loan and deposit maturities and calls  expected funding of loans and deposit withdrawals  and the market values of available for sale investments  so that sufficient funds are available on short notice to meet obligations as they arise and to ensure that the company is able to pursue new business opportunities 
liquidity is measured using an approach designed to take into account  in addition to factors already discussed above  the company s growth and mortgage banking activities 
also considered are changes in the liquidity of the investment portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 
under this approach  implemented by the funds management subcommittee of alco under formal policy guidelines  the company s liquidity position is measured weekly  looking forward at thirty day intervals from thirty to three hundred sixty days 
the measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position  along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth 
resulting projections as of december   show short term investments exceeding short term borrowings by million over the subsequent days 
this projected excess of liquidity versus requirements provides the company with flexibility in how it funds loans and other earning assets 
the company also has external sources of funds  which can be drawn upon when required
