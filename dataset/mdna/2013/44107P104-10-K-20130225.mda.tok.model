environmental and regulatory matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances 
these laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of hazardous or toxic materials  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials 
environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated  and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures 
in connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels  we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities 
although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us  we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future 
operational agreements all of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements  with some of those hotels also subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operation under the designated brand 
under these agreements  the managers generally have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day to day operation of the hotels  including establishing room rates  securing and processing reservations  procuring inventories  supplies and services  providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels 
the managers provide all managerial and other employees for the hotels  review the operation and maintenance of the hotels  prepare reports  budgets and projections  and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels 
these support services include planning and policy services  divisional financial services  product planning and development  employee staffing and training  corporate executive management and certain in house legal services 
we have certain approval rights over budgets  capital expenditures  significant leases and contractual commitments  and various other matters 
general terms and provisions agreements governing the management and operation of our hotels typically include the terms described below term and fees for operational services 
the initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is to years  with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager 
the majority of our management agreements condition the manager s right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria 
the manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee  which is calculated as a percentage generally of annual gross revenues  and an incentive management fee  which typically is calculated as a percentage generally of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel 
in the case of our starwood managed hotels  the base management fee only is of annual gross revenues  but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to starwood under a separate license agreement as described below 
license services 
in the case of our starwood managed hotels  the operation of the hotels is subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand  including rights to use trademarks  service marks and logos  matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies  and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services 
although the term of these license agreements with starwood generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating 
table of contents agreements  the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement 
as noted above  the starwood licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees generally of gross revenues attributable to room sales and of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales  which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of of gross revenues received by starwood under the operating agreements 
chain or system programs and services 
managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis 
such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services  regional or other centralized management and administrative services  marketing and sales programs and services  training and other personnel services  and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized  regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis 
costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services 
working capital and fixed asset supplies 
we are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies for example  linen  china  glassware  silver and uniforms 
we also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels 
for certain hotels  the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis  with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements 
furniture  fixtures and equipment replacements 
we are required to provide the managers with all furniture  fixtures and equipment ff e necessary for the operation of the hotels including funding any required ff e replacements 
on an annual basis  the managers prepare budgets for ff e to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds  which budgets are subject to our review and approval 
for purposes of funding such expenditures  a specified percentage typically of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name  to which the manager has access 
in the case of our starwood managed hotels  our operating agreements contemplate that this reserve account also may be used to fund the cost of certain major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building as described below 
for certain of our marriott managed hotels  we have entered into an agreement with marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account  rather than funds being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each hotel  with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly below the amount that would otherwise have been maintained in such separate hotel reserve accounts 
for certain of our starwood managed hotels  the periodic reserve fund contributions  which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers for each hotel  are distributed to us and  as to this pool of hotels  we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels 
building alterations  improvements and renewals 
the managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs  alterations  improvements  renewals and replacements to the structural  mechanical  electrical  heating  ventilating  air conditioning  plumbing and elevators of each hotel  along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required  in the manager s reasonable judgment  to keep the hotel in a competitive  efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards 
we generally have approval rights as to such budgets and expenditures  which we review and approve based on our manager s recommendations and on our judgment 
expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners  although as noted above our agreements with starwood contemplate that certain such expenditures may be funded from the reserve account 

table of contents treatment of additional owner funding 
as additional owner funding becomes necessary either for expenditures generally funded from the ff e replacement funds  or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners  most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers 
one approach frequently utilized at our marriott managed hotels is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid  with interest  from operational revenues  with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees 
another approach typically that is used at our starwood managed hotels  as well as with certain expenditures projects at our marriott managed hotels  is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel  resulting in an increase to owner s priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees 
for our starwood managed hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above  the amount of any additional reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis  determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year 
territorial protections 
certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning  operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area 
the area restrictions vary with each hotel  from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multi mile radius from the hotel in other areas 
sale of the hotel 
subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels see below under special termination rights  we generally are limited in our ability to sell  lease or otherwise transfer the hotels by the requirement that the transferee assume the related management agreements and meet specified other conditions  including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager 
performance termination rights 
in addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager  most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights by us to terminate management or operating agreements on the basis of the manager s failure to meet certain performance based metrics  typically including a specified threshold return on owner s investment in the hotel  along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified revpar performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market 
typically  such performance based termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve specified performance thresholds over a consecutive two year period  and are subject to the manager s ability to cure and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts or  in some instances  waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees 
we have agreed in the past  and may agree in the future  to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates  which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements 
special termination rights 
in addition to any performance based or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements  we have negotiated with marriott and starwood specific termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements 
while the brand affiliation of a property may increase the value of a hotel  the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement or even brand affiliation also can increase the value for prospective purchasers 
these termination rights can take a number of different forms  including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement  termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation  as well as termination without sale or other condition  which may require payment of a fee 
these termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period  impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by ebitda  require that a certain number of properties continue to maintain the brand affiliation  or be restricted to a specific pool of assets 

table of contents employees as of december   we had employees  of which work in the united states 
we had employees located in our offices in london  rio de janeiro  amsterdam and singapore 
none of host s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  other than those working in our office in rio de janeiro 
these employee numbers do not include the hotel employees of our new zealand and australian properties  which also are host employees  as they are under the direct supervision and control of our third party hotel managers 
our third party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels 
although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels  we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force  particularly those hotels with unionized labor 
we believe relations with these employees are positive

item a 
risk factors the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully 
in addition  these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 
table of contents financial risks and risks of operation our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry 
the lodging industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers  both of which are affected by the strength of the economy  as well as other factors 
changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers may create difficulties for the industry over the long term and adversely affect our results 
during the recession in and  overall travel was reduced  which had a significant effect on our results of operations 
while operating results have improved since then  uncertainty in the strength and direction of the recovery and continued high unemployment have slowed the pace of the overall economic recovery 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy 
our results of operations and any forecast we make  may be affected by  and can change based on  a variety of circumstances that affect the lodging industry  including changes in the international  national  regional and local economic climate  changes in business and leisure travel patterns  the effect of terrorist attacks and terror alerts in the united states and internationally  as well as other geopolitical disturbances  supply growth in markets where we own hotels  which may adversely affect demand at our properties  the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels  the performance of the managers of our hotels  outbreaks of disease and the impact on travel of natural disasters and weather  physical damage to our hotels as a result of earthquakes  hurricanes  or other natural disasters  or the income lost as a result of the damage  changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors  and unionization of the labor force at our hotels 
a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital  impact our long term business strategy  and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements 
in addition  the continuing debate in congress regarding the national debt ceiling  federal budget deficit concerns  and overall weakness in the economy resulted in actual and threatened downgrades of us government securities by the various major credit ratings agencies  including standard poor s and fitch ratings 
all of these factors have created uncertainty in us and global financial markets  which factors could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world 
this in turn could  directly or indirectly  adversely affect lodging demand and therefore our business and financial condition 
because of the unprecedented nature of these events  including the negative credit rating actions with respect to us government securities  the ultimate impact on global markets and our business  financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent 
also  in standard poor s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on france  italy and seven other european countries  which has impacted negatively global markets and economic conditions 
the continued uncertainty over the outcome of the governments and other european union eu member states financial support programs and the possibility that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles could further disrupt global markets and economic growth in these countries 
we have properties in several eu member states  held through our european joint venture  that have experienced difficulties servicing their sovereign debt  including italy and spain  and the results of operations at those hotels also could be affected adversely by any adverse economic conditions in these countries 

table of contents disruptions in the financial markets may affect adversely our business and results of operations  our ability to obtain financing on reasonable and acceptable terms  and our ability to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
the united states and global equity and credit markets have at times experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions since  all of which caused market prices of the stock of many companies to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances impacted liquidity in the financial markets  which made terms for financings less attractive  and  in some cases  resulted in the lack of availability of certain types of financing 
continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may impact negatively our ability to access additional short term and long term financing on reasonable terms or at all  which would impact negatively our liquidity and financial condition 
a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may impact negatively our ability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
disruptions in the financial markets also may adversely affect our credit rating 
while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity with which to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  if our operating results weaken significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate  or if interest rates increase significantly  we could face liquidity problems that could affect materially and adversely our results of operations and financial condition 
economic conditions may affect adversely the value of our hotels which may result in impairment charges on our properties 
we analyze our assets for impairment in several situations  including when a property has current or projected losses from operations  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or when other material trends  contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred  such that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property s carrying value over its fair value 
we may incur additional impairment charges in the future  which charges will affect negatively our results of operations 
we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized would not be material to our results of operations 
for information on impairment charges taken in and  see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
we depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary 
unlike regular c corporations  host inc must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income other than net capital gain in order to qualify as a reit  including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash 
funds used by host inc to make required distributions are provided through distributions from host lp our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including credit market conditions as discussed above  unfavorable market perception of our growth potential  decreases in our current and estimated future earnings  or decreases in the market price of the common stock of host inc our ability to access additional capital also may be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness which  under certain circumstances  restrict our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and host lp distributions 
the occurrence of any of these factors  individually or in combination  could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth 
we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt 
as of december   we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately billion 
our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments  which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts  dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs 
additionally  our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  
table of contents limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us  if at all  or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions 
if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness  we will have to raise additional funds through sales of host lp s op units or host inc s common stock  the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host lp  or the sale of our assets 
we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or  if available  will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan 
under certain circumstances  we would be required to use the cash from some of the events described above to repay other indebtedness 
the terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks 
the documents governing the terms of our existing senior notes and our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
these covenants restrict  among other things  our ability to conduct acquisitions  mergers or consolidations  unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness  incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics  create liens securing indebtedness  unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens  sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness  make distributions without satisfying certain financial metrics  and conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arm s length basis and  in certain instances  without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions 
certain of these covenants under our senior notes  including restrictions on incurring debt and making distributions  are no longer in effect while our senior notes maintain their current investment grade rating 
however  we are still subject to similar covenants under the terms of our credit facility 
in addition  certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial performance tests 
the restrictive covenants in the applicable indenture s  the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt 
in addition  certain of our mortgage debt requires that  to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels  we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels 
in some cases  the lender may apply the escrowed amount to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt 
if such provisions are triggered  the amounts required to be escrowed may affect negatively our liquidity by 
table of contents limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties 
for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness  see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
our ability to pay dividends and to make distributions may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness or preferred units 
we are  and may in the future become  party to agreements and instruments that restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on classes and series of host inc capital stock and host lp s payment of distributions on its classes of units 
under the terms of host lp s credit facility  distributions to host lp unitholders  including host inc  upon which host inc 
depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends  are permitted only to the extent that host lp can satisfy certain financial covenant tests concerning leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage and meet other requirements 
we will also be subject to similar restrictions under the terms of our senior notes if our senior notes are no longer rated investment grade 
we are permitted under our credit facility and senior notes indenture to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host inc s reit status 
under the terms of host lp s outstanding preferred op units  we are not permitted to make distributions on our common op units unless all cumulative distributions have been paid or funds for payment have been set aside for payment on our preferred op units 
in the event that we fail to pay the accrued distributions on our preferred op units for any reason  including any restriction on making such distributions under the terms of our debt instruments as discussed above  distributions will continue to accrue on such preferred op units and we will be prohibited from making any distributions on our common op units until all such accrued but unpaid distributions on our preferred op units have been paid or funds for such payment have been set aside 
an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets 
interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility  the mortgages on nine properties and the fixed to floating interest rate swaps linked to two other properties are based on floating rates 
as a result  an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes  including investments in our portfolio 
further  rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced 
we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate hedging contracts 
currently  all of the mortgages with floating rates  which are secured by nine of our hotel properties  are fully or partially hedged through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps and floors 
while these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates  they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets  thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy 
rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital 
our senior notes are rated by moody s investors service  standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings 
these independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes at any time 
such downgrades may affect negatively our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital 
our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases 
many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels  such as debt service payments  property taxes  insurance  utilities  and employee wages and benefits  are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels 
our expenses also will be affected by inflationary increases  and certain costs  such as wages  benefits and insurance  may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period 
in the event of a significant decrease in demand  our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits 
our managers also may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates 
any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties 

table of contents our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business  liquidity  financial position and or results of operations 
as part of our business strategy  we seek to acquire primarily luxury and upper upscale hotel properties 
we may acquire properties through various structures  including transactions involving portfolios  single assets  joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities 
we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods  including proceeds from host inc equity offerings  issuance of limited partnership interests of host lp  advances under our credit facility  the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sales of assets 
continued disruptions in credit markets may limit our ability to finance acquisitions and may limit the ability of purchasers to finance hotels and affect adversely our disposition strategy and our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance acquisitions 
we may  from time to time  be in the process of identifying  analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions 
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions 
our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms  or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  liquidity  financial position and or results of operations  including as a result of our forfeiture of deposits in connection with our failure to consummate an acquisition or our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 
we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels 
we currently are  and in the future may be  involved in the development of hotel properties  timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties  including the development of retail  office or apartments  including through joint ventures 
there are risks inherent in any new development  including we may not obtain the zoning  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development 
a delay in receiving these approvals could affect the returns we expect to receive 
any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs 
defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defect 
we may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development  creating default risks 
the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential  fractional or interval ownership  increases in mortgage rates and or decreases in mortgage availability  market absorption or oversupply  with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshares for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate 
in addition  to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures that involve shared control  this creates additional risks  including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or could have or develop business interests  policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours 
see we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts 
any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners ability to complete the developments on schedule and along the scope that currently is contemplated  or to achieve the intended value of these projects 
for these reasons  there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by the company from these transactions or any future similar transactions 

table of contents we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels 
we have entered into management agreements with third party managers to operate our hotel properties 
the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name 
while we monitor the hotel managers performance  we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately 
in addition  from time to time  we have had  and continue to have  differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements 
we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations 
however  if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations  we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third party dispute resolution 
failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could affect adversely our results of operations 
our hotel managers or their affiliates manage  and in some cases own  have invested in  or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels  all of which may result in conflicts of interest 
as a result  our hotel managers have in the past made  and may in the future make  decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest 
we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel  particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor 
our third party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels 
although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels other than employing  but not managing  the associates at our new zealand and australian properties  we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force  particularly those hotels with unionized labor 
from time to time  hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes  lockouts  public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity 
we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our third party managers and their labor force or other events 
the resolution of labor disputes or re negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs  a significant component of our costs  either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs 
we do not have the ability to affect the outcome of these negotiations 
our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations 
the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments 
we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures 
in addition  we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels  to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance  particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels  such as ballrooms  meeting space and restaurants 
these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays 
in addition  because we depend on external sources of capital  we may not have the necessary funds to invest and  if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers  the manager may terminate the management agreement 
moreover  we may not necessarily realize a significant  or any  improvement in the performance of the hotels in which we make these investments 
the ownership of hotels outside the united states and the expansion of our business into new markets outside of the united states will expose us to risks relating to owning hotels in those international markets 
part of our business strategy is to expand our presence outside of the united states 
as of december   we own directly hotels located outside of the united states 
we also are party to a joint venture that owns hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns one hotel in australia and a non controlling interest in two hotels 
table of contents currently open and five hotels in development in india 
we may have difficulty managing our expansion into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy  an absence of business relationships in the area  or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations 
there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states  which include employment laws and practices  tax laws  which may provide for income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated  directly or indirectly  are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions  compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy  the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability  cost and terms of such financing  adverse changes in local  political  economic and market conditions  insurance coverage related to terrorist events  changes in interest rates and or currency exchange rates  regulations regarding the incurrence of debt  and difficulties in complying with us rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states 
any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international country expansion 
if we do not effectively manage this expansion and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts 
we have made investments in joint ventures in europe and asia and are exploring further investment opportunities in asia  europe and latin america 
we may  from time to time  invest as a co venturer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing hotel properties directly 
investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved  including the possibility that partners or co venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions 
co venturers often share control over the operation of a joint venture 
actions by a co venturer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances our co venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our  or the joint venture s  interests or goals  or our co venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests  or contrary to our policies or objectives 
although generally we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture in order to permit our objectives to be achieved  we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners 
disputes between us and partners or co venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers from focusing their time and effort on our business 
our management agreements could affect the sale or financing of our hotels 
under the terms of our management agreements  we generally may not sell  lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions 
our ability to finance or sell our properties  depending upon the structure of such transactions  may require the manager s consent 
if the manager does not consent to such sale or financing  we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest 

table of contents we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts  and federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future 
we obtain terrorism insurance as part of our all risk property insurance program  as well as our general liability and directors and officers coverage 
however  our all risk policies have limitations  such as per occurrence limits  annual aggregate coverage limits and sublimits  all of which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios 
also  all risk insurers only are required to provide terrorism coverage to the extent mandated by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra 
property damage related to war and to nuclear  radiological  biological and chemical incidents is excluded under our policies 
while tripra will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear  radiological  biological and chemical perils  tripra does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and  to date  insurers are not willing to provide this coverage  even with government reinsurance 
we have a wholly owned captive insurance company through which we obtain a policy for nuclear  biological  chemical and radiological nbcr coverage 
this captive insurer has the same ability as other insurance companies to apply to the us treasury for reimbursement  as provided for in tripra  and is subject to the same deductibles and co insurance obligations 
this potential reimbursement applies to property insurance only  and not to general liability or directors and officers insurance  and there are no assurances that we will be able to recover any or all of our nbcr losses under this program 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we  or our hotel managers  carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability  property  business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties 
these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties 
generally  our all risk property policies provide coverage that is available on a per occurrence basis and that  for each occurrence  has an overall limit  as well as various sub limits  on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive 
sub limits exist for certain types of claims  such as service interruption  debris removal  expediting costs  landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes  and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits 
the dollar amounts of these sub limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit 
in this regard  hotels in certain of our markets  including california  florida and new zealand  have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters 
recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income 
there is no assurance that this insurance  where maintained  will fully fund the re building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake  hurricane  or other natural disaster  or the income lost as a result of the damage 
our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and  in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage  any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the manager s program for the same purpose 
therefore  if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels  or  in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager  affects hotels owned by others  the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub limits  depending on the type of claim  have been reached 
each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available 
we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and  as a result  we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  or certain types of terrorism 
in addition  there are other risks  such as certain environmental hazards  that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage 
we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy 
should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur  or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier  we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

table of contents litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have accrued a potential litigation loss of approximately million in connection with a lawsuit in the th judicial district court of bexar county  texas involving the sale of land encumbered by a ground lease for the san antonio marriott rivercenter 
see part i item legal proceedings for more information on the verdict and the status of the appeal 
we also are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business and are vigorously defending these claims  however  no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings 
we believe  based on currently available information  that the results of such proceedings  in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but might be material to our operating results for any particular period  depending  in part  upon the operating results for such period 
we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels  individuals or companies who use our hotels  our investors  our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance 
we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to hotels or businesses we acquire 
assets and entities that we have acquired  or may in the future acquire  may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse  or only limited recourse  against the sellers 
in general  the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and seek recourse against our sellers 
while usually we require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive  such indemnification often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds  a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses 
as a result  there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties 
the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations  plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects  all of which may affect adversely our revenues  expenses  operating results and financial condition 
finally  indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us 
while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations  materiality thresholds  deductibles or caps on losses  there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers 
we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance 
exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results 
as a result of the expansion of our international operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position 
we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro  the canadian dollar  the mexican peso  the australian dollar  the new zealand dollar  the british pound sterling  the polish zloty  the brazilian real and the chilean peso 
in  revenues in these currencies represented approximately of our total revenues 
although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies  these transactions  if entered into  will not eliminate that risk entirely 
to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars  if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies  the conversion of such amounts into us dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our revenues or earnings 

table of contents applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities 
as a reit  host inc is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn  assets it can own and activities in which it can engage 
business activities that could be impacted by applicable reit laws include  but are not limited to  activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate  including the development and or sale of timeshare or condominium units 
due to these restrictions  we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities  including those mentioned above  in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal  state  local  and  if applicable  foreign taxation on their taxable income 
we may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are inherently illiquid 
real estate properties generally cannot be sold quickly and  accordingly  we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could affect adversely our financial condition and the ability to service our debt 
in addition  under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits  we may be limited in our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets 
our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels located on the leased properties 
as of december   of our hotels are subject to third party ground leases encumbering all or a portion of the hotel 
these ground leases generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments  which are often based on economic indicators such as the consumer price index 
our ability to pay ground rent could be affected adversely to the extent that our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases 
in addition  if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease  the buyer would be required to assume the ground lease  which may result in a lower sales price 
environmental problems are possible and can be costly 
we believe that our properties comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws 
unidentified environmental liabilities could arise  however  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property 
the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage  and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination  each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances 
these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials 
compliance with other government regulations can be costly 
our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation  including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada  building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety 
under the ada  all 
table of contents public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons 
these laws and regulations may be changed from time to time  or new regulations adopted  resulting in additional costs of compliance  including potential litigation 
for example  the ada was revised substantially in september and our facilities were required to comply with the new regulations by march  a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance  imposition of fines or an award of attorneys fees to private litigants 
compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures 
any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations  including the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anti corruption laws  but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with  or be able to detect violations of  any such laws or regulations 
in addition  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
risks of ownership of host inc s common stock there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc common stock and changes in control 
host inc s charter and bylaws  the partnership agreement of host lp  and the maryland general corporation law the mgcl contain a number of provisions  the exercise or existence of which could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for host inc s stockholders or host lp s unitholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following restrictions on transfer and ownership of host inc s stock 
to maintain host inc s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of host inc s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals  which  as defined in the code  may include certain entities 
in addition  if host inc  or one or more owners of or more of host inc  actually or constructively owns or more of a tenant of host inc or a tenant of any partnership in which host inc is a partner  the rent received by host inc either directly or through any such partnership from such tenant generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit income qualification tests of the code  and therefore could jeopardize host inc s qualification as a reit  unless the tenant qualifies as a trs and certain other requirements are met 
accordingly  host inc s charter prohibits ownership  directly or by attribution  by any person or persons acting as a group  of more than in value or number  whichever is more restrictive  of shares of host inc s outstanding common stock  preferred stock or any other class or series of stock  each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary  and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon  to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale 
a transfer of shares of host inc s stock to a person who  as a result of the transfer  violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances  and  in any event  would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of host inc s stock in excess of the ownership limit 
these restrictions will not apply if host inc s board of directors determines that it is no longer in host inc s best interests to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership is no longer required for host inc to qualify as a reit 
removal of board of directors 
host inc s charter provides that  except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock  directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two thirds of all 
table of contents the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors 
vacancies on host inc s board of directors may be filled  at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose  by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors  except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of directors 
any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors 
preferred shares  classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval 
host inc s charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that host inc has authority to issue is  consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock 
host inc s board of directors has the authority  without a vote of stockholders  to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock  and to establish the terms  preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to dividends and other distributions  qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series 
because host inc s board of directors has this power  it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms  preferences  powers and rights  including voting rights  senior to the rights of holders of existing stock 
certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of host inc certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring host inc  including business combination provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of the corporation s then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who  at any time within the two year period immediately prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder  and thereafter imposes two super majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of a corporation defined as voting shares of stock that  if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer  would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares 
host inc is subject to the maryland business combination statute 
our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the mgcl 
there can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 
additionally  title  subtitle of the mgcl permits our board of directors  without stockholder approval and regardless of what currently is provided in our charter or bylaws  to implement certain takeover defenses  such as a classified board  some of which we do not have 
merger  consolidation  share exchange and transfer of host inc s assets 
under maryland law and host inc s charter  subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock  we can merge with or into another entity  consolidate with one or more other entities  participate in a share exchange or transfer host inc s assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved by host inc s board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl  and by host inc s stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  except that any merger of host inc with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host inc s form of organization from a corporation to a trust 
table of contents requires only the approval of host inc s stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger 
under the mgcl  specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity 
host inc s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
certain charter and bylaw amendments 
host inc s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host inc s stock  fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter  removal of directors  the filling of vacancies  exculpation and indemnification of directors  calling special stockholder meetings and others  all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host inc s stockholders holding two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
as permitted under the mgcl  host inc s charter and bylaws provide that the board of directors has the exclusive right to amend host inc s bylaws 
these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host inc s charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc common stock  without the approval of the board of directors 
shares of host inc s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host inc s common stock 
we may issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions  fund capital expenditures  refinance debt or for other corporate purposes 
sales of a substantial number of shares of host inc s common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host inc s common stock 
in addition  holders of op units who redeem their units and receive  at host inc s election  shares of host inc 
common stock will be able to sell those shares freely 
as of december   there are approximately million op units outstanding owned by third parties that are redeemable  which represents approximately of all outstanding units 
further  a substantial number of shares of host inc s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans 
we maintain two stock based compensation plans i the comprehensive stock plan  whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted shares of common stock  options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock  and ii an employee stock purchase plan 
at december   there were approximately million shares of host inc s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan and million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
also as of december   host lp had outstanding million principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures that could become exchangeable  under certain conditions  for shares of host inc s common stock 
although the exchange conditions currently have not been satisfied  these debentures would be exchangeable for approximately million shares based on the current exchange prices 
for million of such exchangeable debentures  however  host inc has the option to issue cash  shares of host inc s common stock or any combination thereof in settlement of the debentures  should they be presented for exchange 
on april   host inc entered into two sales financing agreements  one with each of bny mellon capital markets  llc and scotia capital usa inc  through which host inc 
may issue and sell  from time to time  shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
the sales will be made in at the market offerings under sec rules  including sales made directly on the new york stock exchange 
each of bny mellon capital markets  llc and scotia capital usa inc is acting as sales agent 
host inc 
may sell shares of common stock under its program  from time to time  based on market conditions  although it is not under an obligation to sell any shares 
as of december   approximately million of host inc s common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the program 
shares of host inc s common stock  having an aggregate offering price of approximately million  remain issuable from time to time under the agreements 
any additional shares of common stock issued by host inc  whether issued under this program or otherwise  would be available in the future for sale in the public markets 

table of contents our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host inc s common stock 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions  whether from operations  sales  acquisitions  development or refinancings  and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  shares of host inc s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes  rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may impact negatively the market price of host inc s common stock 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host inc s common stock 
market interest rates may affect the price of shares of host inc s common stock 
we believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the dividend rate on the shares  considered as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher dividend rate 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of host inc s common stock to decrease 
federal income tax risks to qualify as a reit  each of host inc and its subsidiary reits are required to distribute at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gain  regardless of available cash or outstanding obligations 
to continue to qualify as a reit  host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gain 
to the extent that host inc satisfies this distribution requirement  but distributes less than of its taxable income and net capital gain for the taxable year  it will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income and net capital gain 
in addition  host inc will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions made by host inc with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of of its ordinary income  of its net capital gain  and any undistributed taxable income from prior years  less excess distributions from prior years 
host inc intends to make distributions  subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants  to its stockholders in order to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the imposition of a significant nondeductible excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from host lp and its subsidiaries 
there are differences in timing between host inc s recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for distribution due to  among other things  the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom taxable income  which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow 
due to transactions entered into in years prior to host inc s conversion to a reit  host inc could recognize substantial amounts of phantom taxable income in the future 
it is possible that any differences between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of the related cash could require us to borrow funds or for host inc to issue additional equity in order to enable host inc to meet its distribution requirements and  therefore  to maintain its reit status and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax 
in addition  because the reit distribution requirements prevent host inc from retaining earnings  generally we will be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity 
it is possible that any of these sources of funds  if available at all  would not be sufficient to meet host inc s distribution and tax obligations 
host lp owns of the outstanding common stock and a portion of the outstanding preferred stock of two entities that have elected to be treated as reits 
each of these subsidiary reits are subject to the same requirements that host inc must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit  including the distribution requirements described above 
adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits fail to qualify as a reit 
we believe that host inc has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the code  commencing with its taxable year beginning january   and host inc currently intends to 
table of contents continue to operate as a reit during future years 
in addition  host inc owns  through host lp  two entities that have elected to be treated as reits 
as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited  no assurance can be provided that host inc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that each of host inc s subsidiary reits qualify as a reit 
if any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit  it is possible that host inc would fail to qualify as a reit unless it or the subsidiary reit could avail itself of certain relief provisions 
new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entity s qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification 
if host inc or any of the subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit  and any available relief provisions did not apply  the non qualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income  and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to statutory relief  the non qualifying reit would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost 
any determination that host inc or one of its subsidiary reits does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could materially reduce the value of host inc s common stock 
the additional tax liability of host inc 
or the subsidiary reit for the year  or years  in which the relevant entity did not qualify as a reit would reduce its net earnings available for investment  debt service or distributions to stockholders 
furthermore  the non qualifying entity no longer would be required to make distributions to stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of its distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits 
this means that  if host inc were to fail to qualify as a reit  host inc s stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on those dividends at capital gain rates and host inc s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends  subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code 
host inc s failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host lp s credit facility  which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder  which  in turn  would constitute an event of default under host lp s outstanding debt securities 
if our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes  each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  host inc must satisfy two gross income tests  pursuant to which specified percentages of its gross income must be passive income  such as rent 
for the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with our trs  which rental income currently constitutes substantially all of host inc s and each of our subsidiary reits gross income  to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests  our leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts  joint ventures or some other type of arrangement 
we believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the internal revenue service irs will agree with this characterization 
if the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes  neither host inc nor either of our subsidiary reits would be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to reits and each likely would lose its reit status 
if our affiliated lessees fail to qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries  each of host inc and its subsidiary reits would fail to qualify as a reit 
rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of host inc will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to reits 
we lease substantially all of our hotels to our subsidiary that is taxable as a regular c corporation and that has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to host inc so long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary  it will not be treated as a related party tenant 
we believe that our affiliated lessees have qualified and will continue to qualify  and that the taxable reit subsidiaries of each of our subsidiary reits have qualified and will continue to qualify  to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not challenge the status of a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in disqualifying any of our affiliated lessees including the taxable reit subsidiaries of our subsidiary reits from treatment as a taxable reit subsidiary  it is possible that 
table of contents host inc or a subsidiary reit would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to reits and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests 
if host inc or a subsidiary reit failed to meet either the asset tests or the gross income tests  each likely would lose its reit status 
despite the reit status of each of host inc and its subsidiary reits  we remain subject to various taxes 
one of the subsidiary reits of host inc will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate on built in gain recognized as a result of the sale of one or more of its hotel assets prior to the expiration of the applicable year holding period  including certain hotels acquired from starwood and its affiliates in the total amount of gain on which the subsidiary reit would be subject to corporate income tax if all of its built in gain assets were sold in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of the applicable year holding period would be material to it 
in addition  we expect that we could recognize other substantial deferred tax liabilities in the future without any corresponding receipt of cash 
notwithstanding host inc s status as a reit  host inc 
and our subsidiaries including our subsidiary reits are subject to some federal  state  local and foreign taxes on their income and property 
for example  host inc and our subsidiary reits will pay tax on certain types of income that are not distributed and will be subject to a excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
moreover  the taxable reit subsidiaries of host inc and our subsidiary reits are taxable as regular c corporations and will pay federal  state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates  and foreign taxes to the extent that they own assets or conduct operations in international jurisdictions 
host lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc if the irs were to challenge successfully host lp s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  host inc would cease to qualify as a reit and would suffer other adverse consequences 
we believe that host lp qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
as a partnership  it is not subject to federal income tax on its income 
instead  each of its partners  including host inc  is required to report and pay tax  if applicable  on such partner s allocable share of its income 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge host lp s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating host lp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  host inc would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and  accordingly  cease to qualify as a reit 
if host lp fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or host inc fails to qualify as a reit  either failure would cause an event of default under host lp s credit facility that  in turn  could constitute an event of default under host lp s outstanding debt securities 
also  the failure of host lp to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would cause it to become subject to federal  state and foreign corporate income tax  which tax would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners  including host inc as a reit  each of host inc and its subsidiary reits is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity securities 
subject to certain exceptions  a reit generally is prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that the value of such securities exceeds of the value of the reit s total assets  the securities owned by the reit represent more than of the issuer s outstanding voting securities  or the reit owns more than of the value of the issuer s outstanding securities 
a reit is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the value test and the vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable reit subsidiary 
however  a reit may not own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than of the value of the reit s total assets 
if host inc or any of its subsidiary reits were to violate these ownership limitations  each likely would lose its reit status 

table of contents each of host inc or its subsidiary reits may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel 
the federal income tax provisions applicable to reits provide that any gain realized by a reit on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a excise tax 
under existing law  whether property  including hotels  is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction 
we intend to hold our hotels for investment with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels consistent with our investment objectives 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the excise tax 
risks relating to redemption of op units a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences 
a holder whose op units are redeemed will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units 
the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives  and the amount of host lp s nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units 
the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holder s basis in the op units redeemed which basis includes the amount of host lp s nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units 
it is possible that the amount of gain and or the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives 
if a holder of op units elects to offer them for redemption  the original receipt of the op units may be subject to tax 
if a holder of op units elects to have its units redeemed  particularly within two years of receiving them  there is a risk that the original receipt of the op units may be treated as a taxable sale under the disguised sale rules of the internal revenue code 
subject to several exceptions  the tax law generally provides that a partner s contribution of property to a partnership and a simultaneous or subsequent transfer of money or other consideration from the partnership to the partner will be presumed to be a taxable sale 
in particular  if money or other consideration is transferred by a partnership to a partner within two years of the partner s contribution of property  the transactions are presumed to be a taxable sale of the contributed property  unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the transfers are not a sale 
on the other hand  if two years have passed between the original contribution of property and the transfer of money or other consideration  the transactions will not be presumed to be a taxable sale  unless the facts and circumstances clearly establish that they should be so treated 
differences between an investment in shares of host inc common stock and op units may affect redeemed holders of op units 
if a holder of op units elects to have op units redeemed  we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host inc s common stock in exchange for the op units 
although an investment in shares of host inc s common stock is substantially similar to an investment in op units  there are some differences between ownership of op units and ownership of host inc common stock 
these differences include form of organization  management structure  voting rights  liquidity and federal income taxation  some of which may be material to investors

on october   keystone filed an amended counterclaim and later  a third party claim  alleging that we had tortiously interfered with keystone s attempted sale of the property and that we slandered keystone s title to the property 
on february   we received an adverse jury verdict in the th judicial district court of bexar county  texas 
the jury found that we tortiously interfered with the attempted sale by keystone of the land under the san antonio marriott rivercenter and awarded keystone million in damages  plus statutory interest 
in addition  the jury found that we slandered keystone s title to the property and awarded keystone million in damages  plus statutory interest 
keystone only will be entitled to receive one of these damage awards 
on february   the jury awarded keystone million in exemplary damages with respect to the second claim

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview host inc operates as a self managed and self administered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host lp  of which host inc is the sole general partner and in which it holds approximately of host lp s common op units as of december  the remaining approximate of host lp s common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners 
host inc has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host lp s day to day management and control 
host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareit s composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties 
we currently own hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional hotels through joint ventures in europe and the asia pacific region 
these hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry 
the majority are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
since  the percentage of revenues generated by our urban and resort conference hotels has increased from to in  as we have focused our acquisition efforts on these hotel types  and similarly disposed of non core assets 
while hotels in these markets still are subject to competitive pressures  we believe this strategy of combining premium brands with superior locations provides opportunities to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of our competitors 
our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business and contract business  which accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our room sales 
similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers 
business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels 
therefore  we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand 
the three key subcategories of the transient business group are retail this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it typically is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates 
it includes the rack rate  which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs 
weekend stays 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally 
these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate 
discount this category encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 
group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
the three key sub categories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 
other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 

table of contents the final category is contract business  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates usually are utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses 
our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements  pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages  utilities  property taxes and other hotel level expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month  which distribution reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation 
revenue from owned hotels represents of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  entertainment and other guest services 
hotel operating expenses represent approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 

table of contents of operating costs and expenses other departmental and support expenses 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf courses  spas  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations 
it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items 
taken separately  these costs represent approximately of our hotel operating expenses 
key performance indicators 
revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include food and beverage or parking  telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it generally is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels  as well as incremental operating profit  than do changes that are driven by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage revenue  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in additional room related costs  with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue 
as a result  changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels 
in discussing our operating results  we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and whose operations have been included in our consolidated results 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements 

table of contents we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non gaap financial measures 
each of these non gaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit  net income and earnings per share 
we provide a more detailed discussion of these non gaap financial measures  how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in non gaap financial measures 
our non gaap financial measures include nareit funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share 
we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt  acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business 
hotel adjusted operating profit and margins 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service  depreciation and corporate expenses and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property level profitability 
we use hotel adjusted operating profit and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
earnings before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we also adjust ebitda for gains and losses related to real estate transactions and impairment losses adjusted ebitda

while the overall growth in the economy since the recession has been slow  particularly with regards to gdp growth and the continued high unemployment  specific 
table of contents drivers of lodging demand have proven to be more resilient  allowing for steady revpar improvements 
in particular  corporate business  which is one of the most important demand drivers of our portfolio  has strengthened as corporate profits and business investment have increased at a much greater rate than the overall economy 
additionally  our properties in gateway markets  such as new york  san francisco  los angeles  seattle  boston  miami and chicago  have benefited from an increase in demand from travel to the us as international arrivals increased through september based on the most recent available report from the office of travel and tourism industries 
growth in at our comparable hotels was both rate and occupancy driven  as room rates improved and occupancy improved basis points to  which is one percentage point above our pre recession occupancy levels in as we enter the third full year of the lodging recovery  our operators have been able to gradually increase room rates  particularly for our transient business  as the occupancy levels at our properties have continued to improve 
the occupancy improvement for the year was driven by an increase in demand from our corporate group business  as reflected in a increase in group room nights compared to food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels increased for the increase was driven primarily by improvements in banquet and audio visual revenues during the first half of the year  while outlet revenue improved during the second half of the year 
banquet and audio visual revenues provide higher overall operating margins than outlet revenue  as catered functions generally are more profitable 
overall  food and beverage revenues increased by compared to  which includes incremental food and beverage revenues from recently acquired hotels of million 
as a result  total revenues for our owned hotels increased million to billion for the year 
in addition to the hotel revenues for our owned hotels described above  our other revenues increased million  which was due primarily to increased revenue from the courtyard by marriott hotels leased from hospitality properties trust hpt 
accordingly  total revenues increased million to approximately billion for approximately million of the increase both in total revenues and revenues for owned hotels resulted from the inclusion of operations from recently acquired hotels  including the grand hyatt washington  which was purchased in july and a full year of operations for hotels purchased in the first quarter of operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased basis points for the full year operating margins are affected significantly by several items  including operations from recently acquired hotels  depreciation  impairments  and corporate expenses

table of contents investing activities acquisitions and new development 
we believe that the lodging industry will continue to present opportunities to acquire hotels at discounts to replacement cost  with growth potential that will provide returns at attractive premiums to our cost of capital 
while the global economic outlook remains unclear  the on going strength of hotel performance  particularly in gateway markets  due to limited new supply and the increasing availability of debt  creates a favorable environment for hotel transactions 
our acquisition strategy also includes the acquisition or development of midscale and upscale properties in select target markets 
during  we completed the following transactions on july   we acquired the room grand hyatt washington for approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition  we also paid million  net  for the ff e replacement fund  working capital and other assets

the ibis and novotel techpark  bangalore opened in and the other five hotels are under various stages of development in chennai and delhi and are expected to open during value enhancement projects 
we also look to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies designed to achieve the highest and best use of all aspects of our properties 
we believe that the successful execution of these projects will create significant value for the company 
during  we focused on the following value enhancement projects on november   we entered into a joint venture agreement the maui jv with hyatt residential group to develop  sell and operate a unit vacation ownership project in maui  hawaii adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort spa for estimated development costs of million  which we expect will be funded with a million construction loan and partner equity contributions

table of contents interest 
the residents of the timeshare units will have access to amenities at our existing resort  for which they will pay a fee that will be included in their timeshare association dues 
in addition to any profits from the sale of timeshare units  we also expect to benefit from synergies created with our existing hotel  including room sales in connection with marketing efforts or transition nights  ancillary revenues from our spa  food and beverage outlets and retail shops  as well as savings related to shared expenses 
construction has begun and the project is expected to open in late on august   we announced a year lease agreement with vornado realty trust vornado to lease the retail and signage space at the new york marriott marquis 
vornado plans to invest approximately million to redevelop and substantially expand the existing retail space  including the conversion of below grade parking to high end retail space and six story  block front  led signage that is expected to improve the hotel s presence on times square 
as a result of the lease  our rental income increased by more than million annually and we would expect significant additional rent increases as the project is completed and leased 
over the term of the lease  each party has options that  if exercised  would result in ownership of the retail space being conveyed to vornado at a price based on the future cash flow of the leased property 
we also are under contract with a luxury homebuilder to sell acres of excess land adjacent to our newport beach marriott hotel spa 
the land  which previously was used for tennis courts  has been approved for the development and sale of luxury condominiums 
the sale is expected to close by mid and is subject to various customary closing conditions 
redevelopment and return on investment capital expenditures 
redevelopment and roi projects primarily consist of large scale redevelopment projects  as well as near term capital and operational improvement plans at our newly acquired properties  which we refer to as acquisition projects 
during and  we invested million and million  respectively  in acquisition projects and million and million  respectively  in other projects for a total of million and million  respectively  in redevelopment and roi expenditures 
during  we plan to spend between million to million in acquisition expenditures and million to million for other projects for total redevelopment and roi expenditures of million to million 
in  we continued to implement various projects that were designed specifically to increase the eco efficiency of our hotels  incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology 
significant redevelopment capital expenditures during the year included the following projects the redevelopment projects that began in at the following three properties were completed the atlanta marriott perimeter center  the chicago marriott o hare and the sheraton indianapolis 
these properties have experienced an average revpar increase of for when compared to the pre construction period in sheraton new york hotel towers the completion of the renovation of all  rooms  including major mechanical upgrades to the heating and cooling system as part of the extensive renovation and redevelopment project begun in san diego marriott marquis marina continuation of the extensive renovation and redevelopment project begun in  which in included the completion of the south tower greatroom redesign of the bar  restaurant and grab go outlet 
orlando world center marriott we began the complete enhancement of the pool area  including new water slides and activity areas and new pool dining facilities 
included in our roi expenditures are capital projects at our recently acquired hotels that we considered as part of our initial investment 
significant projects during the year included the million conversion of the former new york helmsley hotel acquired march to the westin new york grand central on october  the hotel is new york city s second westin branded property 
the conversion included a complete renovation of all guest rooms  the ballroom and meeting space  fitness center  lobby and public areas and the heating and cooling systems  as well as a new bar and restaurant 
we also completed the renovation of the rooms at the w new york union square acquired september and began the renovation of all guestrooms at both the manchester grand hyatt san diego acquired march and the grand hyatt washington acquired july 

table of contents renewal and replacement capital expenditures 
we spent million and million on renewal and replacement expenditures during and  respectively 
these projects included the renovation of over  rooms   square feet of public space and  square feet of meeting space in these expenditures are designed to ensure that our high standards for product quality are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace 
major projects completed in included the renovation of  rooms at the boston marriott copley place  all guestrooms at the hyatt regency washington on capitol hill  all rooms at the westin seattle  over  square feet of meeting space at the ritz carlton  buckhead  almost  square feet of meeting space at the w new york and the renovation of guestrooms and the  square foot exhibit hall in the new york marriott marquis 
major renewal and replacement projects that were underway during the fourth quarter of included rooms at the washington marriott at metro center  the room north tower of the orlando world center marriott and  square feet of meeting space at the westin kierland resort spa 
we expect that our investment in renewal and replacement expenditures in will total approximately million to million 
at the midpoint of this range  this represents an approximate decrease when compared to and should result in less business disruption at our properties 
dispositions 
we disposed of four properties over the last months  including the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis on january   for million  including million of ff e replacement funds 
while two of the sales were smaller properties in non core markets  the disposition of the san francisco airport marriott and the atlanta marriott marquis hotels represented opportunities to capitalize on favorable market conditions and rebalance the investments in our portfolio 
for example  the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis reduced our overall market presence in atlanta  which now represents approximately of our total revenues 
during  we believe that transaction volume in the industry will increase as the year progresses and we plan to remain opportunistic with our disposition activity 
financing activities we continued to make progress in on our goal to strengthen our balance sheet by lowering our debt to equity ratio and improving our overall credit statistics 
we believe that lower leverage reduces our overall cost of capital and our earnings volatility and increases our access to capital  thereby providing us with the necessary flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle  which we consider a key competitive advantage 
as our operations have improved  we have focused strategically on raising and deploying capital to improve our leverage ratios  while at the same time completing substantial investments in our portfolio through acquisitions and capital investments 
during the year  we issued approximately billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of and used the proceeds thereof  along with available cash  to repay approximately billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
as a result of these transactions  we have decreased our weighted average interest rate by basis points  to  and lengthened our weighted average debt maturity by years to years 
specifically  during the year we completed the following significant financing transactions 
we issued million of series c senior notes due for net proceeds of approximately million and million series b senior notes due for net proceeds of approximately million 
we entered into a million term loan through an amendment of our credit facility 
the term loan has a five year maturity and a floating interest rate of libor plus basis points based on our leverage ratio at december  we also drew approximately million on a net basis in on the revolving portion of our credit facility 
we redeemed a total of nearly billion of senior notes and exchangeable debentures 
we repaid the million loan with a interest rate on the jw marriott  washington  dc and issued a million mortgage loan secured by the hyatt regency reston 
the new loan bears interest at month libor plus basis points and matures on july   with an additional one year extension at our option subject to debt service and loan to value requirements and other conditions 
we issued million common shares under our at the market offering programs 
the shares were issued at an average price of per share for net proceeds of million 

table of contents we believe  based on the overall strength of our balance sheet  that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to pay our near term debt maturities  fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities 
for a detailed discussion  see liquidity and capital resources 
outlook we believe that the broad economic trends experienced between and should continue in  which likely will translate into moderate growth in lodging demand 
real us gdp growth is anticipated to be in based on consensus estimates 
the slightly muted economic growth prospects in the us relate to the increased tax rates in  as well as continued uncertainty regarding us tax and spending policies and continued elevated unemployment levels 
we anticipate that this uncertainty also will lead to more moderate growth in business investment  particularly in the first half of the year  which historically has been correlated to lodging demand 
we expect slower economic growth in europe  which will affect demand negatively  though key urban markets such as london and paris should outperform the market as a whole 
we expect economic growth in the asia pacific and latin america regions to accelerate  which should bolster lodging demand both for our international properties and our properties located in key domestic gateway markets 
supply growth for upper upscale and luxury hotels is expected to increase from levels  but remain well below the long term industry trend 
as is typical in the lodging cycle  supply growth has lagged the recovery in demand due to the long term planning required for hotel development 
during the current recovery  supply growth also has been hampered first by the lack of available credit during the recession and second by the slow pace of the recovery as  on average  upper upscale hotels in gateway markets continue to trade below replacement cost 
demand has therefore increased at a faster pace than supply  resulting in strong occupancy increases  which is reflected in our strong booking pace for we continue to expect demand to outpace supply in  resulting in a modest increase in occupancy  which we believe will allow operators to shift focus toward improving the mix of business and driving average daily rate increases 
therefore  revpar growth is anticipated to be driven primarily by average daily rate  which should provide an opportunity to drive operating profits 
we also believe that our hotels will benefit in from the improvements made to our portfolio through our capital expenditures program and acquisitions 
we spent over million on major redevelopment and return on investment capital projects between and that we believe have improved significantly the competitive position of our properties  while taking advantage of reduced occupancies and significantly lower construction costs 
we expect that the pace of our capital spending will slow in  which will lessen the disruption experienced compared to and based on the trends discussed above as well as our forecasts for our properties  we believe that comparable hotel revpar will increase to for additionally  we believe that comparable food and beverage and other revenue will increase approximately to for however  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns

food and beverage expense correlates closely with food and beverage revenues  and is affected by occupancy as well as the type of customers staying at the hotel

other property level expenses consist of property taxes  which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities  and property and general liability insurance  and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels

depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in  which includes a million non cash impairment charge related to the westin mission hills resort spa 
the changes in and also reflect the inclusion of depreciation expense for newly acquired properties and recent capital expenditures 
other income and expense corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs  such as employee stock based compensation expense  travel  corporate insurance  legal fees  acquisition related costs  audit fees  building rent and systems costs 
corporate expenses decreased approximately million in corporate expenses in include a charge of million related to the forfeited deposit for the grand hyatt washington transaction 
during  this was partially offset by increases in acquisition and compensation expenses 
corporate expenses increased approximately million in compared to due to the million loss described above and the accrual of million of additional litigation costs  which largely was offset by a decline in employee stock compensation 
the stock based compensation is based on employee performance  as well as host inc s stockholder return relative to other reits and to other lodging companies and will vary significantly due to fluctuations in host inc s stock price 
gain on insurance settlements 
we recorded gains of million and million in and  respectively  related to the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds for two properties in christchurch  new zealand  both of which were affected by an earthquake in february and one of which remains closed 
in  we also recorded a gain of million related to property insurance for two hotels in chile  both of which were affected by an earthquake in february for further information on our insurance settlements  see note to our consolidated financial settlements gain on insurance settlements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million in the increase is due primarily to an increase in costs associated with debt extinguishments including prepayment premiums  the acceleration of deferred financing 
table of contents costs and incremental interest  totaling million in  compared to million in after adjusting for debt extinguishment costs  interest expense declined million in  reflecting the lower weighted average interest rate and overall debt balance 
in addition  savings from our fixed to floating interest rate swap reduced interest expense by million for each of  and the decrease in interest expense during is due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with debt extinguishments including prepayment premiums  the acceleration of deferred financing costs and incremental interest  which totaled million in  compared to million in after adjusting for debt extinguishment costs  interest expense was comparable to levels 
interest income 
interest income in and primarily represents amounts earned on our mortgage loan investment associated with the portfolio of five hotels acquired by the euro jv 
interest income related to the mortgage was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
due to the maturity of the mortgage loan in  we expect interest income to significantly decline in net gains on property transactions and other 
net gains on property transactions and other increased in due to the million gain related to the sale of land to the maui jv  compared to a million gain recorded in for the transfer of the le m ridien piccadilly to the euro jv 
benefit provision for income taxes 
we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes 
the difference between hotel level operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host lp by the trs represents taxable income or loss  on which we record an income tax provision or benefit 
the increase in the tax provision in each of and reflects year over year improvements in property operations recognized by our trs  as well as increases in foreign taxes in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of three hotels disposed of in  one hotel disposed of in  and two hotels disposed of in and represent the results of operations and the gains or losses on the disposition of these hotels during the indicated periods 
the following table summarizes the revenues  income loss before taxes  and the gain loss on dispositions  net of tax  of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations  which includes assets held for sale and the results of sold hotels prior to their disposition for the periods presented in millions revenues income loss before taxes gain loss on dispositions  net of tax liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp  which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations  the incurrence of debt and the issuance of op units 
host inc s only material asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp  therefore  its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp  except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock 
proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units 
additionally  funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore  while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp  we have not included a separate discussion of the liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies to both host inc and host lp overview 
we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash  debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility  given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry 
as operations have improved  we have maintained our focus on strategically decreasing our debt to equity ratio through i acquisitions and other investments  the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances and ii the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt to extend maturity dates and lower interest rates 

table of contents we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt 
we have access to multiple types of financing as over of our debt consists of senior notes  exchangeable debentures and borrowings under our credit facility  all of which are not collateralized by specific hotel properties 
during  we took advantage of lower interest rates to issue new debt and used the proceeds to repay near term maturities  resulting in the issuance of approximately billion of debt that was used to fund the repayment or redemption of approximately billion of senior notes and exchangeable debentures and million of mortgage debt 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate was with a weighted average maturity of years with our near term maturities representing approximately of our total debt million of mortgage debt 
additionally  only of our consolidated hotels were encumbered by mortgage debt 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio  withstand declines in operating cash flow  pay near term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs 
as of december   we have approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available capacity under our credit facility 
we may continue to access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs

we use cash for acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt payments  operating costs  corporate and other expenses  as well as dividends and distributions to stockholders and unitholders 
as a reit  host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gain  on an annual basis 
funds used by host inc to make cash distributions are provided by host lp our primary sources of cash are cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances 
for  our debt maturities consist of a million mortgage on the orlando world center marriott and a million mortgage on the westin denver downtown 
the mortgage on the westin denver downtown is due in  however  we intend to repay the loan in december without penalty as the related interest expense and principal amortization are scheduled to significantly increase at that time 
we also have million of debt maturing in  which includes million of exchangeable debentures  subject to a put option by holders in that year 
for more information on debt maturities for later years see financial condition 

table of contents capital resources 
we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
as a result  the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure 
our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt  make distributions and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants  which include  among other things  the allowable amounts of leverage  interest coverage and fixed charges 
during and  we decreased our near term debt maturities  expanded our borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants 
on april   host inc entered into sales agency financing agreements with bny mellon capital markets  llc and scotia capital usa inc  through which host inc 
may issue and sell  from time to time  shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
the agreements followed the completion of million of sales under a similar agreement with bny mellon capital markets  inc  that was entered into in the sales will be made in at the market offerings under sec rules  including sales made directly on the new york stock exchange 
host inc is not under an obligation to sell any shares 
bny mellon capital markets  llc and scotia capital usa inc are acting as sales agents 
during  we issued million shares through these programs at an average price of per share  for net proceeds of million 
as of december   we have million of capacity remaining under the program 
if  at any time  we determine that market conditions are favorable  after taking into account our liquidity requirements  we may seek to issue and sell shares of host inc common stock in registered public offerings  including through sales directly on the new york stock exchange under our existing or a future at the market offering program  or to issue and sell shares of host inc preferred stock 
we also may seek to cause host lp to issue debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock or senior notes 
given our total debt level and maturity schedule  we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time  taking advantage of favorable market conditions 
in february of  host inc s board of directors authorized repurchases up to million of senior notes  exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms 
separately  the board of directors authorized redemptions and repurchases of all or a portion of million principal amount of our exchangeable debentures 
any redemption of the exchangeable debentures will not reduce the million of board authority noted above to repurchase other debt securities 
we may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs 
accordingly  in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets  we may  at any time  subject to applicable securities laws  be considering  or be in discussions with respect to  the purchase or sale of common stock  exchangeable debentures and or senior notes 
any such transactions may  subject to applicable securities laws  occur simultaneously 
we continue actively to explore potential acquisitions and anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of properties  but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc  or by issuances of op units by host lp  the incurrence of debt  available cash or advances under our credit facility 
given the nature of these transactions  we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review  bid on or negotiate to purchase 
we may acquire additional properties through various structures  including transactions involving single assets  portfolios  joint ventures and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits 
counterparty credit risk 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk  which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price 
we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact  if any  of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial 
table of contents condition 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions  access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts 
our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited 
our exposure with regard to our cash and the million available under our credit facility is mitigated  as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions 
at december   the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions 
sources and uses of cash 
our sources of cash include cash from operations  proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from asset sales 
uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions  investments in our joint ventures  capital expenditures  operating costs  debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders 
we anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar during cash provided by operations 
our cash provided by operations for increased million to million compared to  primarily due to improved operating profit at our hotels 
cash used in investing activities 
approximately million of cash was used in investing activities during compared to  million in in addition to the acquisition  investment and disposition activity detailed in the charts below  we spent approximately million on capital expenditures  an increase of million from our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for were approximately million  which reflects an increase of approximately from levels 
our renewal and replacement capital expenditures generally are funded by the furniture  fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels typically of property revenues and by our available cash 
we also spent approximately million in on roi redevelopment projects  which reflects an increase of approximately compared to levels 
capital expenditures have totaled approximately billion over the past five years 
as a result  we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position relative to their market competitors

senior notes 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lp s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp pledges and guarantees 
under the senior notes indenture  all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt similarly are required to guarantee debt issuances under the indenture 
also  to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp are pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility  such collateral likewise is required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indenture 
while the credit facility currently does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests  such guarantees or pledges subsequently will be required in the event that host lp s leverage ratio exceeds x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating 
in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered  the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility  as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
if triggered  the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host us and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would not provide guarantees or pledges of equity interests 
further  if at any time our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating  such guarantees and pledges may be released 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  should our senior notes fall below their current investment grade rating  our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x 
this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters  giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan to establish its fair value and approximately million of non cash interest expense recorded in related to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture  however  in certain circumstances  we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
these unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants unless they are guarantors and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture 
if we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted 
table of contents subsidiaries  neither the ebitda generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these entities would be included in our ratio calculations 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness  host inc s ability to pay dividends and host lp s ability to make distributions  should our senior notes fall below their current investment grade rating  include maintaining total indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values  excluding intangible assets  and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as our senior notes maintain their current investment grade rating  or we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
in addition  even if our senior notes are not rated investment grade and we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions  we still are permitted to incur certain types of debt  including i credit facility debt  ii refinancing debt  iii up to million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount  and iv up to million of other debt 
we also are permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host inc s reit status 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as host lp s ability to make distributions on  redeem or repurchase its op units  make investments  permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries  sell assets  guarantee indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
compliance with certain of these covenants is suspended while our senior notes maintain an investment grade rating 
in addition  should our senior notes fall below an investment grade rating  our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets defined in the indenture as undepreciated property book value of not less than of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages 
this coverage requirement is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above whose consequences  where we fall below the coverage level  are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions  but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture 
as of december   when our senior notes did not have an investment grade rating  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture 
the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture as of december  actual ratio covenant requirement if no longer investment grade unencumbered assets tests minimum ratio of total indebtedness to total assets maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total assets maximum ratio of ebitda to interest coverage ratio x minimum ratio of x exchangeable debentures 
as of december   we have two issuances of exchangeable senior debentures outstanding million of debentures that were issued on december  the debentures and million of debentures that were issued on march  the debentures 
we redeemed for cash during the outstanding million of debentures that were issued on march  debentures  collectively referred to with the debentures and the debentures as the debentures 
debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes 
holders have the right to require us to purchase the debentures at a price equal to of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest the put option on certain dates subsequent to their respective issuances 
holders of the debentures also have the right to exchange the debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions  including at any time at which the closing price of host inc s common stock is more than for the debentures or for the debentures of the exchange price per share for at least of consecutive trading days during certain periods or at any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption 
we can redeem for cash all  or part of  any of the debentures at any time subsequent to each of their respective redemption dates at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
if  at any time  we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price  we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price 
the 
table of contents exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of host inc s common stock 
upon exchange  the debentures would be exchanged for host inc s common stock and the debentures would be exchanged for host inc s common stock  cash or a combination thereof  at our option 
currently  none of the debentures are exchangeable by holders 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the following table details our outstanding debentures as of december  maturity date next put option date redemption date outstanding principal amount current exchange rate for each  of principal current equivalent exchange price exchangeable share equivalents in millions in shares in shares debentures million debentures million total we separately account for the liability and equity components of our exchangeable debentures in order to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our non convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date 
accordingly  for the debentures  we record the liability components thereof at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt the date holders may exercise their option to put the debentures to us  however  there is no effect on our cash interest payments 
we measured the fair value of the debt components of the debentures and debentures at issuance based on effective interest rates of and  respectively 
as a result  we attributed million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the debentures 
this amount represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in host inc s additional paid in capital and host lp s partner s capital on the consolidated balance sheets

on november   we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  jpmorgan chase bank  na  as syndication agent  wells fargo bank  na  deutsche bank ag new york branch and the bank of nova scotia as co documentation agents  and certain other agents and lenders 
the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to billion  including a foreign currency subfacility for canadian dollars  australian dollars  new zealand dollars  japanese yen  euros and british pound sterling of up to the foreign currency equivalent of million  subject to a lower amount in the case of new zealand dollar borrowings 
the credit facility also provides a subfacility of up to million for swingline borrowings and a subfacility of up to million for issuances of letters of credit 
host lp also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility by up to million  subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of november  with an option for host lp to extend the term for one additional year  subject to certain conditions  including the payment of an extension fee 
at december   we have million of available capacity under our credit facility 

table of contents credit facility term loan 
on july   we expanded the credit facility to add a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the term loan was established through an exercise of the option under the credit facility to increase the amount of the facility by up to million 
we also amended the credit facility to allow us to retain the ability to exercise this option in the future for up to an additional million of commitments  subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and the satisfaction of the other conditions specified in the credit facility 
the term loan will mature in july the maturity date of the revolving loan commitments under the credit facility remains unchanged 
the term loan does not require any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity 
we will pay interest on the term loan at floating interest rates plus a margin ranging from i to basis points depending on host lp s consolidated leverage ratio or ii following the date on which host lp s long term unsecured debt rating is investment grade and host lp elects ratings based pricing  to basis points depending on host lp s unsecured long term debt rating 
the term loan otherwise is subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees and pledges of security interests in subsidiaries  operational covenants  financial covenants and events of default as discussed below 
collateral and guarantees 
the credit facility does not currently include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries or any other security  and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lp s leverage ratio exceeds x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating 
in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered  the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility  as well as the notes outstanding under host lp s senior notes indenture  interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
even when triggered  the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host us and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests 
further  if at any time our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters or host lp has an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating  such guarantees and pledges may be released 
prepayments 
voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty 
the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values to below billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new investments 
at december   we have adjusted total assets  as defined in our credit facility  of billion 
financial covenants 
the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage 
we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x  our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than x 
the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loan is repaid  we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants 
these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters  giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan to establish its fair value and non cash interest expense due to the implementation in of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept  under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of million are deducted from our total debt balance 

table of contents we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility 
the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december  actual ratio covenant requirement for all years leverage ratio x maximum ratio of x fixed charge coverage ratio x minimum ratio of x unsecured interest coverage ratio a x minimum ratio of x a if at any time our leverage ratio is above x  our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to x 
interest and fees 
we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin either i ranging from to basis points depending on host lp s consolidated leverage ratio  or ii following the date on which host lp s long term unsecured debt rating is investment grade and host lp elects ratings based pricing  ranging from to basis points depending on host lp s unsecured long term debt rating 
based on our leverage ratio at december  of x  we would be able to borrow at a rate of libor plus basis points 
while we are using leverage based pricing  to the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of to basis points  depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period 
upon attainment of an investment grade unsecured debt rating and election of ratings based pricing  in lieu of paying an unused commitment fee  we instead would pay a facility fee ranging from basis points to basis points  depending on our rating and regardless of usage 
the interest rate margin on the term loan can range from to basis points depending on host lp s consolidated leverage ratio or  under certain circumstances  in the event that host lp s long term unsecured debt rating is investment grade  from to basis points 
other covenants and events of default 
the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters 
certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  as currently is the case 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments  dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
additionally  the credit facility s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture 
these provisions  under certain circumstances  limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing  and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host inc s tax status as a reit 
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature  and provides that  upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default  payment of all amounts payable under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders commitments may be terminated 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default  all amounts payable under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments automatically will terminate 
mortgage and other debt 
as of december   we had hotels that were secured by mortgage debt 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets  except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions

mortgage debt of consolidated and unconsolidated partner interests 
for the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party non controlling partnership interests  the portion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the non controlling interests  based on their percentage of ownership of the ventures  is approximately million 
additionally  we have non controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method 
the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships and joint ventures attributable to us  based on our percentage of ownership thereof  was million at december  this debt balance primarily is attributable to our approximate one third ownership interest in the euro jv and our interest in the asia pacific jv 
the mortgage debt related to the hotels owned by our euro jv contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty 
the debt of all of our unconsolidated partnerships or ventures is non recourse to us

distribution dividend policy 
host inc is required to distribute at least of its annual taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash 
funds used by host inc to pay dividends are provided through distributions from host lp as of december   host inc is the owner of approximately of host lp s common op units 
the remaining approximate of host lp s common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners 
each op unit may be offered for 
table of contents redemption by the holders thereof for cash or  at the election of host inc  host inc 
common stock based on the then current conversion ratio 
the current conversion ratio was adjusted from to shares of host inc common stock for each op unit as a result of host inc s special dividend in  of which was paid in shares of host inc common stock 
this adjustment was made to avoid any unintended dilution as a result of the portion of host inc s special dividend paid in common stock to its stockholders 
investors should take into account the non controlling position of host lp op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc to its stockholders  as these holders of op units share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding op units 
for example  if host inc paid a per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on the payment of a per common unit distribution by host lp to host inc  as well as to other common op unitholders 
during  host inc s board of directors declared dividends of per share beginning in the first quarter at per share and increasing by per share each quarter thereafter on host inc s common stock 
accordingly  host lp made a distribution of per unit on its common op units 
host inc s policy on common dividends is generally to distribute  over time  of its taxable income 
on february   the board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share on its common stock 
the dividend will be paid on april  to stockholders of record on march  the amount of any future dividend will be determined by host inc s board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements 
we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements  under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements european joint venture 
the euro jv consists of two separate funds  with our partners being apg strategic real estate pool nv  an affiliate of a dutch pension fund  and jasmine hotels pte ltd  an affiliate of the real estate investment company of the government of singapore investment corporation pte ltd gic re 
we serve as the general partner for the joint venture and have a combined general and limited partner interest of in euro jv fund i and in euro jv fund ii 
due to the ownership structure and substantive participating rights of the non host limited partners  including approval over financing  acquisitions and dispositions  and annual operating and capital expenditure budgets  it is not consolidated in our financial statements 
as of december   the total assets of the euro jv are approximately billion billion 
our investment is approximately million million  of which euro jv fund i is million million and euro jv fund ii is million million 
as of december   the partners have funded approximately million  or  of the total equity commitment for euro jv fund i and million  or  of the total equity commitment for euro jv fund ii 
the partners expect to utilize the remaining commitment for euro jv fund i for capital expenditures and financing needs 
as general partner  we earn a management fee based on the amount of equity commitments and equity invested 
in  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million of management fees  respectively 
on november   euro jv fund ii acquired five hotels from whitehall street global real estate limited partnership comprising  rooms in two cities paris and amsterdam for approximately million million  plus the acquisition of the related ff e replacement fund of million million  and entered into a million million loan secured by the properties with an interest rate of approximately 
the loan is non recourse to host 
the euro jv also recorded approximately million million of acquisition costs related to this transaction 
we contributed approximately million million in connection with this acquisition  of which approximately million million consisted of proceeds from our investment in a mortgage loan that we acquired for million million in april on july   the euro jv fund ii acquired the room le m ridien grand hotel in nuremberg  germany  for approximately million million plus million million in acquisition costs 
we contributed approximately million million in connection with this acquisition 

table of contents the euro jv has  million of mortgage debt  including debt incurred in its recent acquisitions  all of which is non recourse to us 
a default of the euro jv mortgage debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt 
the operating performance of the portfolio of six properties located in spain  italy  poland and the united kingdom that secures million of mortgage loans due in is below levels required by certain debt covenants  which performance has triggered covenant defaults and cash sweeps under the loans 
these loans are cross collateralized  meaning that a default under one loan could trigger a default on the loans for the other five properties 
the lenders have granted the euro jv a waiver with respect to the defaults through the april maturity date and currently are discussing the terms of a multi year extension of the maturity of this debt 
we expect that lenders may require more stringent financial covenants  higher loan spreads over libor  and lower loan to value ratios 
these requirements  upon any refinancing or a debt extension transaction  likely will require a partial principal reduction via an equity contribution from the partners of euro jv fund i  including host  that will exceed the remaining commitment of euro jv fund i partners 
no assurances can be made that we will be successful in refinancing this debt or that the partners will agree to increase their commitment 
based on our ownership interest in the euro jv  our portion of the loans is million 
a covenant default also was triggered under a mortgage loan secured by three properties in brussels totaling million that is due in  however  the euro jv reached an agreement with the lender to waive the covenants through maturity 
additionally  the million mortgage secured by the amsterdam hotel matures in  but has two one year extension options  subject to small fees and certain financial covenants 
we have entered into five foreign currency forward sale contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the euro jv 
the forward purchases will occur between february and september we have hedged million approximately million of our investment through these contracts and designated draws under our credit facility in euros 
during and  we recorded a loss of million and a gain of million  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of the forward sale contracts and currency translation of our designated draws in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  including a loss of million in related to designated draws of euros under our credit facility 
the current value of the forward contracts of million is included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet 
the derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  and  in accordance with applicable hedge accounting guidance  are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within host inc s stockholders equity portion and host lp s partners capital portion of their balance sheets

we have a interest in the asia pacific jv with reco hotels jv private limited  an affiliate of gic re 
the initial term of the asia pacific jv is for a period of seven years and is scheduled to expire in march of due to the ownership structure and the substantive participating rights of the non host limited partner  including approval over financing  acquisitions and dispositions  and annual operating and capital expenditure budgets  the asia pacific jv is not consolidated in our financial statements 
the commitment period for equity contributions to the asia pacific jv expired in march we did not extend the commitment period beyond the expiration date  however  as we continue to invest in asia  we may offer gic re opportunities to participate in certain acquisitions through the joint venture or a separate joint venture

on august   the asia pacific jv entered into a a million million mortgage loan with commonwealth bank of australia that is secured by the four points by sheraton 
we received a portion of the proceeds of this loan as repayment of our loan made to acquire the hotel  which we used to repay a million million outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility 

table of contents maui joint venture 
on november   we entered into a joint venture with hyatt residential group the maui jv to develop  sell and operate a unit vacation ownership project in maui  hawaii adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort spa 
we have a ownership interest in the maui jv  which is a non controlling interest as a result of the significant economic rights held by the hyatt member  who also is the managing member 
the total estimated development costs are million  which we expect will be funded with a million construction loan and member contributions 
we anticipate that host s investment in the maui jv will be approximately million 
the joint venture has secured the million construction loan which is jointly and severally guaranteed by both partners 
as of december   we have contributed land valued at million and approximately million in pre formation expenditures 
as of december   the book value of our investment in the maui jv is million  which represents our portion of the historical cost basis of the land plus the pre formation expenditures

the joint venture has secured a million construction loan for this project  but as of december  had not drawn on this facility 
along with white lodging services  we have jointly and severally guaranteed the payment of the loan 
we have invested approximately million for our investment in the joint venture 
due to the significant control rights of our partner  we will not consolidate the joint venture in our financial statements 
tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  inc  hms host and barcel crestline corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
as a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by host lp  we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods 
one of these agreements expires in and the other in guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances  including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which currently owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with respect to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 

table of contents in connection with the sale of two hotels in january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that the likelihood of any liability arising related to these ground leases is remote and  in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
in connection with the sale of the atlanta marriott marquis in january  we retained million of contingent liabilities related to potential environmental liabilities 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements entitled guarantees and contingencies 
contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in this category based on the weighted average interest rate 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years 
the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense 
under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel  and is  therefore  not determinable 
the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
hotels acquired in a business combination 
we record our investments in hotel properties based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we evaluate several factors  including market data for similar assets  expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets 

table of contents other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets  capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets are typically assumed contracts  including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding right to use assets 
classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
in certain situations  a deferred tax liability may be created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date 
any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill 
in very limited circumstances  we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
furthermore  acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
impairment testing 
we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable 
we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property s carrying value over its fair value 
to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life  it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property s carrying value 
in the absence of other factors  we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements 
we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise  such as an expiring ground lease  or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life 
we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimable life of our properties  including critical infrastructure  which is regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or when other events  trends  contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  both from operations and the eventual disposition  expected useful life and holding period  future required capital expenditures  and fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
while we consider all of the above indicators as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows  we reviewed the actual year to date and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december  the projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace  occupancy  room rate and property level operating costs 
as a result of our review  we identified five properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
management considered a range of revpar and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the probability weighted projected cash flows from operations 
to appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the assets was recoverable  we projected cash flows such that the 
table of contents individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations generally within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of approximately over the remaining estimable lives of the properties 
this stabilized growth rate is lower than the projected growth rate for the urban upper upscale properties  which we believe is most representative of our portfolio  over the period from through based on this test  one property exhibited an impaired value at december  for purposes of this test  if we had assumed a growth rate of basis points lower after the return to normalized levels of operations  none of the other four properties identified above would have required further analysis 
management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions 
we recognized impairment expense in the aggregate amount of million and million for and  respectively  based on a change in their estimated hold periods 
other than temporary impairment of an investment 
we review our equity method investments for other than temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other than temporary basis 
triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment  a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment 
our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties  therefore  we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment  as well as considering the impact of other elements ie control premiums  ie we use certain inputs  such as available third party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties  to estimate the expected cash flows 
if an equity method investment is impaired  a loss is recorded for the difference between its fair value and its carrying value 
based on this test  no other than temporary impairment was recorded in classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will not occur 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we typically will classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met host inc s board of directors has approved the sale to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
to the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions  including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  of deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation 
table of contents allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of net deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we occasionally will enter into derivative products  including interest rate and foreign currency swaps  caps and collars 
derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss  based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts and guarantees 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
stock compensation 
we recognize costs resulting from host inc s share based payment transactions over their vesting periods 
we classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards 
the classification of host inc s restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options 
equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant 
liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
awards are classified as liability awards to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements 
the value of these restricted stock awards  less estimated forfeitures  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services 
on january   the compensation policy committee of the board of directors adopted a new compensation plan for senior management the plan  that replaces the expired compensation program 
components of the plan include the following awards restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
these awards vest based on the total shareholder return tsr relative to i the nareit index  ii the s p index and iii a selected lodging company index that serves as a relevant industry asset specific measurement to our competitors 
us based senior management may elect to have amounts withheld for taxes in excess of minimum statutory tax requirements  and  as result  tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as liability awards and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
in contrast  senior management located outside of the us are limited as to the amount of shares they may use for statutory tax requirements  and  as result  tsr awards granted to these employees are classified as equity awards and are recorded at fair value as of the grant date 
the valuation of these awards is a custom calculation that is based on common valuation techniques such as the lattice  binomial and black scholes valuation methodologies 
the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of host inc s common stock  risk free interest rates  actual tsr from the beginning of the performance period through the measurement date  host inc s stock beta as compared to the risk to the average risk of the peer groups 
restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions 
these awards are earned based on the employee achieving a specified performance target  which will be based on the employee s specific management business objectives 
compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable 
if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable  recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome 
for us based senior management  these awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions 
therefore  the value of the shares to be issued by host inc will be based on host inc 
s share price on the reporting date 
stock option awards 
the stock option awards are equity classified awards  as they do not include cash settlement features 
therefore  the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in fair value 
vesting for these awards is based on service conditions 
the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited  and our expected dividend yield 

table of contents on january   host inc granted senior management million restricted shares for performance year which represent the maximum number of shares that can be earned during the year if performance is at the high level of achievement 
vesting of these shares is subject to meeting the performance measures outlined above 
approximately of the restricted shares granted are market based with the remaining performance based 
in addition  the company awarded approximately million stock options with an exercise price of per share for performance year during  we recorded approximately million of stock compensation expense associated with the grant 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in terms of the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the subsidiary 
for the majority of our hotel and real estate investments  we consider those rights to be i approval or amendment of developments plans  ii financing decisions  iii approval or amendments of operating budgets and iv investment strategy decisions 
for those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner  we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the presumption of control as the general partner 
limited partner rights which would preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove us  as the general partner  without cause and substantive participating rights  primarily through voting rights 
we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities vies 
if a subsidiary is a vie  it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies 
we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
we review our subsidiaries and affiliates annually to determine if i they should be considered vies  and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in their characteristics 
foreign currency translation 
the operations of international subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency  which generally is the local currency  and are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period 
the assets and liabilities are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates 
the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives  except when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as qualifying net investment hedges 
comparable hotel operating statistics to facilitate a year to year comparison of our operations  we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses  adjusted operating profit and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments 
we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations  for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared  and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption  or undergone large scale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared 

table of contents the hotel business is capital intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business 
generally  hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels 
a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel  such as rooms  meeting space  lobby  bars  restaurants and other public spaces 
both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set  including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count  rebranding  a significant alteration of the business operations  or the closing of the hotel during the renovation 
we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year 
for example  we acquired the westin chicago river north in august of the hotel was not included in our comparable hotels until january  hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed 
similarly  hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a large scale capital project 
in each case  these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption  or the completion of large scale capital projects  as applicable 
of the hotels we owned on december   have been classified as comparable hotels 
the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december  are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods grand hyatt washington acquired in july  hilton melbourne south wharf acquired in april  the westin new york grand central acquired in march  manchester grand hyatt san diego acquired in march  the portfolio of seven hotels in new zealand acquired in february orlando world center marriott business interruption due to a large scale capital project  which includes fa ade restoration  the shutdown of the main pool and a complete restoration and enhancement of the hotel  including new water slides and activity areas  new pool dining facilities and the renovation of one tower of guestrooms  meeting space and restaurants  atlanta marriott perimeter center business interruption due to extensive renovations  which included renovation of the guest rooms  lobby  bar and restaurant and the demolition of one tower of the hotel  reducing the room count at the hotel  chicago marriott o hare business interruption due to extensive renovations  which included renovating every aspect of the hotel and shutting down over rooms  sheraton indianapolis hotel at keystone crossing business interruption due to extensive renovations  which included the conversion of one tower of the hotel into apartments  reducing the room count  and the renovation of the remaining guest rooms  lobby  bar and meeting space  and san diego marriott marquis marina business interruption due to extensive renovations  which included the renovation of every aspect of the hotel and required the entire hotel to be closed for a period of time 
the operating results of the le m ridien piccadilly  which was transferred to the euro jv fund ii in  and of the four hotels we disposed of in and  as well as the courtyard by marriott properties previously leased from hpt  are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 

table of contents we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type 
these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry 
geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed pacific california  hawaii  oregon and washington  mountain arizona and colorado  north central illinois  indiana  minnesota  missouri and ohio  south central louisiana  tennessee and texas  new england massachusetts and new hampshire  mid atlantic pennsylvania  new jersey and new york  dc metro maryland  virginia and washington  dc  atlanta georgia  florida florida  canada canada  latin america brazil  chile and mexico  and asia pacific australia and new zealand 
property types consist of the following urban hotels located in primary business districts of major cities  suburban hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets  resort conference hotels located in resort conference destinations such as arizona  florida  hawaii and southern california  and airport hotels located at or near airports 
reporting periods 
effective january   marriott announced that it will convert from a week fiscal year to a month calendar year 
while our annual financial statements have always been reported on a calendar basis and are unaffected by this change  our quarterly results have not been on a month calendar quarter basis as they followed marriott s period schedule 
however  beginning with the first quarter of  we will report annual and quarterly operating results on a calendar reporting cycle  which is consistent with the majority of companies in the lodging industry 
we will not restate any previously reported quarterly financial statements to conform to the new presentation 
accordingly  investors may find the following discussion useful when evaluating quarterly operations in with prior year quarterly results for both financial statement presentation and hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
for consolidated statement of operations 
the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott international inc  the manager of a significant percentage of our properties  prior to january  used a fiscal year ending on the friday closest to december and reported twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its us and canadian marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt and starwood  report results on a monthly basis 
host inc  as a reit  is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year basis 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott  modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december in order to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott  but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as the calendar year 

table of contents two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted for periods prior to january  are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march second quarter march june march june third quarter june september june september fourth quarter september december september december while the reporting calendar we adopted for periods prior to january  is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott  another consequence of our calendar is that we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers that use a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately of total revenues of our hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results for years prior to for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our and hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our and comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott in those years for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we used for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results for and will differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations 
hotel result reporting periods for operating statistics and comparable hotel results for marriott managed properties start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter december march january march second quarter march june march june third quarter june september june september fourth quarter september december september december non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures  which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  within the meaning of applicable sec rules 
these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp  ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted  as a measure of performance for host inc  and iii comparable hotel operating results  as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp 
table of contents we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share  which is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as presented  may also not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures  interest expense for ebitda and adjusted ebitda purposes only and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ebitda  adjusted ebitda  nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  nareit ffo per diluted share  adjusted ffo per diluted share  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization 
management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
management uses ebitda to evaluate property level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and  like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share  it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs 
adjusted ebitda historically  management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income  is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance 
adjusted ebitda is also a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios 
we adjust ebitda for the following items  which may occur in any period  and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda real estate transactions we exclude the effect of gains and losses  including the amortization of deferred gains  recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets 
in addition  material gains or losses from the depreciated value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset value often does not reflect its market value as noted below for ffo 
equity investment adjustments we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation  amortization and interest expense  which are 
table of contents excluded from ebitda 
we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investments 
the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture 
consolidated partnership adjustments we deduct the non controlling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the non controlling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships 
the pro rata adjusted ebitda of non controlling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the non controlling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle infrequently  the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we exclude these one time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period 
impairment losses we exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
in addition  we believe that impairment charges  which are based off of historical cost account values  are similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense  both of which are also excluded from ebitda 
acquisition costs under gaap  costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred 
we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda in millions reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda  adjusted ebitda year ended december  net income loss a interest expense depreciation and amortization income taxes discontinued operations b ebitda a gain on dispositions c acquisition costs gain on property insurance settlement non cash impairment charges amortization of deferred gains equity investment adjustments equity in earnings of affiliates pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments consolidated partnership adjustments pro rata adjusted ebitda attributable to non controlling partners in consolidated partnerships adjusted ebitda a a net income loss  ebitda  and adjusted ebitda include the following significant transactions a gain of million in for the sale of the land to the maui jv  business interruption proceeds of million recorded in  and interest income of million for on our mortgage loan investment associated with the portfolio of five hotels acquired by the euro jv  which was paid in full in  compared to million in b reflects interest expense  depreciation and amortization and income taxes included in discontinued operations

table of contents nareit ffo  nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share 
we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as non gaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period  as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities  divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines 
nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation  amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata ffo of those entities on the same basis 
we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization  impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits  even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance 
management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance  in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share  when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit  provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance 
we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items  which may occur in any period  and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt  including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired 
we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock 
we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs 
acquisition costs under gaap  costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred 
we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company 
litigation gains and losses we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business 
we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance

comparable hotel operating results 
we present certain operating results for our hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin  on a comparable hotel  or same 
table of contents store  basis as supplemental information for investors 
our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions  significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs  including expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all information in this section applies to host inc and host lp interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we have no derivative financial instruments that are held for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks 
the interest payments on of our debt are fixed in nature this percentage does not include million of mortgage debt for which we have swapped fixed interest payments for floating interest payments  which largely mitigates the effect of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments 
valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on expected future payments  discounted at risk adjusted rates 
the senior notes and the debentures are valued based on quoted market prices 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by basis points  interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  our future earnings and cash flows by approximately million in the table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in millions  except percentages expected maturity date fair value thereafter total liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total debt interest rate derivative fixed to variable notional fair value asset liability average pay rate average receive rate variable to fixed notional fair value asset liability average pay rate average receive rate the amounts are net of unamortized discounts and premiums 
the interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of december  no adjustments are made for forecast changes in the rate 

table of contents interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
we have designated our floating to fixed interest rate swap derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the purpose of the interest rate swaps is to hedge against changes in cash flows interest payments attributable to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates associated with variable rate debt 
the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swaps 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded to other comprehensive income loss on the accompanying balance sheets 
the hedges were fully effective as of december  the following table summarizes our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in millions total notional maturity swapped all in fixed rate change in fair value gain loss year ended december  transaction date amount date index we pay november a november reuters bbsy february nz february nz bank bill the swap was entered into in connection with the million mortgage loan on the hilton melbourne south wharf 
the swap was entered into in connection with the million mortgage loan on seven properties in new zealand 
interest rate swap derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
we have designated our fixed to floating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges 
we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates 
the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps 
the change in the fair value of the derivative is offset largely by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the month libor rate  which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt 
any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt  which was not significant for the periods presented  is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income loss 
we have three fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of million 
during and  the fair value of the swaps decreased million and increased million  respectively 
as a result  we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the month libor  plus a spread which ranges from to  as opposed to the fixed rate of  on the notional amount of million through march  during each of and  the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by million 
if we were to increase the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve  which for our reverse swaps is month libor  by at december   then the fair value of the swap would decrease million 
similarly  if we were to decrease the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve by at december   then the fair value of the swap would increase by million 
exchange rate sensitivity we have currency exchange risk as a result of our hotel ownership in australia  canada  chile  mexico  brazil  and new zealand and our investment in the european and asia pacific joint ventures 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotels  where possible  we may enter into forward or option foreign currency purchase contracts or designate a portion of the foreign currency draws on our credit facility as hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
as of december   we have six foreign currency forward sale contracts that hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in foreign operations 
these derivatives are considered hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the equity portion of our balance sheets 
the forward sale contracts are valued based on the forward yield curve of the foreign currency to us dollar forward exchange rate on the date of measurement
