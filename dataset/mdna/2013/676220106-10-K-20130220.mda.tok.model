table of contents north american supply chain the company operates a network of dcs  crossdock  and combination facilities across the united states 
in prior years  retail stores were largely replenished through our crossdock flow through facilities where bulk merchandise was sorted for distribution and shipped to the requesting stores about three times per week 
based on our supply chain consolidation  we closed three crossdock facilities in and one in the crossdock function in the markets where crossdocks were closed has been transitioned to the existing dcs within the same markets 
these combination facilities  which share real estate  technology  labor costs and inventory  satisfy the needs of both retail stores and delivery customers 
costs are allocated to the north american retail division and north american business solutions division based on the relative services provided 
benefits of this consolidation include improved inventory management and greater operational efficiency  as well as improved service 
dc activity for the last three years has been as follows open at beginning of period opened acquired closed open at end of period crossdock facility activity for the last three years has been as follows open at beginning of period opened closed open at end of period inventory is held in our dcs at levels we believe sufficient to meet current and anticipated customer needs

during  we acquired additional operations in sweden  adding customers to both the contract and retail distribution channels 

table of contents since  we have participated in a joint venture selling office products and services in mexico and central and south america 
in recent years  this venture  office depot de mexico  has grown in size and scope and now includes retail locations in mexico  colombia  costa rica  el salvador  guatemala  honduras  and panama  as well as call centers and dcs to support the delivery business in certain areas 
since we participate equally in this business with a partner  we account for the activity under the equity method and venture sales of approximately billion in are neither reflected in our revenues nor in our consolidated retail comparable store statistics

merchandising our merchandising strategy is to meet our customers needs by offering a broad selection of nationally branded office products  as well as our own brands products and services 
our selection of own brand products has increased in breadth and level of sophistication over time 
we currently offer general office supplies  computer supplies  business machines and related supplies  and office furniture under various labels  including office depot  viking office products  foray  and ativa 
we classify our products into three categories supplies  technology  and furniture and other 
the supplies category includes products such as paper  binders  writing instruments  school supplies  and ink and toner 
the technology category includes products such as desktop and laptop computers  monitors  tablets  printers  cables  software  digital cameras  telephones  and wireless communications products 
the furniture and other category includes products such as desks  chairs  and luggage  sales in our copy and print centers  and other miscellaneous items 
total company sales by product group were as follows supplies technology furniture and other we buy substantially all of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and other primary suppliers  including direct sourcing of our own brands products from domestic and offshore sources 
we also enter into arrangements with vendors that can lower our unit product costs if certain volume thresholds or other criteria are met 
for additional discussion regarding these arrangements  refer to critical accounting policies in part ii item md a 
we operate separate merchandising functions in north america  europe and asia as well as in our joint ventures 
each group is responsible for selecting  purchasing and pricing merchandise as well as managing the product life cycle of our inventory 
in recent years  we have increasingly used global offerings across all regions to further reduce our product cost while maintaining product quality 
we operate global sourcing offices in shenzhen and hangzhou  china  which allow us to better manage our product sourcing  logistics and quality assurance 
these offices consolidate our purchasing power with asian factories and  in turn  help us to increase the scope of our own brands offerings 
sales and marketing our marketing programs are designed to attract new customers and to drive frequency of customer visits to our stores and web sites 
we regularly advertise in major newspapers in most of our north american markets 
we also advertise through local and national radio  network and cable television advertising campaigns  and direct marketing efforts  such as the internet and social networking 

table of contents we offer customer loyalty programs that provide customers with rewards that can be applied against future office depot purchases or other incentives 
these programs have provided us with valuable information enabling us to market more effectively to our customers 
these programs may change in popularity in the future  and we may make alterations to them from time to time 
we perform periodic competitive pricing analyses to monitor each market  and prices are adjusted as necessary to adhere to our pricing philosophy and further our competitive positioning 
we generally expect that our everyday pricing is competitive with other resellers of office products 
we acquire new customers by selectively mailing specially designed catalogs and by making on premises sales calls to prospective customers 
we also make outbound sales calls using dedicated agents through our telephone account management program 
we obtain the names of prospective customers in new and existing markets through the purchase of selected lists from outside marketing information services and other sources as well as through the use of a proprietary mailing list system 
we also acquire customers through e mail marketing campaigns and online affiliates 
no single customer in any of our divisions accounts for more than of our total sales or accounts receivable 
our business is somewhat seasonal  with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter  following the back to business sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the back to school sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles 
business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods 
copy and print our north american retail stores contain a copy print depot tm offering printing  reproduction  mailing  shipping  and other services 
this includes xerox tm certified print specialist associates to assist with digital imaging and printing and shipping services through ups and the us postal service 
in addition to the in store locations  we operate nine regional print facilities  which support copy and print orders taken in our north american retail and north american business solutions divisions 
we also offer copy and print services to our customers in europe through our e commerce business and certain retail locations 
intellectual property we hold trademark registrations domestically and worldwide and have numerous other applications pending worldwide for the names office depot  viking  ativa  foray  realspace  and others 
we consider the trademark for the office depot name the most significant trademark held by us because of its impact on market awareness across all of our businesses and on customers identification with us 
as with all domestic trademarks  our trademark registrations in the united states are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years  prior to their respective expirations  as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade 
industry and competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in all three divisions 
we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of price  service  relationships and selection 
we compete with office supply stores  wholesale clubs  discount stores  mass merchandisers  internet based companies  food and drug stores  computer and electronics superstores and direct marketing companies 
these companies  in varying degrees  compete with us in substantially all of our current markets 
other office supply retail companies market similarly to us in terms of store format  pricing strategy  product selection and product availability in the markets where we operate  primarily those in the united states 
we anticipate that in the future we will continue to face increased competition from these companies 

table of contents internationally  we compete on a similar basis to north america 
outside of the united states  we sell through contract and catalog channels in countries and operate retail stores  and in three of these countries we also sell through wholly owned or majority owned entities 
additionally  our international division provides office products and services in countries through joint ventures  licensing and franchise agreements  cross border transactions  alliances and other arrangements 
employees as of january   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
our workforce is largely non union and our labor relations are generally good 
in certain international locations  changes in staffing or work arrangements may need approval of local works councils or other bodies 
environmental activities as both a significant user and seller of paper products  we have developed environmental practices that are values based and market driven 
our environmental initiatives center on three guiding principles recycling and pollution reduction  sustainable forest management  and issue awareness and market development for environmentally preferable products 
we offer thousands of different products containing recycled content  including from to post consumer waste content paper and technology recycling services in our retail stores 
office depot continues to implement environmental programs in line with our stated environmental vision to increasingly buy green  be green and sell green including environmental sensitivity in our packaging  operations and sales offerings 
our green retail store prototype design is based on our austin  texas store  which received a leadership in energy and environmental design leed gold certification from the united states green building council in december in  the united states green building council awarded our global headquarters in boca raton  florida a leed gold certification under the operations and maintenance rating system and we were the first office supplies retailer with a headquarters building certified under any of the leed rating systems

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses  important factors that are specific to our industry and our company could materially impact our future performance and results 
we have provided below a list of risk factors that should be reviewed when considering investing in our securities 
these are not all the risks we face  and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations 
declines in business and consumer spending could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
our operating results and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on business and consumer spending 
the decline in business and consumer spending resulting from the global recession has caused our comparable store sales to continue to decline from prior periods and we have experienced similar declines in most of our other domestic and international businesses 
our business and financial performance may continue to be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions and the level of consumer debt and interest rates  which may cause a continued or further decline in business and consumer spending 

table of contents our business is highly competitive and failure to adequately differentiate ourselves or respond to shifting consumer demands could adversely impact our financial performance 
the office products market is highly competitive and we compete locally  domestically and internationally with office supply stores  including staples and officemax  wholesale clubs such as costco and bjs  mass merchandisers such as wal mart and target  computer and electronics superstores such as best buy  internet based companies such as amazon 
com  food and drug stores  discount stores  and direct marketing companies 
many competitors have also increased their presence by broadening their assortments or broadening from retail into the delivery and e commerce channels  while others have substantially greater financial resources to devote to sourcing  marketing and selling their products 
product pricing is also becoming ever more competitive  particularly among competitors on the internet 
in order to achieve and maintain expected profitability levels  we must continue to grow by adding new customers and taking market share from competitors 
in addition  consumers are utilizing more technology and purchasing less paper  file storage and similar products 
if we are unable to provide technology solutions and services that meet consumer needs or if we are unable to effectively compete  our sales and financial performance will be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our customers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
with the increasing use of computers  tablets  mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online  we offer full and mobile versions of our website www 
officedepot 
com and applications for mobile phones and tablets 
in addition  we are increasing the use of social media as a means of interacting with our customers and enhancing their shopping experiences 
multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors 
if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract third parties with the specialized skills needed to support our multichannel platforms  or are unable to implement improvements to our customer facing technology in a timely manner  our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if our web site and our other customer facing technology systems do not function as designed  we may experience a loss of customer confidence and satisfaction  data security breaches  lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases  which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 
we do a significant amount of business with government entities and loss of this business could negatively impact our results 
one of our largest us customer groups consists of various state and local governments  government agencies and non profit organizations 
contracting with state and local governments is highly competitive  subject to federal and state procurement laws  requires more restrictive contract terms and can be expensive and time consuming 
bidding such contracts often requires that we incur significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a contract 
our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the federal and various state and local governments is highly dependent on cost effective performance and is also sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and us  state and local government budgets  which in the current economy continue to decrease 
we service a substantial amount of government agency business through agreements with consortiums of governmental and non profit entities 
if we are unsuccessful in retaining these customers  or if there is a significant reduction in sales under our large government contracts or if we lose these contracts  it could adversely impact our financial results 
if a significant number of our vendors demand accelerated payments or require cash on delivery  such demands could have an adverse impact on our operating cash flow and result in severe stress on our liquidity 
we purchase products for resale under credit arrangements with our vendors and have been able to negotiate payment terms that are approximately equal in length to the time it takes to sell the vendor s products 
when the global economy is experiencing weakness as it has over the last five years  vendors may seek credit insurance to protect against non payment of amounts due to them 
if we continue to experience declining operating performance  and if we experience severe liquidity challenges  vendors may demand that we accelerate our payment for their products 
borrowings under our existing credit facility could reach maximum levels under such circumstances  causing us to seek alternative liquidity measures  but we may not be able to meet our obligations as they become due until we secure such alternative measures 

table of contents a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds  refinance indebtedness  obtain new funding or issue securities 
historically  we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business 
together  these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs  as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings  capital improvements and acquisitions 
due to the downturn in the global economy  our operating results have declined 
further deterioration in our financial results could negatively impact our credit ratings  our liquidity and our access to the capital markets 
certain of our existing indebtedness matures in and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness 
if we are able to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancing on more favorable terms than the terms of our existing indebtedness 
a default under our credit facility could significantly restrict our access to funding and adversely impact our operations 
our asset based credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that is operative only when borrowing availability is below million or prior to a restricted transaction  such as incurring additional indebtedness  acquisitions  dispositions  dividends  or share repurchases 
the agreement also contains representations  warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and default provisions 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit agreement  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we may not have sufficient assets to repay our asset based credit facility and our other indebtedness 
also  should there be an event of default  or a need to obtain waivers following an event of default  we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and or more restrictive covenants in future periods 
acceleration of our obligations under our credit facilities would permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations 
loss of key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business 
we depend on our executive management team and other key personnel  and the loss of certain personnel could result in the loss of management continuity and institutional knowledge 
we depend heavily upon our retail labor force to identify new customers and provide desired products and personalized customer service to existing customers 
the market for qualified employees  with the right talent and competencies  is highly competitive  and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers may adversely affect our ability to conduct operations in our stores in accordance with the standards that we have set 
we also depend on our executive officers as well as other key personnel 
although certain members of our executive team have entered into agreements relating to their employment with us  most of our key personnel are not bound by employment agreements  and those with employment or retention agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans  which may have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents disruption of global sourcing activities or our own brands quality concerns could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings 
in recent years  we have substantially increased the number and types of products that we sell under our own brands including office depot and other proprietary brands 
sources of supply may prove to be unreliable  or the quality of the globally sourced products may vary from our expectations and standards 
economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source such products  as well as shipping and dockage issues  could adversely impact the availability or cost of such products  or both 
moreover  as we seek indemnities from the manufacturers of these products  the uncertainty of realization of any such indemnity and the lack of understanding of us product liability laws in certain parts of asia make it more likely that we may have to respond to claims or complaints from our customers 
most of our goods imported to the us arrive from asia through ports located on the us west coast and we are therefore subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest  security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports 
changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate can cause fluctuations in our overall tax rate impacting our reported earnings 
our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
depending upon the sources of our income  any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  and the tax filing positions we take in these jurisdictions  our overall tax rate may fluctuate significantly from other companies or even our own past tax rates 
at any given point in time  we base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of income likely to be generated in any given geography 
the loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions  a change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country  changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes  changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate 
we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  which from time to time may involve class action lawsuits  state and federal governmental inquiries  audits and investigations  employment  tort  consumer litigation and intellectual property litigation 
at times  such matters may involve directors and or executive officers 
certain of these legal proceedings  including government investigations  may be a significant distraction to management and could expose our company to significant liability  including damages  fines  penalties  attorneys fees and costs  and non monetary sanctions  including suspensions and debarments from doing business with certain government agencies  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
failure to successfully manage our domestic and international business could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
circumstances outside of our control could negatively impact anticipated store openings  joint ventures and franchise arrangements 
we cannot provide assurance that our new store openings  including some newly sized or formatted stores or retail concepts  will be successful 
there may be unintended consequences of adding joint venture and franchising partners to the office depot model  such as the potential for compromised operational control in certain countries and inconsistent international brand image 
these joint venture and franchise arrangements may also add complexity to our processes and may require unanticipated operational adjustments in the future that could adversely impact our operations and financial results 

table of contents we face such risks as foreign currency fluctuations  potential unfavorable foreign trade policies or unstable political and economic conditions 
as of december   we sold to customers in countries throughout north america  europe  asia  latin america  and australia 
we operate wholly owned entities  majority owned entities and participate in joint ventures and alliances globally 
sales from our operations outside the us are denominated in local currency  which must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and therefore our consolidated earnings can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in world currency markets 
we are required to comply with multiple foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country  requiring significant management attention and cost 
in addition  the business cultures in certain areas of the world are different than those that prevail in the us  and we may be at a competitive disadvantage against other companies that do not have to comply with standards of financial controls or business integrity that we are committed to maintaining as a us publicly traded company 
changes in the regulatory environment may increase our expenses and may negatively impact our business 
we are subject to regulatory matters relating to our corporate conduct and the conduct of our business  including securities laws  consumer protection laws  advertising regulations  and wage and hour regulations 
certain jurisdictions have taken a particularly aggressive stance with respect to such matters and have implemented new initiatives and reforms  including more stringent disclosure and compliance requirements 
to the extent that we are subject to more challenging regulatory environments and enhanced legal and regulatory requirements  such exposure could have a material adverse effect on our business  including the added cost of increased compliance measures that we may determine to be necessary 
healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition 
rising healthcare costs and interest in universal healthcare coverage in the united states have resulted in government and private sector initiatives proposing significant healthcare reforms 
the patient protection and affordable care act  signed into law on march   is expected to increase our annual employee health care costs  with the most significant increases commencing in we cannot predict the extent of the effect of this statute  or any future state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation  will have on us 
however  an expansion in government s role in the us healthcare industry could result in significant long term costs to us  which could in turn adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition 
increases in fuel and other commodity prices could have an adverse impact on our earnings 
we operate a large network of stores and delivery centers around the globe 
as such  we purchase significant amounts of fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers as well as shipping costs to import products from overseas 
while we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases  the underlying commodity costs associated with this transport activity have been volatile in recent years and disruptions in availability of fuel could cause our operating costs to rise significantly to the extent not covered by our hedges 
additionally  other commodity prices  such as paper  may increase and we may not be able to pass along such costs to our customers 
fluctuations in the availability or cost of our energy and other commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
disruptions of our computer systems could adversely affect our operations 
we rely heavily on computer systems to process transactions  manage our inventory and supply chain and to summarize and analyze our global business 
certain systems are at or near the end of life and need to be replaced 
if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly  or  if we do not replace or upgrade certain systems  we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience an interruption of our normal business activities or loss of critical data 
we are undertaking certain system enhancements and conversions to increase productivity and efficiency  that  if not done properly  could divert the attention of our workforce during development and implementation and constrain for some time our ability to provide the level of service our customers demand 
also  once implemented  the new systems and technology may not provide the intended efficiencies or anticipated benefits and could add costs and complications to our ongoing operations

through our sales and marketing activities  we collect and store certain personal information that our customers provide to purchase products or services  enroll in promotional programs  register on our web site  or otherwise communicate and interact with us 
this may include names  addresses  phone numbers  email addresses  contact preferences  and payment account information 
we also gather and retain information about our employees in the normal course of business 
we may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business

our business could be disrupted due to weather related factors 
our operations are heavily concentrated in the southern us including florida and the gulf coast 
as such  we may be more susceptible than some of our competitors to the effects of tropical weather disturbances  such as hurricanes 
in addition  winter storm conditions in areas that have a large concentration of our business activities could also result in lost retail sales  supply chain constraints or other business disruptions 
we believe that we have taken reasonable precautions to prepare for weather related events  but our precautions may not be adequate to mitigate the adverse effect of such events in the future 
the unionization of a significant portion of our workforce could increase our overall costs and adversely affect our operations 
we have a large employee base and while our management believes that our employee relations are good  we cannot be assured that we will not experience pressure from labor unions or become the target of campaigns similar to those faced by our competitors 
the potential for unionization could increase if federal legislation is passed that would facilitate labor organization 
significant union representation would require us to negotiate wages  salaries  benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results of operations by significantly increasing our labor costs or otherwise restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations

the initial dividend rate remains on both the series a and series b preferred stock  and dividends are paid quarterly in cash or are added to the liquidation preference at our option and are subject to certain restrictions 
to the extent that dividends are added to the liquidation preference  this further increases the ownership interest of the investors and dilutes the interests of the common shareholders

investor interests can differ from each other and from other corporate interests and it is possible that the investors may have interests that differ from management and those of other shareholders 
if the investors were to sell  or otherwise transfer  all or a large percentage of their holdings  our stock price could decline and we could find it difficult to raise capital  if needed  through the sale of additional equity securities 

table of contents we have incurred significant impairment charges and we continue to incur significant impairment charges 
during  we recognized non cash asset impairment charges in our north american retail division of approximately million 
these charges reflect greater than anticipated downturns in sales at certain lower performing stores 
we recognized store asset impairment charges in the north american retail division of million during we assess past performance and make estimates and projections of future performance quarterly at an individual store level 
reduced sales  our shift in strategy to be less promotional  as well as competitive factors and changes in consumer spending habits resulted in a downward adjustment of anticipated future cash flows for the individual stores that resulted in the impairment 
we foresee challenges in the market and economy that could adversely impact our operations 
to the extent that forward looking sales and operating assumptions are not achieved and are subsequently reduced  or if we commit to a more aggressive store downsizing strategy  including allocating capital to further modify store formats  additional impairment charges may result 
additionally  the company has million of goodwill at december   with million in the international division 
we measure goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or earlier if indicators of possible impairment are identified 
changes in the numerous variables associated with the judgments  assumptions and estimates we make  in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill  including changes resulting from macroeconomic challenges in international markets  or disposition of components within reporting units  could in the future require a reduction of goodwill and recognition of related non cash impairment charges 
if we were required to further impair our store assets or our goodwill  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
provisions in our stockholder rights plan may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  our company or a large block of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations overview our business is comprised of three segments 
the north american retail division includes our retail stores in the us which offer office supplies and services  computers and business machines and related supplies  and office furniture 
most stores also have a copy and print center offering printing  reproduction  mailing and shipping 
the north american business solutions division sells office supply products and services in the us and canada directly to businesses through catalogs  internet web sites and a dedicated sales force 
our international division sells office products and services through catalogs  internet web sites  a dedicated sales force and retail stores in europe and asia 
our fiscal year results are based on a or week retail calendar ending on the last saturday in december 
fiscal year is based on weeks  with a week fourth quarter 
fiscal years and include weeks 
our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year 
stores are removed from the comparable sales calculation during remodeling and if significantly downsized 
a summary of factors important to understanding our results for is provided below 
the comparisons to prior years are discussed in the narrative that follows this overview 
total company sales were billion in  down compared to the rd week added approximately million of sales in total company sales decreased in compared to sales for compared to declined in the north american retail division and in the north american business solutions division 
comparable store sales in the north american retail division decreased in international division sales decreased in us dollars and in constant currencies 
gross margin for improved approximately basis points compared to  following a basis point increase from the increase in primarily reflects improvement from reduced promotional activity  lower property costs and changes in the mix of sales channels and products sold 
we recognized charges of approximately million in  primarily related to restructuring related activity in the international division and restructuring and process improvement actions at the corporate level 
charges recognized in and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
non cash asset impairment charges of million were recorded in  with million recognized in the north american retail division and million recognized in the international division 
refer to the retail strategy discussion below for additional information 
we also settled a dispute related to a acquisition which resulted in a gain of million being recognized in as recovery of purchase price 
a related expense of million was reported in general and administrative expenses 
cash received from this settlement was contributed to the acquired pension plan  resulting in the plan being in a net funded position of approximately million at december  the effective tax rate for was negative  reflecting the impact of valuation allowances in the us and certain international jurisdictions  as well as the non taxable recovery of purchase price and a benefit recognized from an approved tax loss carryback 
tax and related interest benefits of approximately million were recognized in from the reversal of uncertain tax position accruals and the release of valuation allowances 
because of the valuation allowances  the company continues to experience significant effective tax rate volatility within the year and across years 
at the end of  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million available on our asset based credit facility 
cash flow from operating activities was million for 
table of contents operating results discussion of additional income and expense items  including material charges and credits and changes in interest and taxes follows our review of segment results 
we are currently evaluating changes to the measurement of division operating income in our management reporting 
under this consideration  which may be implemented in  a significant amount of costs currently managed at the corporate level could be allocated to the divisions and certain allocation methodologies updated 
when the analysis is compete  prior period reported information may be recast for comparison  using updated allocations to prior periods where appropriate 
north american retail division in millions sales change division operating income of sales sales in our north american retail division decreased in  in and in fiscal year included a rd week based on our retail calendar  compared to weeks in and this additional week added approximately million of sales in fiscal year the decline in total sales in and reflects the closing of and stores  respectively 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased  with the fourth quarter down compared to the prior year 
transaction counts were lower in both and  consistent with the comparable store sales declines 
sales in copy and print depot increased in both and  while sales of technology products  technology peripheral items  furniture and some office supplies declined in both periods 
our decision to reduce promotions in select categories contributed to lower sales in both and the north american retail division reported operating income of approximately million in  million in and million in division operating income in included approximately million of asset impairment charges  compared to million in and million in additional information on the impairment charge is provided in the retail strategy discussion below 
division operating income for included approximately million of severance and other charges  while included approximately million of charges associated with the closure of stores in canada 
gross margins increased in both and from lower promotional activity and a change in the mix of sales away from technology products  as well as continuing benefits from lower occupancy costs 
operating expenses in included lower supply chain costs and lower payroll and variable pay 
operating expenses in included severance and other costs associated with the store closures in canada  higher variable based pay and incremental costs incurred to drive increased customer focused selling activities 
these costs were offset by a positive contribution from the rd week in  decreased advertising expenses and other favorable items including benefits recognized from changes to our private label credit card program 
division operating income in all periods was negatively affected by the impact our sales volume decline had on gross margin and operating expenses the flow through impact 
at the end of  we operated  retail stores in the us we opened new stores during and stores during we closed stores in north america during we closed stores in north america during  including the stores in canada 

table of contents retail strategy as consumers have shifted their buying patterns  we have been developing new store formats to satisfy changing customer needs and shopping behavior 
we now have almost stores in small to mid sized store formats 
the inventory selections in these stores are the higher volume items that customers seek and the stores provide for an expanded services offering 
at the stores  customers also have the ability to order our inventory products from our web site 
we continue to make modifications to these prototypes 
during  the north american retail division conducted a review of each store location and developed a revised retail strategy the na retail strategy 
approximately of the stores in our portfolio have leases that will be at an optional renewal period within the next three years and within the next five years 
each location was reviewed for a decision to retain as currently configured and located  downsize to either small or mid size format  relocate  remodel  or close at the end of the base lease term 
the result of this analysis is a plan to downsize approximately locations to small format stores at the end of their current lease term over the next three years and an additional locations over the following two years 
approximately locations will be down sized or relocated to the mid sized format over three years and another over the following two years 
we anticipate closing approximately stores as their base lease period ends 
the remaining stores in the portfolio are anticipated to remain as configured  be remodeled or have base lease periods more than five years in the future 
future market conditions may impact any of the decisions used in this analysis 
downsizing and closing stores likely will result in lower reported sales in future periods 
downsized locations will be removed from the comparable store sales calculation until the one year comparable period is reached at the new store size 
the na retail strategy includes anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million per year for the next five years 
these decisions to modify the store portfolio have impacted our store impairment analysis which is prepared at an individual store level 
the cash flow time horizon for stores expected to be closed  relocated or downsized has been reduced to the base lease period  eliminating renewal option periods from the calculation  where applicable 
the current outlook on sales is a decline of in the first year 
the projected sales continue to be negative for the second year  but are on an improving trend 
this trend reflects our view that a portion of the sales previously made in our retail locations may be migrating to our online and other channels  but because those sales are not fulfilled out of the retail store  they are not considered cash flow sources in this impairment analysis 
gross margin assumptions have been held constant at our current actual levels and we have assumed operating costs consistent with recent actual results and planned activities 
in addition to the impact of our real estate strategy on asset impairments  certain remaining assets will now be depreciated over a shorter period of time 
we anticipate incremental accelerated depreciation of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
because the na retail strategy is based on taking actions at the end of the location s lease term  we do not expect significant closed store lease accruals 
however  we do anticipate volatility in results in future periods as certain accounting criteria are met 
for example  certain locations with some level of impairment are facilities accounted for as capital leases 
we no longer expect to stay in the location beyond the base lease period but accounting rules limit the reconsideration of the capital lease term in periods prior to a formal lease modification 
this current period impairment charge related to these leased assets will be followed by a credit to income in a future period from release of the accrued capital lease obligations when the option periods are not exercised and the leases are terminated 
additionally  operating leases with scheduled rent increases result in higher expense and establishment of a deferred rent credit in early years that is reversed in later years  resulting in a straight line rent expense 
if a location closes or relocates at the end of the base lease term  this credit will be released to income at that time 
deferred rent credits for renegotiated lease arrangements with the existing landlord will be amortized over the new lease period 

table of contents to the extent that forward looking sales and operating assumptions in the current portfolio are not achieved and are subsequently reduced  or more stores are closed  additional impairment charges may result 
of the stores with some level of impairment recognized in  approximately have remaining asset values of approximately million that will be depreciated over their shortened estimated useful lives 
these and other lower performing locations are particularly sensitive to changes in projected cash flows over this period and additional impairment is possible in future periods if results are below projections 
store performance lower than current projections may also result in additional quarterly asset impairment charges 
however  at the end of  the impairment analysis reflects the company s best estimate of future performance  including the intended future use of the company s retail stores 
north american business solutions division in millions sales change division operating income of sales sales in our north american business solutions division decreased in  in and in the rd week added approximately million of sales to the division in total sales in both the direct and contract channels decreased slightly in after considering the rd week in direct channel sales increased in  while contract sales were lower compared to sales to large and global accounts increased in both and however  sales to state and local government accounts decreased in both periods reflecting continuation of budgetary pressures

division operating income totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase in division operating income reflects gross margin benefits from reduced promotions and margin improvement initiatives  as well as lower supply chain  advertising and other costs  partially offset by certain severance and process improvement costs 
the increase in reflects the impact of a change in the mix of product sales to the direct channel  lower operating expenses  a change of mix of customers in the contract channel  and positive impacts from our margin improvement initiatives

as a result of slowing economic conditions in sweden and certain integration difficulties  in the third quarter of  we re evaluated remaining balances of acquisition related intangible assets 
based on this analysis  which included a decline in projected sales and profitability for this acquired business  we concluded that cash flows would be insufficient to recover the assets over their expected use period 
the charges primarily related to severance and other costs associated with facility closures and streamlining processes 
the decreases in division operating income in  and were impacted by the flow through impact of lower sales levels 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased in and increased in the decrease in primarily reflects a shift in the mix of sales away from the direct channel

recovery of purchase price the sale and purchase agreement spa associated with a european acquisition included a provision whereby the seller was required to pay an amount to the company if a specified acquired pension plan was calculated to be underfunded based on plan data

charges in and the charges primarily relate to the consolidation and elimination of functions in europe  the closure of stores in canada and company wide process improvement initiatives 
in the consolidated statements of operations  for comparability to the presentation  we have reclassified million related to store level impairment to asset impairments line  which was previously reported in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  those asset impairment charges have not been reflected in the table above 

table of contents the charges in include million for the abandonment of a certain software application  million for losses on the disposal of operating entities in israel and japan  as well as million of compensation related costs following the departure of the company s former ceo

table of contents interest expense was impacted by the reversal of accrued interest of million in and million in following settlements of uncertain tax positions 
our accounting policy is to present interest accruals and reversals on uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense 
additionally  approximately million of interest income was recognized in from one of the tax settlements 
on march   we completed a cash tender offer to purchase up to million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the total consideration for each  note surrendered was

these results also were impacted by foreign currency and other gains and losses in all periods 
income taxes in millions income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings loss before income taxes 
the negative effective tax rate for results from recognizing tax expense in jurisdictions with pre tax income while being precluded from recognizing deferred tax benefits on pre tax losses in the us and certain international jurisdictions that are subject to valuation allowances 
additionally  the pension settlement was a non taxable transaction and the full year tax rate includes a net million tax benefit from an approved tax loss carryback 
the effective rate also reflects the impact on deferred tax asset from a tax rate change in an international jurisdiction 
the effective tax rates for and reflect benefits from settlements of uncertain tax positions utps and from the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
the rate includes the reversal of million of utp accruals following closure of tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations on previously open tax years 
the effective rate includes the reversal of approximately million of utp accruals 
in addition  and include approximately million and million  respectively  of discrete benefits from the release of valuation allowances in certain european countries because of improved performance in those jurisdictions 
partially offsetting these tax benefits is income tax expense recognized for taxpaying entities 
because of significant valuation allowances that remain in other jurisdictions  deferred tax benefits are not recognized on certain loss generating entities 
within our international operations  statutory tax expense is generally lower compared to the aggregate us federal and state income tax rates 
this is further impacted by favorable tax ruling within our international operations 
the aggregate reversal of utps in was reduced by approximately million which was offset against other tax related accounts and had no impact on earnings 
the utp reversals also resulted in a reversal of previously accrued interest expense of million in and million in  as well as recognition of million of interest income in our accounting policy is to include accrued interest on utps  and any related reversals  as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents following the recognition of significant valuation allowances in  we have regularly experienced substantial volatility in our effective tax rate for interim periods 
because deferred income tax benefits cannot be recognized in several jurisdictions  changes in the amount  mix and timing of projected pre tax earnings in tax paying jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the annual expected tax rate which  applied against year to date results  can result in significant volatility in the overall effective tax rate 
this interim and full year volatility is likely to continue in future periods until the valuation allowances can be released 
we have reached a tentative settlement with the us internal revenue service irs appeals division to close the previously disclosed irs deemed royalty assessment relating to and foreign operations 
the settlement is subject to the congressional joint committee on taxation approval which is anticipated in the resolution of this deemed royalty assessment will close all known disputes relating to and however  pending this approval  the irs has made a deemed royalty assessment of million million tax effected relating to foreign operations 
we disagree with this assessment and believe no utp accrual is required at this time 
we file a us federal income tax return and other income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions 
the us federal tax returns for and are under review 
significant international tax jurisdictions include the uk  the netherlands  france and germany 
generally  we are subject to routine examination for years and forward in these foreign jurisdictions 
it is reasonably possible that some audits will close within the next twelve months which we do not believe would result in a change to our accrued uncertain tax positions

in addition to the above  we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a of the consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements inventory purchases from vendors are generally under arrangements that automatically renew until cancelled with periodic updates or annual negotiated agreements 
many of these arrangements require the vendors to make payments to us or provide credits to be used against purchases if and when certain conditions are met 
we refer to these arrangements as vendor programs 
vendor programs fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the first category is volume based rebates 
under those arrangements  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
certain of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined tier  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a basis for our estimates of purchase volume 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief at any point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
in recent years  we have reduced the number of arrangements that contain this tiered purchase rebate mechanism in exchange for a lower product cost throughout the year 
continued elimination of tiered arrangements could further reduce the potential variability in gross margin from changes in volume based estimates 

table of contents the second broad category of arrangements with our vendors is event based programs 
these arrangements can take many forms  including advertising support  special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  and various other special programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  based on the nature of the program and the sell through of the inventory 
some arrangements may meet the specific  incremental  identifiable cost criteria that allow for direct operating expense offset  but such arrangements are not significant 
vendor programs are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates and amounts due from vendors are generally settled throughout the year based on purchase volumes 
the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are settled within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historical collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we monitor active inventory for excessive quantities and slow moving items and record adjustments as necessary to lower the value if the anticipated realizable amount is below cost 
we also identify merchandise that we plan to discontinue or have begun to phase out and assess the estimated recoverability of the carrying value 
this includes consideration of the quantity of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of current and projected market conditions and anticipated vendor programs 
if necessary  we record a charge to cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of this merchandise to our estimate of the lower of cost or realizable amount 
additional promotional activities may be initiated and markdowns may be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
we also recognize an expense in cost of sales for our estimate of physical inventory loss from theft  short shipment and other factors referred to as inventory shrink 
during the year  we adjust the estimate of our inventory shrink rate accrual following on hand adjustments and our physical inventory count results 
these changes in estimates may result in volatility within the year or impact comparisons to other periods 
asset impairments store assets are reviewed quarterly for recoverability of their asset carrying amounts 
the analysis uses input from retail store operations and the company s accounting and finance personnel that organizationally report to the chief financial officer 
these projections are based on management s estimates of store level sales  gross margins  direct expenses  exercise of future lease renewal options  where applicable  and resulting cash flows and  by their nature  include judgments about how current initiatives will impact future performance 
if the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying value of its assets  the assets are written down to estimated fair value using level inputs 
store asset impairment charges of million and million for and  respectively  are in asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
these charges are measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value  typically calculated as the discounted amount of the estimated cash flow  including estimated salvage value 
important assumptions used in these projections include an assessment of future overall economic conditions  our ability to control future costs  maintain aspects of positive performance  and successfully implement initiatives designed to enhance sales and gross margins 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
unless individual store performance improves  future impairment charges may result 

table of contents closed store accruals we regularly assess the performance of each retail store against historical patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales levels  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain operating performance targets  we may decide to close the store prior to the end of its lease term 
at the point of closure  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
lease commitments with no economic benefit to the company are discounted at the credit adjusted discount rate at the time of each location closure 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
generally  costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the year  or sooner if indicators of potential impairment are identified 
for  we have elected to quantitatively test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
this test compares the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flow and certain market value data 
fair value of the indefinite lived trade name is obtained using a discounted cash flow analysis 
these fair value methods require significant judgment assumptions and estimates  including industry economic factors and future profitability 
the discounted cash flow analysis for goodwill testing begins with the ensuing year s business plan and requires estimates of future sales  profitability  capital expenditures and related cash flows 
we include a residual value and discount the aggregate cash flow at an estimated cost of capital for the related unit 
we also review the results against a measurement of market capitalization and  to the extent available  market data 
of the goodwill recognized at december   approximately million was in the international division s european reporting unit and million was in the north american business solutions division s direct reporting unit 
the european reporting unit has the greatest sensitivity to potential changes in economic conditions  company performance and the related impacts on estimated fair value 
this reporting unit is comprised of wholly owned entities and ownership of the joint venture in mexico 
at december   the fair value estimate of the reporting unit  including assumed control premiums  exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
a significant portion of this excess is associated with the joint venture operations in mexico 
if the joint venture were to be removed from the composition of the reporting unit  it is likely that all of the existing goodwill would be impaired 
additionally  even if there is no change in the composition of the reporting unit  if future performance is below our projections  goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges can result 
the estimated fair value of the direct reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in our tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the realization of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
because of the downturn in our performance in recent years  as well as the restructuring activities and charges we have taken in response  we established significant valuation allowances during a portion of those valuation allowances were offset in when we recorded deferred tax liabilities related to removing the permanent reinvestment assumption of certain foreign investments 
valuation allowances remain in certain foreign jurisdictions 
judgment is required in projecting when operations will be sufficiently positive to allow a conclusion that utilization of the deferred tax assets will once again be more likely than not 
positive performance in subsequent periods and projections of future positive performance will need to be evaluated against existing negative evidence 
valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions were removed during and because sufficient positive financial information existed  resulting in tax benefit recognition of million and million  respectively 
in  additional valuation allowances were established in certain foreign jurisdictions because realizability of the related deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not 
our effective tax rate in future periods may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in related judgments about valuation allowances or pre tax operations 

table of contents in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update that estimate quarterly  with the cumulative effect of a change in the anticipated annual rate reflected in the tax provision of that period 
such changes can result in significant interim reporting volatility 
this volatility can result from changes in our projected earnings levels  the mix of income  the impact of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions and the interim accounting rules applied to entities expected to pay taxes on a full year basis  but recognizing losses in an interim period 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities  may lead us to conclude that an accrual for an uncertain tax position utp is required 
we generally maintain accruals for utps until examination of the tax position is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
during the third quarter of  following closure of certain tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations on previously open tax years  we reversed approximately million of utps and a related million of accrued interest 
an additional utp accrual of million was reversed during the fourth quarter of following closure of certain tax audits 
matters could arise in the future that could result in additional tax and interest expense or utp accruals 
further  the company has significant operations outside the us during  us deferred taxes were provided on one foreign investment because repatriation of accumulated earnings was at least possible 
however  no incremental us deferred taxes have been provided on the remaining foreign operations because earnings from those entities have been and will continue to be reinvested into the foreign operations 
should we decide to distribute earnings from our foreign operations to the us  additional income tax expense would be recognized  or valuation allowances reduced  for the income tax consequence of the anticipated distribution and possibly for the calculated tax consequences of the full amount of undistributed earnings  net of allowable offsets 
preferred stock paid in kind dividends our redeemable preferred stock carries a stated dividend of  subject to future decreases in certain circumstances  and allows for payment in cash or an increase in the preferred stock s liquidation preference as directed by the board of directors 
the valuation for accounting purposes of the dividend paid in kind requires significant judgment to determine the estimated fair value 
we have used a binomial simulation model to measure values of multiple possible outcomes of the various provisions in the agreement that could impact whether the dividend rate would change based on future stock price performance  whether the company would issue a notice to call the preferred shares and whether the holders would convert their preferred stock into common stock 
while the fair value of preferred stock dividends paid in kind has no standing in the contractual rights to liquidation preference of the preferred shareholders nor any cash impact on the company  it impacts the measurement of net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share 
changes in the valuation assumptions such as the risk adjusted rate  stock price volatility and time to call or convert can impact the estimated fair value and therefore the amount reported as net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share 
however  the valuation is most sensitive to changes in the underlying common stock price 
we believe the model used to estimate fair value is reasonable and appropriate  but the reported dividend amount could change significantly in future periods based on changes in the underlying common stock price and the model inputs 
the board of directors decided to pay the dividend in kind for the first three quarters of and in cash for the fourth quarter amount due in january dividends are expected to be paid in cash during  though the board of directors assesses available data quarterly before making that decision 

table of contents significant trends  developments and uncertainties competitive factors over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
warehouse clubs have expanded beyond their in store assortment by adding catalogs and web sites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered 
we also face competition from other office supply stores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them also feature technology products 
many of them may price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry that could shift purchasing away from office supply specialty retailers and adversely impact our results 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry that could impact our results 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
economic factors our customers in the north american retail division and the international division and many of our customers in the north american business solutions division are predominantly small and home office businesses 
accordingly  spending by these customers is affected by macroeconomic conditions  such as changes in the housing market and commodity costs  credit availability and other factors 
the downturn in the global economy experienced in recent years negatively impacted our sales and profits 
liquidity factors historically  we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business 
together  these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs  as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings  capital improvements and acquisitions 
due to the downturn in the global economy  our operating results have declined 
we have in place an asset based credit facility to provide liquidity  subject to availability as specified in the agreement 
further deterioration in our financial results could negatively impact our credit ratings  our liquidity and our access to the capital markets 
certain of our existing indebtedness matures in and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness 
if we are able to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness  the terms of such refinancing will likely be less favorable than the terms of our existing indebtedness  which would increase future interest expense 

table of contents market sensitive risks and positions we have adopted an enterprise risk management process patterned after the principles set out by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso in management utilizes a common view of exposure identification and risk management 
a process is in place for periodic risk reviews and identification of appropriate mitigation strategies 
we have market risk exposure related to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodities 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate changes on obligations may result from external market factors  as well as changes in our credit rating 
we manage our exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates  foreign currency rates  or commodities is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash  cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at december  from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of less than million 
market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below in thousands carrying value fair value risk sensitivity carrying value fair value risk sensitivity senior notes senior secured notes asset based credit facility the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business through entities in various countries outside the united states where their functional currency is not the us dollar 
while we sell directly or indirectly to customers in countries  the principal operations of our international division are in countries with euro  british pound and mexican peso functional currencies 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our pretax earnings of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we also are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
at december   there was million of foreign exchange forward contracts hedging inventory exposures 
this amount was the highest amount outstanding at any point during also  from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward transactions to protect against possible changes in exchange rates related to scheduled or anticipated cash movements among our operating entities

commodities risk we operate a large network of stores and delivery centers around the world 
as such  we purchase significant amounts of fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers as well as pay shipping costs to import products from overseas 
we are exposed to potential changes in the underlying commodity costs associated with this transport activity 
as of december   a change in domestic commodity costs would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be somewhat seasonal  with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter  following the back to business sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the back to school sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter

including the above  there are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the financial accounting standards board has issued proposed accounting rules relating to leasing transactions that  if passed in their current form  would have significant impacts to our financial statements 
among other things  the current proposal would create a right of use asset and corresponding liability on the balance sheet measured at the present value of lease payments 
a lessee would use the effective interest method to subsequently measure the liability and the right of use asset would be amortized based on one of two approaches determined by the nature of the underlying asset 
these proposed changes in accounting rules would have no direct economic impact to the company
