item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth above under the caption risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes appearing in part ii item of this report 
overview we are a medical device company focused on the commercialization of our flagship product  melafind  and the further design and development of melafind and our technology 
melafind is a non invasive  point of care instrument to aid in the detection of melanoma 
melafind  features a hand held component that emits multiple wavelengths of light to capture digital data from clinically atypical pigmented skin lesions 
prior to the commercial launch of melafind commencing in the first quarter of  the company had not generated any revenues from melafind 
all of our historical revenues have come from activities and products that have since been discontinued 
in november  the company received written approval from the fda for the melafind pma application and in september received ce mark approval for melafind 
on march   the company installed the first commercial melafind systems  and proceeded with the first phase of the commercial launch of its breakthrough product for melanoma detection 
in the company evolved from a research and development company to a commercial enterprise 
the first commercial melafind systems were placed in working office settings to obtain critical market feedback from dermatologists and their patients 
the company utilized this information to adapt the melafind interface and to make system enhancements to optimize the user experience  accordingly 
the market feedback from the initial installations was also used to determine the optimal medical messaging to dermatologists and in patient directed materials in order to effectively communicate the features and benefits of melafind 
the training program for dermatologists  required as part of the fda approval of melafind  was put into practice at launch 
the training of the dermatologists and their staffs includes the appropriate use of melafind and how best to integrate melafind into their practices  protocols and algorithms for melanoma detection 
during  the company put in place and developed several critical capabilities to support its commercialization goals 
included among these added capabilities were sales and marketing leadership and staff  technical support and field installation resources  implementation of crm customer resource management and erp enterprise resource planning business systems  and expanded and optimized manufacturing processes with the company s critical business partners 
the initial launch of melafind was controlled and deliberate  focused primarily on the us northeast  and several select cities in germany 
midway through  the scope was widened beyond these select cities and at december   we had over signed user agreements with our customers throughout the us and germany 
management estimates that this phase of the commercial launch will be complete when approximately user agreements are signed roughly in the us and in germany 
the second phase of the melafind launch will focus primarily on driving melafind utilization 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will depend on the success of commercialization of melafind  and may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
our operating expenses may also vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter in support of the commercialization of melafind 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of our future performance 

table of contents we commenced operations in december as a new york corporation and re incorporated as a delaware corporation in september since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the commercialization of melafind 
subsequent to year end  we raised approximately million in net proceeds comprised of approximately million under our at the market equity offering program and approximately million from a public offering of our common stock 
in addition  in february the company signed a term sheet to borrow up to million  of which million will be immediately available to the company upon closing 
the loan is subject to satisfactory completion of the lender s due diligence and the execution of definitive loan documents 
there can be no assurance that the loan will be consummated or that the material terms of the loan will be as described 
we believe that our year end cash and cash equivalents  combined with our financing activities subsequent to year end and anticipated revenues  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated levels of operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  should the company experience unforeseen expenses  or if anticipated revenues are not realized  the effect could negatively impact management s estimated operating results over the next twelve months 
the timing and amount of any additional funding the company may require to broaden the commercialization of melafind will be affected by the commercial success of the product 
the funding could be in the form of either additional equity or debt financing 
in the event that the company is unable to raise additional funds  the company has the ability and intent to reduce certain discretionary expenditures 
most of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product development  clinical trials and activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
our research and development expenses incurred for the year ended december  were related primarily to the development of melafind 
we expect to continue to incur certain additional research and development expenses relating to melafind 
additional research and development charges may be incurred for complementary technologies 
these additional expenses could exceed our estimated amounts  possibly materially 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related human resources expenses  legal expenses  general corporate activities and costs associated with our efforts to expand our commercial infrastructure to market and sell melafind 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to build our sales and marketing capabilities to support placing melafind systems in selected markets inside and outside the us at december   we had available income tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards may be available to offset future taxable income expiring at various dates through the year the company s ability to utilize its net operating losses may be significantly limited due to future changes in the company s ownership as defined by federal income tax regulations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an 
table of contents ongoing basis  we evaluate our judgments related to accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates relating to revenue recognition  stock based compensation charges  and accrued expenses are most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition the company considers revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s agreements with dermatologists regarding the melafind system combine the elements noted above with a future service obligation 
while the company is required to place the melafind systems with dermatologists for their exclusive use  ownership of the melafind systems remains with the company 
in the us  the company generates revenue generally from the sale of electronic patient record cards 
these cards activate the melafind system  capture data and store the data for each patient visit 
in january  the company began offering two additional billing options 
customers now choose among three billing options purchase of single use electronic cards use of high capacity activation cards which allow for billing electronically per session or per lesion  or a fixed monthly rental fee 
additionally  the company typically charges an initial installation fee for each melafind system  which covers training  delivery  supplies  maintenance and the right to use melafind 
in accordance with the accounting guidance regarding multiple element arrangements  the company allocates total contract consideration to each element based upon the relative standalone selling prices of each element  and recognizes the associated revenue for each element as delivery occurs or over the related service period  generally expected to be two years 
costs of revenue are associated with the placement of the melafind system in the doctor s office  the cost of consumables delivered at installation  the cost of the electronic record cards  technical support costs and costs of the melafind system placed with the customer  which remains the property of the company 
certain product quality and manufacturing overhead costs associated with supporting the contract manufacturers of melafind are allocated to costs of goods sold and melafind systems on hand 
in germany  the typical contract with dermatologists calls for an installation fee and or fixed monthly fee and a per patient usage charge 
revenue generated from german contracts is recognized when earned 
prior to the installation of the first commercial melafind system in the first quarter of  the company had no revenues from products since when it discontinued its difoti operations 
stock based compensation we account for non employee stock based awards in which goods or services are the consideration received for the equity instruments issued based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued in accordance with fasb asc  equity based payments to non employees 
we record compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
a compensation charge is recorded  when it is probable that performance conditions will be satisfied  over the period estimated to satisfy the performance condition 
the probability of vesting is updated at each reporting period and compensation is adjusted prospectively 

table of contents accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include professional service fees  contract clinical and regulatory related service fees  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of melafind components or materials  and fees paid to third party data collection organizations and investigators in conjunction with the clinical trials and fda and other regulatory review 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our projections of the timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services provided by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us and accrue for such costs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
this is done as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  in the year ended december   the company evolved from being exclusively a research and development company prior to the melafind launch to a commercial company with the controlled installation of melafind systems in the us and germany 
additions have been made to the direct sales force and field technical support capabilities of the company commensurate with these additional installations and the increasing demand for melafind 
the production levels of our contract manufacturers have been increased to address the growing demand for melafind systems 
for the first two months of the company continued to record all transactions as an r d company  as it had in subsequent to the commercial launch of melafind  certain costs previously classified as research and development expenses are now classified as cost of revenue  inventory or selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing efforts were increased in prior and subsequent to the commercial launch of melafind 
revenue invoicing in the year ended december  totaled  with revenue of and deferred revenue of recorded as the company continued its controlled commercial launch of the melafind product  which commenced during march prior to the commercial launch of melafind  the company had not recorded any product revenue or deferred revenue since the discontinuance of its difoti product in in general  the company signs a user agreement with its customers that includes an installation fee for the placement of the melafind system and provides for the sale of its electronic patient record cards and consumables  which are needed to operate the system  or a fixed monthly rental fee 
the company is addressing unique aspects of the european marketplace through variations of the user agreement 
deferred revenue primarily reflects the timed recognition of the installation fee revenue over the term of the user agreement  which is generally two years 

table of contents cost of revenue costs of  were recorded as associated with the realization of melafind revenue during the year ended december  these costs were made up of direct costs associated with the placement of the melafind system in the doctor s office  the cost of consumables delivered at installation  the cost of the electronic record cards  technical support costs and depreciation expense of the melafind system placed with the customer  which remains the property of the company 
certain product quality and manufacturing overhead costs associated with supporting the contract manufacturers of melafind are allocated to costs of goods sold and product inventory 
the company had not recorded any cost of revenue prior to the commercial launch of melafind 
research and development expense research and development r d expenses decreased  or for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable period a year earlier 
in  of regulatory expenses and of clinical expenses  which prior to commercialization would have been recorded to r d  were recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
also  of technical support expenses  of certain quality expenses  and of certain operating expenses  which prior to commercialization would have been recorded to r d  were recorded to cost of revenue or inventory 
exclusive of these changes  r d expenses increased over the comparable period of this increase was principally made up of the increases in software development costs of and in us development expenses of offset by a decrease in askion development costs of  in compared to selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased  or for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable period a year earlier

as kavo has not re launched difoti as of year end  the company earned the minimum annual royalty of in both and liquidity and capital resources in thousands from inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the use of working capital from the sale of equity securities

subsequent to year end  the company signed a term sheet for a debt instrument in the amount of million  million of which is available immediately upon closing and million of which will be available based on certain future milestones

cash flows from investing activities net cash used in our investing activities was  for the year ended december  principally relating to the purchase of fixed assets generally melafind systems 
for the year ended december  net cash used by investing activities was principally relating to the purchase of fixed assets 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  and reflects the net proceeds received from our atm program sale of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
for the year ended december   the net cash flows provided by financing activities was  which reflects the net proceeds received from our december  public offering of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we face certain risks and uncertainties  which are present in many emerging medical device companies 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we proceed with the melafind commercialization process and expand our corporate infrastructure 
we do not expect to generate significant product revenue until after we successfully complete a controlled product launch of melafind 
however  we will need substantial funds to broaden the commercialization of melafind  including development of a direct sales force and expansion of our contract manufacturing capacity 
the timing and amount of any additional funding the company may require will be affected by the commercial success of the product 
the funding could be in the form of either additional equity or debt financing 
subsequent to year end  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from a 
table of contents public offering of our common stock and from sales under our at the market equity offering program and signed a term sheet to borrow up to million  of which million will be immediately available to the company upon closing 
the loan is subject to satisfactory completion of the lender s due diligence and the execution of definitive loan documents 
there can be no assurance that the loan will be consummated or that the material terms of the loan will be as described 
we believe that our year end cash and cash equivalents  combined with our financing activities subsequent to year end and anticipated revenues  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated levels of operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  should the company experience unforeseen expenses  or if anticipated revenues are not realized  the effect could negatively impact management s estimated operating results over the next twelve months 
if our existing cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility  which will be even more difficult due to the lack of available capital as a result of the ongoing effects of the recent global economic crisis 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities would have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of planned product research development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of medical devices such as melafind and operating our company  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing and building a domestic direct sales force and conducting activities in germany and ultimately in other countries  the amount of direct payments we are able to obtain from physicians utilizing melafind  the costs of maintaining regulatory approval  reimbursement amounts for the use of melafind that we are able to obtain from medicare and third party payers  the success of our research and development efforts in product creation and enhancement  and meeting competitive services and technologies  the schedule  costs  and results of our clinical trials  the costs of maintaining or potentially building our inventory and other manufacturing expenses  our ability to establish and maintain any collaborative  licensing or other arrangements  and the terms and timing of any such arrangements 
the costs involved in defending any patent infringement actions or other litigation claims brought against us by third parties  and the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims or other rights

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts

recently adopted accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued a number of new accounting standards that require future adoption 
based on the company s initial review of these new standards  none are expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk at december  is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest in cash and money market accounts with commercial banks 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
while declines in interest rates do impact the amount of interest income that our cash and cash equivalents will earn  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments  due to the nature of our accounts
