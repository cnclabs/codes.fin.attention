current economic environment while we signed a number of new customer contracts in  many of our customers remained cautious with the uncertainty caused by the european sovereign debt crisis  persistent high unemployment rate and slow economic growth 
this caution slowed buying decisions and elongated some sales 
the conversion of our sales pipeline to new contract bookings  renewal rates and cash collections was lower than expected during  especially in europe and the middle east  and we 
table of contents expect this environment may continue in despite this  we grew our revenues in compared to  which was driven primarily by an increase in term license revenues and other recurring revenues 
we expect to grow revenues by to in fiscal as a result of incremental term license booking activity 
we implemented a re organization plan in the fourth quarter of to align strategy and function  reduce operating costs and improve profitability 
as a result of this action  we expect annual operating expense run rate savings of approximately million 
as the current economic situation evolves  we will continue to evaluate its impact on our business and we will remain focused on increasing operating profit and margin 
financial overview financial highlights of and  and associated dollar and percentage fluctuations were as follows in thousands  except per share amounts  percentages and margin changes fiscal years percentage margin change net revenues gross margin gross margin percentage operating income operating margin percentage net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations per diluted share operating cash flows revenues and gross margin in increased from the layering of new term license contracts and growth in our product revenues from black diamond which was acquired in june operating income in grew faster than revenue resulting from improved operating leverage 
net income from continuing operations in increased at a lower rate than operating income due principally to higher effective income tax rates in than net income per share in increased faster than net income as a result of the reduction of weighted average shares outstanding due to recent common share repurchases activity 
operating cash flows increased modestly in as a result of increased profitability  partially offset by payments for income taxes 
term license and term license deferral term license revenues now comprise substantially all of our license revenues 
when a customer purchases a term license together with implementation services  we do not recognize any revenue under the contract until the implementation services are substantially complete 
if the implementation services are still in progress as of quarter end  we will defer all of the contract revenues to a subsequent quarter 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
the term license component of the deferred revenue balance related to implementations in process will increase or decrease in the future depending on the amount of new term license bookings relative to the number of implementations that reach completion in a particular quarter 

table of contents during and  changes in the net term license component of deferred revenues increased decreased the company revenues as follows in millions fiscal years change term license revenues professional services and other total net revenues during  we recognized net revenues of million and deferred directly related expenses of million associated with our term licensing model  resulting in an increase in our operating income of approximately million 
amounts of revenues and directly related expenses deferred as of december  and associated with our term licensing deferral were as follows in millions december deferred revenues short term long term total directly related expenses short term long term total deferred net revenues and directly related expenses are classified as deferred revenues short term and long term  and prepaid expenses and other  and other assets  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
non gaap financial measures and other operational data we consider certain operating measures  such as the annual contract value acv of term license  black diamond and advent ondemand contracts and renewal rates  and certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  including non gaap net income  non gaap net income per share and free cash flow  in measuring the performance of our business 
the non gaap measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
however  we believe that this non gaap information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate our operating performance  when reviewed in conjunction with our gaap financial statements 
therefore  these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and because these amounts are not determined in accordance with gaap  they should not be used exclusively in evaluating our business and operations 
in addition  undue reliance should not be placed upon non gaap or operating information because this information is neither standardized across companies nor subjected to the same control activities and audit procedures that produce our gaap financial results

average term is weighted by contract value for all new term licenses  black diamond and advent ondemand contracts signed in the period 
the slight decrease in bookings in is primarily due to a decrease in bookings from the europe  middle east and africa emea region in as compared to renewal rates our renewal rates are based on cash collections and are disclosed one quarter in arrears 
we disclose our renewal rates one quarter in arrears in order to include substantially all payments received against the invoices for that quarter 
we also update our renewal rates from the initially disclosed rates to include all cash collections subsequent to the initial disclosure 
we experience seasonality in our bookings and renewals 
we believe that this seasonality results from customer budgeting cycles and expect it will continue in the future 
as a result  the fourth quarter of the year typically has more 
table of contents bookings and renewal activity  followed by lower activity in the first quarter of the following year

the renewal rate in the second quarter of was negatively impacted by points due to three emea customers ceasing business  deactivating or reducing use of our products 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share non gaap net income is calculated by adjusting gaap net income for the provision for income taxes  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangibles  restructuring charges  acquisition related charges and other non recurring items 
non gaap net income per share is calculated by dividing non gaap net income by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period

the estimated non gaap effective tax rate was for fiscal  and  respectively  and has been used to adjust the provision for income taxes for non gaap purposes 
the growth in non gaap net income and net income per share since reflects improved operating leverage in our business as we have grown revenues at a faster pace than our variable costs 
free cash flow free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less cash used for purchases of property and equipment  and capitalized software development costs 
free cash flow  and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable gaap measure of operating cash flow  for fiscal  and was as follows in thousands fiscal years cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment capitalized software development costs free cash flow the fluctuations in free cash flow during these periods primarily reflected our capital expenditure activity 
we built out our new office facilities in new york city and boston during  beijing  sweden and london in  and jacksonville  florida in critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in 
table of contents accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the process we use to develop estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other information that we believe is reasonable for making judgments at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenues  income taxes  stock based compensation  restructuring charges and related accruals  business combinations  disposition  goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  legal contingencies  and sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
revenue recognition and deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue from term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues  perpetual license fees  professional services and other 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
software license fees 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor customers 
revenue is recognized once delivery to the distributor customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs upon notification that software is available for electronic download through our fulfillment vendor  or when a product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point  or upon confirmation that product delivered fob shipping destination has been received 
some of our arrangements include acceptance provisions  if such acceptance provisions are present  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectability of the resulting receivable is probable based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through a credit review process  including credit reporting agency reports  publicly available customer information  financial statements and other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due at days or less  but payment terms may vary based on the 
table of contents country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance  and often professional services 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the assets under administration  the number of site installations and the number of authorized users 
we categorize our revenues into two reporting elements recurring and non recurring revenues recurring revenues term licenses term license contracts include both the software license and maintenance 
we offer multi year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment that typically spans three years 
for multi year term licenses  we have not established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for the software license and maintenance components and  as a result  in situations where we are also performing related professional services  we defer all revenue and directly related expenses under the arrangement until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
we determine whether services are substantially complete by consulting with our professional services group and applying management judgment 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years  the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
when multi year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services  we recognize the entire term license revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
maintenance we offer annual maintenance programs on perpetual licenses that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled with perpetual license fees in the initial licensing period and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts or separate sales of renewals to customers 
revenue is recognized ratably  or daily  over the term of the maintenance period  typically one year 
other recurring revenues other recurring revenues include revenues from our software as a service saas services  data services and other recurring revenue transactions 
our saas services include advent ondemand  advent ondemand with data management and black diamond 
advent ondemand is the hosting and saas delivery of our suite of investment management solutions 
we recognize revenue ratably over the period of service which is generally one year 
advent ondemand with data management services include access to our software on a saas basis as well as full account aggregation  daily portfolio reconciliation  corporate actions processing and reference data management 
we price this comprehensive service offering based on the number of accounts managed for each customer 
we measure the number of accounts quarterly in arrears and we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed 
black diamond offers a platform that provides outsourced daily reconciliation and data management services as well as portfolio management and reporting delivered through an online web based 
table of contents application 
we price black diamond services based on the number of customers accounts and the daily average of the assets under management aum within those accounts 
we measure the number of accounts and aum within customer accounts monthly in arrears and we recognize revenues for these services as they are performed 
our data services include advent custodial data acd  advent corporate actions aca and advent index data 
we recognize revenue from data services either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur within the subscription  based on the terms of the arrangement 
the company recognizes revenue from other recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur based on the terms of the arrangement 
assets under administration revenues certain of our perpetual and term license contracts include asset based fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using the company software assets under administration or aua 
contracts containing an aua fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self report actual aua in arrears of the specified period 
the company recognizes term aua contract minimum fees over the period of service 
aua fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees 
because incremental fees are neither determinable nor due and payable until the conclusion of the measurement period and reported  they are both earned and recognized upon completion of the measurement period and receipt of the report  on a quarterly or annual basis 
incremental fees from both term aua and perpetual aua contract are included in recurring revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
non recurring revenues professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
we establish vsoe of fair value for professional services upon separate sales of these services to customers 
our professional services are generally billed on a time and materials basis using hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
we recognize revenue as these professional services are performed except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria 
in these cases  revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance 
occasionally  professional services are performed under a fixed fee arrangement 
for these arrangements  we defer revenue and related expenses until the services are complete 
professional services and other revenues also include revenue from our user conferences which is recognized upon completion of the conference 
perpetual licenses we allocate revenue to delivered elements  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services elements  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company stand alone sales of these elements to third parties and or renewal rates 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred unless the only undelivered element is maintenance 
revenues from perpetual licenses are included in non recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents directly related expenses 
when we defer service revenues  we also defer the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those services to the extent those costs are recoverable through future revenues  on non cancelable contracts  as prepaid contract expense 
we recognize those deferred costs as costs of professional services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue 
when we defer license revenue  we defer the direct incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract ie sales commissions earned by the sales force as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract 
we recognize those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues 
income taxes 
we account for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities to be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
many of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that have differing or preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions to reasonably allocate earnings 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  the final outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our income tax provision and accruals 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the recognized net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in the jurisdiction where the tax asset is located 
we consider forecasted earnings  identified future taxable income and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the return is filed and the tax implication is known 
we are subject to audits by state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax matter are judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  stock appreciation rights sars and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behavior  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the company common stock as we believe it is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options and sars granted based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options and 
table of contents sars 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
these variables are sensitive and change on a daily basis 
as a result  the financial result from issuing the same number of options or sars can vary significantly over time 
the following table reflects the change in the fair value of a hypothetical option or sar as a result of a hypothetical change in one of the underlying assumptions assumption base case assumption change value change assumption change value change grant and stock price risk free interest rate volatility expected life years year year expected dividend yield base option value historically  our sar and stock option awards granted to employees cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
in february  we reduced the vesting period from years to years  and subsequently sars and stock option awards granted to employees cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
our restricted stock unit rsu awards generally cliff vest after two years and after four years 
asc  compensation stock compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on our annual forfeiture rate 
the annual forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture experience over the last ten years 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
a decrease in our annual forfeiture rate assumption would increase stock based compensation expense 
the estimated impact of a hypothetical basis point decrease in the annual forfeiture rate on stock based compensation expense for and unamortized stock based compensation expense at december  would have been increases of approximately million and million  respectively 
restructuring charges and related accruals 
we have developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
business combinations 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities  and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of 
table of contents capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
disposition 
when we dispose of a component of the company  we account for the divestiture in accordance with asc  discontinued operations 
the results of operations and the related charges for the discontinued operation are classified as net income from discontinued operation  net of applicable taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in addition  the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operation are reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operation in our consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note discontinued operation to our consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k  for information about our microedge discontinued operation 
goodwill 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  as of november  and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
advent test for goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if advent determines  based on the qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not greater than the carrying amount  then quantitative goodwill impairment test is required 
the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including the development of future revenue and expense forecasts used to calculate future cash flows  the selection of risk adjusted discount rates  and determination of market comparable entities 
refer to note goodwill to our consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k  for information about our annual goodwill testing 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment trigger has occurred is subjective and requires judgment 
our recoverability test compares the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
we estimate future revenue and expense amounts to calculate future cash flows 
we believe our forecast revenue and expense amounts are reasonable but forecast amounts are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
legal contingencies 
from time to time  advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we use our judgment to assess both the likelihood and potential amount of a contingency 
we periodically review our assessment whenever there is a change in the facts and circumstances of these proceedings 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  there 
table of contents exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable 
we use our judgment in estimating our sales returns 
we analyze customer demand  acceptance of products and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are not generally provided 
in certain instances  we also make adjustments to receivable balances for concessions  and product or seat downgrades 
those adjustments are analyzed under the same methodology as performed for the sales returns and included in the reserve balance 
our ability to estimate returns is based on our long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we have recorded a sales returns provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we use our judgment in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivables  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we have recorded a provision for bad debt expense of million in fiscal and million in each of fiscal and

table of contents net revenues in thousands  except percentages total net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year we derive our revenues from two sources recurring revenues and non recurring revenues 
recurring revenues are comprised of term license  perpetual maintenance arrangements and other recurring revenue which includes revenues from black diamond  advent ondemand and incremental assets under administration aua fees from perpetual licenses 
the revenues from a term license  which includes both software license and maintenance services  are earned under a time based contract 
maintenance revenues are derived from maintenance fees on perpetual license arrangements 
other recurring revenues are derived from our subscription services and transaction based services as well as aua fees for certain perpetual arrangements 
non recurring revenues consists of professional services and other revenue and perpetual license fees 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  fees from training  and project management services and our client conferences 
perpetual license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products under a perpetual arrangement 
sales returns  which we generally do not provide to customers  are accounted for as deductions to these two revenue categories based on our historical experience 
revenues derived from recurring sources have approximated of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues revenues from recurring sources revenues from non recurring sources net revenues increased in primarily due to continued customer adoption of our products and services 
the increase in net revenues for was the result of term license and other recurring revenue growth totaling million  or a increase  over the increase in term license revenues was primarily due to sales of our apx  geneva  moxy  tamale and syncova products 
other recurring revenues increased primarily due to sales of our black diamond products  which contributed an additional million to revenues over the increase in our recurring revenues was partially offset by a decrease in our non recurring revenues  which was primarily due to lower consulting activity as we experienced a decline in new service engagements during and an increase in net recognition of the net term license deferral associated with in process term license implementations as a result of more projects completed during the year over year growth in total net revenues for was due to higher revenues from recurring sources  primarily term license revenues  which reflected million or growth in compared to the same period in the increase in term license revenues is primarily due to our bookings activity from the previous months and growth in sales of our apx and geneva products  and to a lesser extent  our moxy and tamale products and revenues from our syncova products  which contributed million of revenue since its acquisition on february  additionally contributing to the increase in recurring revenues was growth from other recurring revenues  which consists of our data services  outsourced services  web based services  aua fees for certain perpetual arrangements and revenues from our black diamond products  which contributed million to revenues since being acquired on june  the increase in non recurring revenues was due to greater consulting activity as we experienced an increase in new service engagements during as a result of bookings from the latter half of and first half of 
table of contents revenues derived from sales outside the us were  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
the slight decrease as a percentage of total revenues during primarily reflects growth outside the us slowing to over  as a result of the continuing european sovereign debt crisis  while us sales grew 
the increase during was primarily due to an increase in new business booked in the prior months due to improved economic conditions in regions where we do business outside the us  and to a lesser extent  increases in the market values of aua balances for our emea customers 
we plan to continue expanding our sales efforts outside the us  both in our current markets and elsewhere 
the revenues from customers in any single country did not exceed of total net revenues

if recognized  the impact on our statement of operations would be to decrease our income tax expense and increase our net income by million 
the impact on net income reflects the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits net of the federal tax benefit of state income tax items 
since almost all of this liability relates to reserves against deferred tax assets that we do not expect to utilize in the short term  we cannot estimate the timing of potential future cash settlements and have not included any estimates in the table of contractual cash obligations above 
our cash payments for federal income taxes will be or less of taxable income through as we have significant net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to utilize 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our liquidity and capital resources in any period could also be affected by the exercise of outstanding employee stock options and sars  and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from this and from the issuance of common stock from our rsus could also affect our per share results of operations 

table of contents however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all 
we expect that for the next year  our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow 
in addition  we may use cash to fund other acquisitions  repurchase additional common stock  or invest in other businesses  when opportunities arise 
based upon the predominance of our revenues from recurring sources  bookings performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operations and availability under our debt agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  interest and repayment of debt principal and financing activities in the next months 
however  if we identify opportunities that exceed our current expectation  we may choose to seek additional capital resources through debt or equity financing 
however  such financing may not be available at all  or if available  may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us  and could be dilutive 
the company has reviewed its needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of its non us subsidiaries 
the company presently intends to continue to invest indefinitely all earnings and cash outside of the united states of all non us subsidiaries to fund investments or meet working capital and property  plant and equipment requirements in those locations 
at december   we had approximately million of cash in our non us subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates on outstanding debt and marketable securities and changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
the company regularly assesses these risks and has established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
foreign currency risk foreign currency transaction risk the company transacts in various foreign currencies and offsets the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with financial institutions 
these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments  nor are they for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exposures typically arise from sales to customers that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recognize gains and losses on these contracts  as well as related costs  in interest and other income expense  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items 
we record the fair value of derivative instruments as either prepaid expenses and other or accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on current market rates 

table of contents at december  and  net derivative liabilities assets associated with the forward contracts of approximately  and  respectively  were included in prepaid expenses and other or accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal and was to reduce foreign exchange gains by approximately  and reduce foreign exchange losses by approximately  respectively  which reflects net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to our derivative financial instruments 
as of december   we had outstanding forward contracts with a notional value of r million south african rand zar  or approximately  foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we include in our consolidated financial statements for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into us dollars 
as of december   million of our goodwill balance was translated from various foreign currencies into us dollars 
a hypothetical change in currency translation rates of could increase or decrease our assets and equity by million and could increase or decrease our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by approximately million 
interest rate risk interest income risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities as of december  our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
interest expense risk we have interest rate risk relating to debt and associated interest expense under our term loan a facility  which is indexed to jpmorgan chase bank  na prime rate or libor 
we estimate that a hypothetical plus or minus of bps would increase or decrease  respectively  our interest expense and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis
