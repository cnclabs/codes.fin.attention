item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report 
overview neonode develops and licenses multisensing touch user interfaces and optical multi touch solutions 
based on zforce  our patented touch technology  neonode has developed a variety of features that sense an object s size  its pressure on a surface  its depth  its velocity and even its proximity to any type of surface 
neonode licenses multisensing touch technology to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms who embed our technology into devices that they produce and sell 
our technology licensing model allows us to focus on the development of solutions for multi touch enabled screens  and thus we do not manufacture products or components 
we license the right to use zforce and neonode multisensing software which  together with standard components from partners  create an optical touch solution 
during the year ended december   we had seven customers using our touchscreen technology in products that were shipping products to customers 
we had an additional seventeen customers with signed license agreements currently in the product development stage 
in most circumstances  our target customers will have to successfully integrate our technology into their products and then sell those products to their customers before we will receive any cash from our technology license agreements 
the number of customers shipping products has increased in compared to and as customer products incorporating our touch technology complete the design phase and are released to the market 
the majority of our license fees currently earned in  and are from customer shipments of ereader products 
in the fourth quarter of  oregon scientific began shipping its meep children s tablet 
we expect to have other customers to begin shipping products such as mobile phones  printers  tablets  gps devices  children s tablets and automotive infotainment systems in license fees earned from customer shipments of ereaders are expected to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as other customer products are introduced to the market 
in the fourth quarter of  amazon discontinued shipping its kindle e readers that incorporated our touch technology 
amazon accounted for of our total net revenue in and of our total net revenue in we don t anticipate receiving any future near term revenues from amazon 
as of december   we had twenty four signed technology license agreements with global oems 
this compares with twelve and four signed technology license agreements with global oems as of december  and  respectively 
seven of our customers are currently shipping products and we anticipate others will initiate product shipments as they complete their final product development and manufacturing cycle throughout in the first quarter of to date  we signed technology license agreements with four new customers in the mobile phone  automotive and tablet markets 
in addition  we are currently developing prototype products and are engaged in product engineering design discussions with numerous global oems who are in the process of qualifying our touchscreen technology for incorporation in various products such as printer products  gps devices  e readers  tablet pcs  touch panels for automobiles  household appliances  mobile phones and games and toys 
the development and product release cycle for these products typically takes six to eighteen months 
current and future drivers of the touchscreen market include mobile phones  printers  automotive  household appliances  tablet pcs  e readers  navigation screens  etc 
the proliferation and mass market acceptance of touchscreens have prompted new applications and uses for existing and new offerings  thus making the production and utilization of these modules one of the fastest growing tech segments 
the typical sales cycle is six to eighteen months with new customers while existing customer lead times are typically six to nine months 
during the initial cycle  there are three phases evaluation  design  and commercialization 
in the evaluation phase  prospects validate the neonode technology using a neonode evaluation kit and may produce short runs of prototype products 
during the design phase  true product development and solution definition begins 
this phase tends to be the longest and delays typically occur which may extend the term of the overall cycle 
in the final phase  commercialization  the customer enters into full production mode  ships products to the market and neonode earns its license revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and include the accounts of neonode inc and its wholly owned subsidiary based in sweden  neonode technologies ab 
all inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the accounting policies affecting our financial condition and results of operations are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates  which inherently contain some degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the historical experience and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the reported carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires making estimates and assumptions that affect  at the date of the consolidated financial statements  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include  but are not limited to  collectability of accounts receivable  recoverability of long lived assets  the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and the fair value of options and warrants issued for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition engineering services we may sell engineering consulting services to our customers on a flat rate or hourly rate basis 
we recognize revenue from these services when all of the following conditions are met evidence existed of an arrangement with the customer  typically consisting of a purchase order or contract  our services were performed and risk of loss passed to the customer  we completed all of the necessary terms of the contract  the amount of revenue to which we were entitled was fixed or determinable  and we believed it was probable that we would be able to collect the amount due from the customer 
to the extent that one or more of these conditions has not been satisfied  we defer recognition of revenue 
generally  we recognize revenue as the engineering services stipulated under the contract are completed and accepted by our customers 
licensing revenues we also derive revenue from the licensing of internally developed intellectual property ip 
we enter into ip licensing agreements that generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our ip components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee 
the ip licensing agreements generally include a nonexclusive license for the underlying ip 
fees under these agreements may include license fees relating to our ip and royalties payable following the production by our licensees of products incorporating the licensed technology 
the license for our ip has standalone value and can be used by the licensee without maintenance and support 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of our customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  or other material events impacting its business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover 
should all efforts fail to recover the related receivable  we will write off the account 
we also record an allowance for all customers based on certain other factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and our historical collection experience with customers 
product research and development research and development r d costs are expensed as incurred 
r d costs consist mainly of personnel related costs in addition to some external consultancy costs such as testing  certifying and measurements 
stock based compensation expense we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including share options  based on the fair value of the award on grant date  and recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees at their fair value 
the measurement date for the fair value for the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached  or ii the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete 
in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants  the fair value of the equity instruments is primarily recognized over the term of the consulting agreement 
the fair value of the stock based compensation is periodically re measured and income or expense is recognized during the vesting term 
when determining stock based compensation expense involving options and warrants  we determine the estimated fair value of options and warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is the applicable local currency  the swedish krona 
the translation from swedish krona to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income statement accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period 
gains or losses resulting from translation are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and were   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  our foreign currency translation gains losses totaled   and  respectively 
net loss per share net loss per share amounts have been computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
net loss per share  assuming dilution amounts from common stock equivalents  is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock equivalents outstanding during the period 
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock equivalents used in computing the net loss per share for the year ended december   and  respectively  exclude the potential common stock equivalents  as the effect would be anti dilutive 
comprehensive loss our comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation gains and losses as a result of consolidation 
the cumulative amount of translation gains and losses are reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
cash flow information cash flows in foreign currencies have been converted to us dollars at an approximate weighted average exchange rate for the respective reporting periods 
the weighted average exchange rate for the consolidated statements of operations was  and swedish krona to one us dollar for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the exchange rate for the consolidated balance sheets was and swedish krona to one us dollar as of december  and  respectively 
deferred revenue as of december  and  we have million and million  respectively  of deferred license fee revenue related to prepayments for future license fees from three and one customers  respectively  and a total of million and million  respectively  of deferred engineering development fees from thirteen and four customers  respectively 
we defer the license fees until we have met all accounting requirements for revenue recognition as per unit royalty products are distributed or licensed by the company s customers and the engineering development fee revenue until such time as the engineering work has been completed and accepted by our customers 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for gross presentation of activity in level which is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and for interim periods in those years

our net revenue for the year ended december  included million from technology license fees from four customers and  in non recurring engineering services related to our touchscreen solution from six customers 
under the terms of one of our contracts entered into in  the customer prepaid million of technology licenses prior to shipment of its first product 
the million pre payment was included in deferred revenue and was amortized to revenue as units were licensed or distributed 
for the year ended december  and   and million in license fees related to units licensed or distributed under the million prepayment have been recognized as revenue  respectively  and as of december   million remained in deferred revenue from this customer s prepayment 
our net revenue for the year ended december  was  and includes  in fees for engineering design services from five customers   for the sale of components to one customer  and  from technology license fees related to our touchscreen solution from one customer 
as of december   we had twenty four signed technology license agreements with global oems 
this compares with twelve and four signed technology license agreements with global oems as of december  and  respectively 
seven of our customers are currently shipping products and we anticipate others will initiate product shipments as they complete their final product development and manufacturing cycle throughout gross margin gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our cost of revenues includes the direct cost of production of certain customer prototypes  costs of company employed engineering personnel and engineering consultants to complete the engineering design contract 
our gross margin has increased due to the increase in our total revenue particularly our license fee revenue 
the gross margin related to our license fees is and when license fees as a percentage of our total revenue increase our gross margin will increase 
product research and development product research and development r d expenses for each of the year ended december  were million compared to million for both the years ended december  and r d costs consist of the cost of prototypes and other materials  consultants  and the amount of time our engineering department spent engaged in customer specific activities 
we continue to pursue and expand r d expenditures on the development of our touchscreen and other technologies 
we have a development roadmap based on our touchscreen and other technologies 
as of december   our r d department had twenty six full time employees 
our r d department had eighteen full time employees compared to eight full time employees and one part time consultant at december  and  respectively

included in s m expenses are approximately million of non cash stock option and warrant expense for the year ended december  compared to approximately  and  for the same periods in and  respectively 
our sales activities focus primarily on oem customers who will integrate our touchscreen technology into their products 
our oem customers will then sell and market their products incorporating our technology to their customers 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the year ended december  compared to and is primarily due to an increase in headcount and legal fees  particularly legal fees related to patent filings 
as of december  we had seven full time employees in our g a department fulfilling management and accounting responsibilities compared to three employees and one part time consultant as of both december  and included in g a expenses are approximately million of non cash stock option and warrant expense for the year ended december  compared to approximately  and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
the slight decrease in as compared to is primarily related to a decrease in non cash fair value of warrants issued to employees that was partially offset by an increase in patent related legal fees and financial consultant costs 
amortization of fair value of stock issued to related parties for purchase of neonode technologies ab on december   we entered into a share exchange agreement with neonode technologies ab and the stockholders of neonode technologies ab iwo jima sarl  wirelesstoys ab  and athemis ltd the neonode technologies ab stockholders  pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of neonode technologies ab in exchange for the issuance of  shares of the company s series a preferred stock 
pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement  upon the closing of the transaction  neonode technologies ab became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the neonode technologies ab stockholders are or were employees of us and or neonode ab  and as such were related parties

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources other than the operating leases noted above 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support  or engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is dependent on many factors  including sales volume  operating profit and the efficiency of asset use and turnover 
our future liquidity will be affected by  among other things actual versus anticipated licensing of our technology  our actual versus anticipated operating expenses  the timing of our oem customer product shipments  the timing of payment for our technology licensing agreements  our actual versus anticipated gross profit margin  our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  and our ability to secure credit facilities  if necessary 
at december   we had cash of million  as compared to million at december  working capital current assets less current liabilities was million at december   compared to an adjusted working capital of million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of i a net loss of approximately million and ii approximately million in net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
cash used to fund net losses is reduced by approximately million in non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
accounts receivable decreased approximately million at december  compared with december   primarily as a result of net revenues of approximately million in the fourth quarter of compared to approximately million in the fourth quarter of during and  we were successful in collecting cash from sales to our customers substantially in accordance with our standard payment terms to those customers 
deferred revenue increased approximately million during primarily as a result of additional license technology agreements and engineering projects entered into during as compared to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of i a net loss of approximately million and ii approximately million in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
cash used to fund net losses is reduced by approximately million in net non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of stock based compensation and discounts and deferred financing fees and the valuation of conversion features and warrants

cash used to fund net losses is reduced by approximately million of non cash stock based compensation  million of loss on extinguishment of debt and million on discounts and deferred financing fees and the valuation of conversion features and warrants 
in the years ended december   and  we purchased   and  respectively of fixed assets  consisting primarily of computers and engineering equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately  during the year ended december  from the exercise of warrants for shares of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which consist of net proceeds of approximately million from issuances of convertible debt  net proceeds of approximately  from exercise of warrants and net proceeds of approximately million from issuances of common stock 
such increases were offset by repayment of convertible debt of approximately  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which consist of net proceeds of approximately million from issuances of convertible debt  net proceeds of approximately  from exercise of warrants and net proceeds of approximately million from issuances of common stock 
historically  the majority of our cash has been provided by borrowings from senior secured notes and bridge notes that have been convertible into shares of our common stock or from the sale of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants to private investors 
during  we raised approximately million through debt and equity offerings 
we believe we have sufficient cash to operate for at least the next twelve months 
in the future  we may require sources of capital in addition to cash on hand to continue operations and to implement our strategy 
if our operations do not become cash flow positive  we may be forced to seek credit line facilities from financial institutions  additional private equity investment or debt arrangements 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if funds are available  the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity could dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall  and the issuance of debt securities could impose restrictive covenants that could impair our ability to engage in certain business transactions 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is the applicable local currency  the swedish krona  and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
any increase or decrease in the exchange rate of the us dollar compared to the swedish krona will impact neonode s future operating results
