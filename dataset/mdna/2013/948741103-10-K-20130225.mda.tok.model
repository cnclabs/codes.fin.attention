item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a reit organized under the texas business organizations code 
we  and our predecessor entity  began the ownership and development of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping centers we own or lease 
we also manage centers for joint ventures in which we are partners or for other outside owners for which we charge fees 
we operate a portfolio of rental properties  primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers  that totals approximately million million square feet of gross leasable area that is either owned by us or others 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during our long term strategy is to focus on improving our core operations and increasing shareholder value 
we accomplish this through hands on leasing and management  selective redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  disciplined growth from strategic acquisitions and new developments  as well as dispositions of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we remain committed to maintaining a conservatively leveraged balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
under our current capital recycling plan  we continue to dispose of non core operating properties  which provides capital for growth opportunities and strengthens our operating fundamentals 
during  we have successfully disposed of million of real estate assets  both directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships and excluding the industrial portfolio transaction referred to below 
this program is ongoing  and we expect to complete dispositions in the range of million to million in we have approximately million of dispositions currently under contracts or letters of intent  however  there are no assurances that these transactions will close 
upon the completion of this plan  we believe our remaining portfolio of shopping centers will be among the strongest in our sector 
in addition to the capital recycling plan described above  in may  we sold a portfolio of wholly owned industrial properties for a gross selling price of million to dra fund vii llc  an affiliate of dra advisors llc 
the portfolio consisted of industrial properties  aggregating approximately million square feet located in florida  georgia  tennessee  texas and virginia 
also  in  our interest in industrial properties  held in unconsolidated joint ventures in which we are a partner  were sold directly by the joint venture or through the sale of our interest 
by exiting the industrial real estate market  we have successfully accomplished our goal of positioning ourselves as a reit dedicated to the retail real estate market 
as we are generally selling lower tier  non core assets  potential buyers looking to finance such acquisitions may find access to capital an issue 
even with these conditions  we continue to believe we will successfully execute our disposition plan  although further weaknesses in the secured lending markets or a downturn in the economy could impact our ability to execute this plan 
we will continue to actively seek acquisitions and new development opportunities to grow our operations 
despite the substantial competition for quality acquisition opportunities  we have been able to close on million during we will continue to identify select properties that meet our return hurdles and to actively evaluate other opportunities as they enter the market 
for  we expect to invest in acquisitions and new developments in a range similar to our dispositions of million to million 

table of contents we strive to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure which provides ready access to a variety of attractive long and short term capital sources 
we carefully balance lower cost short term financing with long term liabilities associated with acquired or developed long term assets 
the funds from the industrial transaction in may allowed us to significantly reduce our debt levels 
specifically  we paid off our million term loan  a million fixed rate medium term note and reduced amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  in october  we issued million of senior unsecured notes maturing in this offering allowed us to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our convertible senior unsecured notes totaling million 
also during  we redeemed our series e cumulative redeemable preferred shares with a redemption value of million 
these transactions continue to strengthen our balance sheet and further enhance our access to various sources of capital 
while the availability of capital has improved over the past year  there can be no assurance that favorable pricing and availability will not deteriorate in the future 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and two properties under various stages of construction and development 
the total number of centers includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and six other operating properties located in states spanning the country from coast to coast 
we also owned interests in parcels of land held for development that totaled approximately million square feet at december  we had approximately  leases with  different tenants at december  leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments  which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
through this challenging economic environment  we believe the stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
retail operational metrics in assessing the performance of our shopping centers  management carefully monitors various operating metrics of the portfolio 
below are performance metrics associated with our occupancy  same property net operating income spnoi growth and leasing activity on a pro rata basis 
december  anchor represents any tenant at least  square feet non anchor total occupancy three months ended december  twelve months ended december  spnoi growth 
see non gaap financial measures for a definition of the measurement of spnoi and a reconciliation to operating income within this section of item 
table of contents number of leases square feet s average new rent per square foot average prior rent per square foot average cost of tenant improvements per square foot change in base rent on cash basis leasing activity three months ended december  retail new leases 
retail renewals not comparable spaces total twelve months ended december  retail new leases 
retail renewals not comparable spaces total average lease commissions per square foot for the three and twelve months ended december  were and  respectively 
the operating metrics of our portfolio strengthened in as the economy continued to stabilize  and we focused on increasing occupancy and spnoi 
our portfolio delivered exceptional operating results with an increase in occupancy of 
over  an increase of in non anchor shop spaces less than  square feet occupancy over  an increase of in spnoi over  and rental rate increases for of  which includes an increase of on new leases 
while we will continue to monitor the economy and the effects on our tenants  we believe the significant diversification of our portfolio  both geographically and by tenant base  and the quality of our portfolio will allow us to further increase occupancy levels as we move through  assuming no bankruptcies by multiple national or regional tenants 
a stabilization in economic conditions and a reduction in quality retail space available contributed to the increase in overall rental rates on a same space basis as we completed new leases and renewed existing leases 
while we have achieved strong growth in both rental rates and spnoi during  maintaining this level of positive operating performance through is not assured 
leasing volume is anticipated to decline as we have less vacant space available for leasing and are experiencing reductions in tenant fallout 
new development at december   we had two properties in various stages of construction and development 
we have funded million to date on these projects  and we estimate our aggregate net investment upon completion to be million 
overall  the average projected stabilized return on investment for these properties is approximately upon completion 
we have approximately million in land held for development at december  while we are experiencing a greater interest than previous years from retailers and other market participants in our land held for development  opportunities for economically viable developments remain scarce 
we continue to pursue additional development and redevelopment opportunities in multiple markets  however  finding the right opportunities remains very challenging 
acquisitions and joint ventures acquisitions are a key component of our long term strategy 
the availability of quality acquisition opportunities in the market remains sporadic 
competition for the highest quality core properties is intense which has in many cases driven pricing to pre recession highs 
we remain disciplined in approaching these opportunities  pursuing only those that provide appropriate risk adjusted returns 

table of contents dispositions dispositions are also a key component of our ongoing management process where we selectively prune properties from our portfolio that no longer meet our geographic or growth targets 
dispositions provide capital  which may be recycled into properties that have high barrier to entry locations within high growth metropolitan markets  and thus have higher long term growth potential 
additionally  proceeds from dispositions may be used to reduce outstanding debt  further deleveraging our balance sheet 
over time  we expect this will produce a portfolio with higher occupancy rates and stronger revenue growth 
our disposition program may be impacted by market pricing conditions and debt financing available to prospective purchasers 
after specifically identifying potential disposition properties and analyzing current market data  we recognized an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  on properties which we believe are either probable to sell or were sold as part of this initiative 
summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships  management evaluates the characteristics of associated entities and determines whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and  if so  determines which party is the primary beneficiary by analyzing whether we have both the power to direct the entity s significant economic activities and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or receive potentially significant benefits 
significant judgments and assumptions inherent in this analysis include the design of the entity structure  the nature of the entity s operations  future cash flow projections  the entity s financing and capital structure  and contractual relationships and terms 
we consolidate a vie when we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
primary risks associated with our vies include the potential funding of the entities debt obligations or making additional contributions to fund the entities operations 
partially owned  non variable interest real estate joint ventures and partnerships over which we have a controlling financial interest are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
in determining if we have a controlling financial interest  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships where we do not have a controlling financial interest  but have the ability to exercise significant influence  are accounted for using the equity method 
management continually analyzes and assesses reconsideration events  including changes in the factors mentioned above  to determine if the consolidation treatment remains appropriate 
decisions regarding consolidation of partially owned entities frequently require significant judgment by our management 
errors in the assessment of consolidation could result in material changes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents property acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
estimates of fair values are based upon future cash flows and other valuation techniques in accordance with our fair value measurements accounting policy 
fair values are used to record the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  tenant improvements  other identifiable intangibles and any goodwill or gain on purchase 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place as is versus as if vacant and absorption costs  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and over the lease term which includes bargain renewal options for other identifiable intangible assets 
the impact of these estimates  including incorrect estimates in connection with acquisition values and estimated useful lives  could result in significant differences related to the purchased assets  liabilities and resulting depreciation or amortization 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
impairment our property is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property  including any capitalized costs and any identifiable intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future  with consideration of applicable holding periods  on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
if we determine the carrying amount is not recoverable  our basis in the property is reduced to its estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset 
fair values are determined by management utilizing cash flow models  market capitalization and discount rates  or by obtaining third party broker or appraisal estimates in accordance with our fair value measurements accounting policy 
we review current economic considerations each reporting period  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  the suspension of tenant expansion plans for new development projects  declines in real estate values and any changes to plans related to our new development projects including land held for development  to identify properties where we believe market values may be deteriorating 
determining whether a property is impaired and  if impaired  the amount of write down to fair value requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation 
the evaluations used in these analyses could result in incorrect estimates when determining carrying values that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our investment in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships is reviewed for impairment each reporting period 
the ultimate realization is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the estimated fair value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation 
our overall future plans for the investment  our investment partner s financial outlook and our views on current market and economic conditions may have a significant impact on the resulting factors analyzed for these purposes 
our investments in tax increment revenue bonds are reviewed for impairment  including the evaluation of changes in events or circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 
realization is dependent on a number of factors  including investment performance  market conditions and payment structure 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary  recovery of its cost basis is uncertain  and or it is uncertain if the investment will be held to maturity 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation  which may produce incorrect estimates that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table is a summary of certain items from our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  which we believe represent items that significantly changed during as compared to the same period in year ended december  change change revenues depreciation and amortization operating expenses impairment loss interest expense  net gain on sale of real estate joint venture and partnership interests equity in losses earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnerships  net gain on acquisition revenues the increase in revenues of million is primarily attributable to an increase in net rental revenues of million associated with increases in occupancy and rental rates  revenue from new development completions of million and the acquisition of four shopping centers and other property in  including the purchase of a unconsolidated joint venture interest  and two properties in  which totaled million in revenue 
offsetting this net rental revenue increase is a decrease in other income of million  which was attributable to a decline in miscellaneous revenue 
depreciation and amortization the increase of million is due to new development completions  the acquisition of four shopping centers in and two shopping centers in and other capital activities 
operating expenses the increase in operating expenses of million is attributable to an increase in management fees of million  which results primarily from a fair value increase in the assets held in a grantor trust related to our deferred compensation plan  a million increase in acquisition costs and an increase in overall operating expenses  of which acquisitions and new development completions totaled million and 
million  respectively 
impairment loss the impairment loss in of million is mainly attributable to three properties being marketed for sale during the year  an equity interest in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owns industrial properties and the sale of unimproved land parcels 
the impairment loss in of million related primarily to land held for development  properties that were sold or marketed for sale  our equity interest in certain unconsolidated joint ventures and the net credit loss on the exchange of tax increment revenue bonds

table of contents impairment loss the impairment loss in of million related primarily to land held for development  properties that were sold or marketed for sale  our equity interest in certain unconsolidated joint ventures and the net credit loss on the exchange of tax increment revenue bonds 
the impairment loss of million was attributable to losses associated with the revaluation of two unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to fair value and its associated tax increment revenue bonds and a note  land held for development and the disposition of a retail building and an undeveloped land tract

equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnerships  net the decrease of million or is primarily attributable to an increase in impairment losses in  associated primarily with reduced holding periods at finite life joint ventures  which is offset by earnings from our investment in a shopping center acquired in the fourth quarter of effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rental rates during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  allowing us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and real estate taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as real estate tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
under the current economic climate  little to no inflation is occurring 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are paying our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  paying our debt service costs  excluding debt maturities  and funding capital expenditures 
under our business plan  cash flows from operating activities are expected to meet these planned capital needs 

table of contents the primary sources of capital for funding any debt maturities and acquisitions are our credit facilities  proceeds from both secured and unsecured debt issuances  proceeds from common and preferred equity issuances  cash generated from the sale of property and the formation of joint ventures  and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from the disposition of properties and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
as of december   we had an available balance of million under our revolving credit facility  and our debt maturities for total million 
in  we issued million of senior unsecured notes maturing in proceeds from this offering allowed us to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and to repay our convertible senior unsecured notes totaling million 
we also redeemed our series e cumulative redeemable preferred shares with a redemption value of million 
the funding of this redemption was under our revolving credit facility 
we believe proceeds from our disposition program  combined with our available capacity under the credit facilities  will provide adequate liquidity to fund our capital needs  including acquisitions and new development activities 
in the event our disposition program does not progress as expected  we believe other debt and equity alternatives are available to us 
although external market conditions are not within our control  we do not currently foresee any reasons that would prevent us from entering the capital markets if needed 
during  we have received gross sales proceeds of million related to dispositions 
these proceeds were used primarily to repay our million unsecured term loan  matured fixed rate medium term notes  and to fund million in acquisitions 
operating cash flows from discontinued operations are included in net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows  while proceeds from discontinued operations are included as investing activities 
at december   discontinued operations represent of our net cash from operating activities  and we would expect future net cash from operating activities to decrease accordingly when compared to prior periods 
we have non recourse debt secured by acquired or developed properties held in several of our real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
off balance sheet mortgage debt for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled million  of which our ownership percentage is million at december  scheduled principal mortgage payments on this debt  excluding non cash related items totaling million  at are as follows in millions thereafter total we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate contracts with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain our joint venture partners consent or a third party consent for assets held in special purpose entities  which are owned by us 
investing activities acquisitions during  we acquired four shopping centers and other property for approximately million  which includes the acquisition of a partner interest in an unconsolidated tenancy in common arrangement 
dispositions during  we sold shopping centers  industrial properties and other retail property  either directly or through our interests in real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we also sold six unconsolidated real estate joint venture interests and assigned a consolidated joint venture interest to a partner 
aggregate gross sales proceeds including the assumption of debt from these transactions totaled million and generated gains of million 

table of contents new development at december   we had two projects under various stages of construction and development with a total square footage of approximately 
million 
overall  we expect our aggregate net investment in these properties upon completion to be million 
our new development projects are financed initially under our revolving credit facility  as it is our practice not to use third party construction financing 
management monitors amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and periodically pays down such balances using cash generated from operations  from debt issuances  from common and preferred share issuances and from dispositions of properties 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for additions to the existing portfolio  acquisitions  tenant improvements  new development and our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships are as follows in thousands year ended december  acquisitions tenant improvements new development redevelopment other total for  we anticipate our acquisitions to total between million and million 
we anticipate our tenant improvement expenditures to be comparable with our new development investment for is estimated to be approximately million to million 
further  we have entered into commitments aggregating million comprised principally of construction contracts which are generally due in to months and anticipated to be funded under our revolving credit facility 
financing activities debt total debt outstanding was billion at december  and included billion on which interest rates are fixed and million  including the effect of million of interest rate contracts  which bears interest at variable rates 
additionally  of our total debt  million was secured by operating properties while the remaining billion was unsecured 
we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september and provides borrowing rates that float at a margin over libor plus a facility fee 
the borrowing margin and facility fee  which are priced off a grid that is tied to our senior unsecured credit ratings  are currently and basis points  respectively 
the facility also contains a competitive bid feature that will allow us to request bids for up to million 
additionally  an accordion feature allows us to increase the facility amount up to million 
as of february   we had million amounts outstanding  and the available balance was million  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
we also have an agreement with a bank for an unsecured and uncommitted overnight facility totaling million that we maintain for cash management purposes 
the facility provides for fixed interest rate loans at a day libor rate plus a borrowing margin based on market liquidity 
as of february   we had million amounts outstanding under this facility 
during  the maximum balance and weighted average balance outstanding under both facilities combined were million and million  respectively  at a weighted average interest rate of we used the proceeds from the sale of our wholly owned industrial properties to pay off our million term loan  a million fixed rate medium term note that matured in may  and reduced amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
in  we issued million of senior unsecured notes maturing in this offering allowed us to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and were used to repay our convertible senior unsecured notes totaling million 

table of contents our five most restrictive covenants include debt to assets  secured debt to assets  fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage and debt yield ratios 
we believe we were in full compliance with our public debt and revolving credit facility covenants as of december  our most restrictive public debt covenant ratios  as defined in our indenture and supplemental indenture agreements  were as follows at december  covenant restriction actual debt to asset ratio less than secured debt to asset ratio less than annual service charge ratio greater than unencumbered asset test greater than at december   we had four interest rate contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that were designated as fair value hedges and convert fixed interest payments at rates ranging from to to variable interest payments ranging from 
to we also have three interest rate contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges 
these contracts have maturities through september and either fix or cap interest rates ranging from to 
we have determined that these contracts are highly effective in offsetting future variable interest cash flows 
we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties related to our interest rate contracts  however  management believes such nonperformance is unlikely 
equity in february  our board of trust managers approved an increase in our quarterly dividend rate for our common shares from 
to 
per share commencing with the first quarter distribution 
common and preferred dividends paid totaled million during our dividend payout ratio as calculated as dividends paid on common shares divided by funds from operations ffo basic for was approximately  which is inclusive of non cash transactions including impairment charges and other non cash items 
in november  we redeemed our series e cumulative redeemable preferred shares with a redemption value of million 
the funding of this redemption was under our revolving credit facility 
on february   we called our series d cumulative redeemable preferred shares with a redemption value of million  which will settle on march  we have an effective universal shelf registration statement which expires in october we will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider our available financing alternatives  including both public offerings and private placements 

table of contents contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans and unsecured debt  including any draws on our credit facilities 
we have shopping centers that are subject to non cancelable long term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and or operate a shopping center 
in addition  we have non cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business 
the table below excludes obligations related to our new development projects because such amounts are not fixed or determinable  and commitments aggregating million comprised principally of construction contracts which are generally due in to months 
the following table summarizes our primary contractual obligations as of december  in thousands thereafter total mortgages and notes payable 
unsecured debt secured debt lease payments other obligations 
total contractual obligations includes principal and interest with interest on variable rate debt calculated using rates at december   excluding the effect of interest rate swaps 
also  excludes a million debt service guaranty liability 
other obligations include income and real estate tax payments  commitments associated with our secured debt and other employee payments 
included in  is the estimated contribution to our retirement plan  which meets or exceeds the minimum statutory funding requirements 
see note for additional information 
related to our investment in a development project in sheridan  colorado  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have each provided a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with the project 
in  the sheridan redevelopment agency agency reissued million of series a bonds used for an urban renewal project 
the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee pif to be assessed on current and future retail sales and  to the extent necessary  any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty 
the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or the debt associated with this guaranty has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   none of our off balance sheet arrangements had a material effect on our liquidity or availability of  or requirement for  our capital resources 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  we have entered into several unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
under many of these agreements  we and our joint venture partners are required to fund operating capital upon shortfalls in working capital 
we have also committed to fund the capital requirements of several new development joint ventures 
as operating manager of most of these entities  we have considered these funding requirements in our business plan 
reconsideration events  including changes in variable interests  could cause us to consolidate these joint ventures and partnerships 
we continuously evaluate these events as we become aware of them 
some triggers to be considered are additional contributions required by each partner and each partner s ability to make those contributions 
under certain of these circumstances  we may purchase our partner s interest 
our material unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are with entities which appear sufficiently stable  however  if market conditions were to continue to deteriorate and our partners are unable to meet their commitments  there is a possibility we may have to consolidate these entities 
if we were to consolidate all of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures  we would still be in compliance with our debt covenants 

table of contents as of december   two unconsolidated real estate joint ventures were determined to be vies through the issuance of secured loans  since the lenders have the ability to make decisions that could have a significant impact on the profitability of the entities 
our maximum risk of loss associated with these vies was limited to million at december  we have a real estate limited partnership agreement with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
to date  no properties have been purchased 
non gaap financial measures certain of our key performance indicators are considered non gaap financial measures 
management uses these measures along with our gaap financial statements in order to evaluate our operating results 
we believe these additional measures provide users of our financial information additional comparable indicators of our industry  as well as  our performance 
funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and interests in real estate equity investments  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties and impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments  including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
we believe ffo is a widely recognized measure of reit operating performance which provides our shareholders with a relevant basis for comparison among other reits 
management uses ffo as a supplemental internal measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 

table of contents ffo is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income loss attributable to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships impairment of operating properties and real estate equity investments impairment of operating properties of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships gain on acquisition gain on sale of property and interests in real estate equity investments gain loss on sale of property of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships funds from operations basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards weighted average shares outstanding diluted funds from operations per share basic funds from operations per share diluted same property net operating income we consider spnoi to be a key indicator of our financial performance as it provides a better indication of the recurring cash return on our properties by excluding certain non cash revenues and expenses  as well as other infrequent or one time items 
we believe a pro rata basis is the most useful measurement as it provides our proportional share of spnoi from all owned properties  including our share of spnoi from unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships  which cannot be readily determined under gaap measurements and presentation 
although spnoi is a widely used measure among reits  there can be no assurance that spnoi presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 

table of contents properties are included in the spnoi calculation if they are owned and operated for the entirety of the most recent two fiscal year periods  except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods presented  and properties classified as discontinued operations 
while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations  we move new development and redevelopment properties once they have stabilized  which is typically upon attainment of occupancy 
a rollforward of the properties included in our same property designation is as follows three months ended december  twelve months ended december  beginning of the period properties added acquisitions new developments redevelopments properties removed dispositions redevelopments end of the period we calculate spnoi using operating income as defined by gaap excluding property management fees  certain non cash revenues and expenses such as straight line rental revenue and the related reversal of such amounts upon early lease termination  depreciation  amortization  impairment losses  general and administrative expenses  acquisition costs and other one time items such as lease cancellation revenue  environmental abatement costs and demolition expenses 
consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under gaap  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are excluded from spnoi 
a reconciliation of operating income to spnoi is as follows in thousands three months ended december  twelve months ended december  operating income less revenue adjustments 
add property management fees depreciation and amortization impairment loss general and administrative acquisition costs other 
net operating income less noi related to consolidated entities not defined as same property and noncontrolling interests add pro rata share of unconsolidated entities defined as same property same property net operating income revenue adjustments consist primarily of straight line rentals and lease cancellation income 
other includes items such as environmental abatement costs and demolition expenses 

table of contents newly issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which requires entities to provide new disclosures about offsetting and related arrangements for financial instruments and derivatives 
the provisions of asu no 
are effective for us on january   and are required to be applied retrospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate contracts with major financial institutions 
these agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate contracts 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points and holding all other variables constant  annual net income and cash flows for the following year would decrease by approximately million associated with our variable rate debt  including the effect of the interest rate contracts 
the effect of the basis points increase would decrease the fair value of our variable rate and fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively
