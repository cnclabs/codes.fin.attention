item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates of this report 
our corporate offices and several of our radio stations are located in florida and other areas that could be affected by hurricanes 
florida is susceptible to hurricanes and we have our corporate offices and eleven radio stations located there 
these radio stations contributed of our net revenue in although the hurricane season did not have a material impact on our operations  our corporate offices and our radio stations located in florida and along the east coast of the united states could be materially affected by hurricanes in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we carry property damage insurance on all of our properties and business interruption insurance on some of our properties  but there can be no assurance that such insurance would be adequate to cover all of our hurricane related losses 

table of contents the failure or destruction of satellite systems and transmitter facilities that we depend upon to distribute our programming could adversely affect our operating results 
we use studios  satellite systems  transmitter facilities and the internet to originate and or distribute our station programs and commercials 
we rely on third party contracts and services to operate our origination and distribution facilities 
these third party contracts and services include  but are not limited to  electrical power  satellite transponders  uplinks and downlinks and telecom circuits 
distribution may be disrupted due to one or more third parties losing their ability to provide particular services to us  which could adversely affect our distribution capabilities 
a disruption can be caused as a result of any number of events such as local disasters accidental or environmental  various acts of terrorism  power outages  major telecom connectivity failures or satellite failures 
our ability to distribute programming to station audiences may be disrupted for an undetermined period of time until alternate facilities are engaged and put on line 
furthermore  until third party services resume  the inability to originate or distribute programming could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation 
vigorous enforcement of the fcc s indecency rules could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and pm 
broadcasters risk of violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material is increased by the vagueness of the fcc s definition of indecent material  coupled with the spontaneity of live programming 
the fcc has expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered blasphemy  personally reviling epithets  profanity and vulgar or coarse words amounting to a nuisance 
as a result  in the event that we broadcast material falling within the expanded breadth of the fcc s regulation  we could be subject to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings  which would put the licenses that we depend on for our operations in jeopardy 
in  the monetary penalties for broadcasting indecent programming increased substantially 
other legislative proposals have been keyed to the number of violations found by the fcc and would potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualifications proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
formerly  the maximum permitted fines for adjudicated violations of the fcc s indecency rules were  per instance and  for each continuing violation 
the current maximum permitted fines are  per incident and  for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act 
in a decision issued in june  the supreme court did not find that the fcc s indecency standards were inconsistent with the first amendment  which means the fcc may continue to enforce the standards 
because the fcc may investigate indecency complaints prior to notifying a licensee of the existence of a complaint  a licensee may not have knowledge of a complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal fcc letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture 
we may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our radio stations broadcast of indecent or obscene material 
to the extent that these pending inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines  revocation of any of our radio station licenses or denials of license renewal applications  our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected 
proposed legislation could require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and recording artists 
legislation has previously been introduced in congress that would require radio broadcasters to pay a royalty to record labels and performing artists for use of their recorded songs 
the legislation failed to pass but is expected to be reintroduced 
currently  we pay royalties to song composers and publishers through broadcast music  inc bmi  the american society of composers  authors and publishers ascap and sesac  inc sesac 
the proposed legislation would add an additional layer of royalties to be paid directly to the record labels and artists 
it is currently unknown what proposed legislation  if any  will become law  whether industry groups will enter into an agreement with respect to fees  and what significance this royalty would have on our results from operations  cash flows or financial position 
the fcc s national broadband plan may result in a loss of spectrum for broadcast stations and potentially adversely impact our ability to compete 
in march  the fcc delivered its national broadband plan to congress 
the plan reviews the nation s broadband infrastructure and recommends a number of initiatives designed to spur broadband deployment and use 
in an effort to make available more spectrum for wireless broadband services  the broadband plan proposes to recapture and relocate certain spectrum including megahertz of broadcast spectrum  by incentivizing current private sector spectrum holders to return some of their spectrum to the government by through such initiatives as voluntary spectrum auctions with current licensees potentially sharing in the auction proceeds and repacking of television channel assignments to increase efficient spectrum usage 
if voluntary measures fail to provide the amount of spectrum the fcc considers necessary for wireless broadband deployment  the broadband plan proposes various mandates to reclaim spectrum  such as forced channel sharing 
in november  the fcc issued rulemakings containing proposals that would enable wireless providers to have equal access to broadcast spectrum that could be made available through spectrum auctions 
in february  congress passed legislation authorizing the fcc to conduct a reverse incentive auction in 
table of contents which licensees of television stations may voluntarily relinquish their spectrum usage rights in exchange for a portion of the proceeds received from new licensees who successfully bid in a forward auction for the right to use the repurposed spectrum 
the statute also authorizes the fcc to repack the spectrum now used by television broadcasters  subject to certain limitations  including the obligation to make all reasonable efforts to preserve the coverage area and population served by a television station 
in october  the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking that includes proposals for the conduct of the reverse and forward spectrum auctions and the spectrum repacking process 
at this time we cannot predict the timing or outcome of implementation of the broadband plan or whether it will have an impact on our radio stations  or whether or when congress will authorize the fcc to conduct incentive based auctions 
our business depends on the efforts of key personnel and the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees  including george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
beasley is years old 
we believe the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by mr 
beasley would be difficult to replace and that the loss of mr 
beasley s or other key executives expertise could impair our ability to execute our operating and acquisition strategies 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer controls beasley broadcast group  inc and members of his immediate family own a substantial equity interest in beasley broadcast group  inc their interests may conflict with yours 
george g 
beasley is generally able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
without the approval of mr 
beasley  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change in control  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
shares of class b and class a common stock that mr 
beasley beneficially owns represent of the total voting power of all classes of our common stock 
members of his immediate family also own significant amounts of class b common stock 
mr 
beasley will be able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws or applicable law 
historically  we have entered into certain transactions with george g 
beasley  members of his immediate family and affiliated entities that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders now or in the future 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation related party transactions and note to the accompanying financial statements 
future sales by george g 
beasley or members of his family of our class a common stock could adversely affect its market price 
george g 
beasley and members of his family beneficially own the majority of all outstanding shares of class b common stock  which is convertible to class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the market for our class a common stock could change substantially if george g 
beasley and members of his family convert their shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock and then sell large amounts of shares of class a common stock in the public market 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity related securities in the future 
the difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our company may adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
due to his large holdings of our common stock  george g 
beasley controls the decision whether any change of control of the company will occur 
moreover  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control could be beneficial to you 
in addition  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of stations that one individual or entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a market 
fcc approval for transfers of control of fcc licensees and assignments of fcc licenses are also required 
because of the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by these provisions and regulations  the trading price of our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
there may not be an active market for our class a common stock  making it difficult for you to sell your stock 
our stock may not be actively traded in the future 
an illiquid market for our stock may result in price volatility and poor execution of buy and sell orders for investors 
our stock price and trading volume have fluctuated widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to our business or results of operations 
this market volatility could depress the price of our class a common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease  perhaps significantly

financial statement presentation the following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our financial statements and general factors that impact these items 
net revenue 
our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions  generally of gross revenue 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime and digital sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly to the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 

table of contents our net revenue is generally determined by the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels 
advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we use barter sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services  however  we endeavor to minimize barter revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime 
we also continue to invest in digital support services to develop and promote our radio station websites 
we derive revenue from our websites through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  sales  advertising and promotion  and general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
fcc broadcasting licenses 
as of december   fcc broadcasting licenses with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to test our licenses for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our licenses might be impaired 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that our licenses are impaired 
if we determine it is more likely than not that our licenses are impaired then we are required to perform the quantitative impairment test 
the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of our licenses with their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amounts of the licenses exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for the purpose of testing our licenses for impairment  we combine our licenses into reporting units based on our market clusters 
we assessed qualitative factors including cost factors  financial performance  industry and market conditions  and macroeconomic conditions during and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our licenses in atlanta  ga  augusta  ga  boston  ma  fayetteville  nc  fort myers naples  fl  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  miami fort lauderdale  fl  philadelphia  pa  and west palm beach boca raton  fl was less than their respective carrying amounts therefore we did not perform the quantitative impairment test for the licenses in these market clusters in however  due to the amount by which fair value  as determined during the quantitative impairment test performed as of november   exceeded the respective carrying amounts in las vegas  nv and wilmington  de and the recognition of impairment losses in prior years  we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for the licenses in these market clusters in 
table of contents we estimated the fair value of our licenses in las vegas  nv and wilmington  de using an income approach 
the income approach measures the expected economic benefits the licenses provide and discounts these future benefits using discounted cash flow analyses 
the discounted cash flow analyses assume that each license is held by a hypothetical start up radio station and the value yielded by the discounted cash flow analyses represents the portion of the radio station s value attributable solely to its license 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates variables such as radio market revenues  the projected growth rate for radio market revenues  projected radio market revenue share  projected radio station operating income margins  and a discount rate appropriate for the radio broadcasting industry 
the variables used in the analyses reflect historical radio station and market growth trends  as well as anticipated radio station performance  industry standards  and market conditions 
the discounted cash flow projection period of ten years was determined to be an appropriate time horizon for the analyses 
stable market revenue share and operating margins are expected at the end of year three maturity 
as of november   the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses are as follows revenue growth rates market revenue shares at maturity operating income margins at maturity discount rate if we had made different assumptions or used different estimates  the fair value of our licenses could have been materially different 
if actual results are different from assumptions or estimates used in the discounted cash flow analyses  we may incur impairment losses in the future and they may be material 
cash flows and operating income are dependent on advertising revenues 
advertising revenues are influenced by competition from other radio stations and media  demographic changes  and changes in government rules and regulations 
in addition  advertising is generally considered a discretionary expense meaning advertising expenditures tend to decline disproportionately during economic downturns as compared to other types of business expenditures 
if actual results are lower  we may incur impairment losses in the future and they may be material 
the carrying amount of fcc broadcasting licenses for las vegas  nv and wilmington  de and the percentage by which fair value exceeded the carrying amount is as follows market cluster fcc broadcasting licenses excess las vegas  nv wilmington  de as a result of the quantitative impairment test performed for las vegas  nv and wilmington  de in the fourth quarter of  we recorded no impairment losses related to our fcc broadcasting licenses for these reporting units 
however there can be no assurance that impairments of our fcc broadcasting licenses will not occur in future periods 
goodwill 
as of december   goodwill with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill might be impaired 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we are required to perform the first step of a two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then we are required to perform the second step of the two step goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
for the purpose of testing our goodwill for impairment  we have identified our market clusters as our reporting units 
we assessed qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  and overall financial performance in and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than their respective carrying amounts therefore we did not perform the two step impairment test for any of our reporting units in no impairment losses related to our goodwill were recorded in however there can be no assurance that impairments of our goodwill will not occur in future periods 
property and equipment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever an event has occurred that may result in an impairment loss 
if such an event occurs  we will compare estimates of related future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we will reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the determination of when an event has occurred and estimates of 
table of contents future cash flows and fair value all require management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or estimates may result in alternative assessments that could be materially different 
we did not identify any events that may have resulted in an impairment loss on our property and equipment in there can be no assurance that impairment of our property and equipment will not occur in future periods 
accounts receivable 
we continually evaluate our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
our ongoing evaluation includes review of specific accounts at our radio stations  the current financial condition of our customers and our historical write off experience 
this ongoing evaluation requires management judgment and if we had made different assumptions about these factors  the allowance for doubtful accounts could have been materially different 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key financial measures 
these changes illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below

corporate general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  were comparable to the same period in interest expense 
interest expense decreased million during the year ended december  significant factors affecting interest expense included a decrease in long term debt outstanding  the expiration of interest rate swap agreements in the first and third quarters of  and an increase in borrowing costs under our new credit agreements 
loss on extinguishment of long term debt 
we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of long term debt related to our new credit agreements in the third quarter of income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was approximately for the years ended december  and which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
net income 
net income increased million during the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit loan 
our primary liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and radio station acquisitions 
historically  our capital expenditures have not been significant 
in addition to property and equipment associated with radio station acquisitions  our capital expenditures have generally been  and are expected to continue to be  related to the maintenance of our studio and office space and the technological improvement  including upgrades necessary to broadcast hd radio  and maintenance of our broadcasting towers and equipment 
we have also purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations 
our credit agreements permit us to pay cash dividends and to repurchase additional shares of our common stock  subject to compliance with financial covenants  up to an aggregate amount of million for the period from august  to december   million for  million for each of and  and million for each year thereafter 
on december   our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per each share on our class a and class b common stock 
the one time special dividend of million in the aggregate was paid on december  to stockholders of record on december  we paid million to repurchase  shares of our class a common stock in we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted thereunder  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the next twelve months 
however  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to defaults under our credit facilities  additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect and we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
our ability to reduce our consolidated total debt ratio  as defined by our credit agreements  by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under our revolving credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our consolidated total debt ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity
