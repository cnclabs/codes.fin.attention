average polyester raw material costs for fiscal year declined approximately per pound from the average costs for fiscal year the gap in polymer pricing between the us and asia was approximately per pound for the quarter ended june  and has been above per pound for seven consecutive quarters 
the company expects the gap during fiscal year to remain at or near the level of fiscal year this raw material price gap  along with cheap import pricing  continues to place sales volume and margin pressure on the low end of the company s product offering that typically competes with imported polyester yarns
