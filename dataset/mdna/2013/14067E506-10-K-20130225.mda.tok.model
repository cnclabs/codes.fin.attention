item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview capstead operates as a self managed reit and earns income from investing in a leveraged portfolio of residential mortgage pass through securities consisting almost exclusively of arm agency securities  which are considered to have limited  if any  credit risk 
capstead finances its investments with borrowings under repurchase arrangements with commercial banks and other financial institutions supported by its long term investment capital  which as of december  totaled billion and consisted of billion of common and million of perpetual preferred stockholders equity recorded amounts and million of long term unsecured borrowings net of related investments in statutory trusts 
long term investment capital increased by million or during primarily as a result of higher portfolio pricing levels and raising million in new common equity capital  before the repurchase of million in common shares late in the year 
holdings of arm agency securities increased billion or during  to billion at december   while repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings increased billion or to billion 
portfolio leverage repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings divided by long term investment capital decreased to to one by december  from to one at december  management believes borrowing at current levels represents an appropriate and prudent use of leverage for a portfolio of agency securities under current market conditions  particularly a portfolio consisting almost entirely of short duration arm agency securities duration is a common measure of market price sensitivity to interest rate movements 
provided capital can continue to be deployed at attractive levels and financing conditions remain favorable  management currently anticipates maintaining portfolio leverage near december  levels 
capstead reported net income of million or per diluted common share for the year ended december   compared to million or per diluted common share in net income per diluted common share declined year over year  even as net income increased  reflecting a increase in average common shares outstanding resulting from raising million in new common equity capital during the past two years 
financing spreads on residential mortgage investments averaged basis points during  an decline from basis points reported for lower financing spreads during reflect a lower cash yields on the portfolio because of the effects of arm loan coupon interest rates underlying the portfolio resetting lower to more current rates as well as lower coupon interest rates on acquisitions  and b higher investment premium amortization primarily because of higher levels of mortgage prepayments as well as higher prices paid for portfolio acquisitions in recent years 
the effect on financing spreads of lower portfolio yields in was not offset by lower borrowing rates as the benefits of replacing expiring higher cost interest rate swap agreements with additional two year term swap agreements at more favorable rates were offset by increases in unhedged borrowing rates 
operating costs as a percentage of average long term investment capital declined basis points to during reflecting both increases in long term investment capital and lower performance based compensation costs 
the size and composition of capstead s investment portfolio depends on investment strategies being implemented by management  as well as overall market conditions  including the availability of attractively priced investments and suitable financing to leverage the company s investment capital 
market conditions are influenced by  among other things  current levels of  and expectations for future levels of  short term interest rates  mortgage prepayments and market liquidity 

table of contents risk factors and critical accounting policies under the captions risk factors and critical accounting policies are discussions of risk factors and critical accounting policies affecting capstead s financial condition and earnings that are an integral part of this discussion and analysis 
readers are strongly urged to consider the potential impact of these factors and accounting policies on the company and its financial results 
equity capital issuances and common share repurchases during the first three quarters of capstead raised million in new common equity capital by issuing million common shares at an average price of per share  after underwriting discounts and offering expenses  through the company s at the market continuous offering program 
additionally  through april the company raised million in new preferred equity capital under this program 
on october  the company announced a million common share repurchase program and suspended its continuous offering program until further notice 
purchases made pursuant to the common share repurchase program can be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
the timing  manner  price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the company in its discretion and are subject to economic and market conditions  share price  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
pursuant to this authorization  repurchases nearly all of which were made in november totaled million common shares at an average cost of per share for million by year end 
an additional  shares were repurchased in early january at an average cost of per share for million 
at february   million of the repurchase authorization remains available 
the authorization does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common shares and the program may be suspended or discontinued at the company s discretion without prior notice 
upon suspension of the repurchase program  issuances of common shares under the continuous offering program or by other means may resume subject to compliance with federal securities laws  market conditions and blackout periods associated with the dissemination of earnings and dividend announcements and other important company specific news 
book value per common share the following table illustrates the progression of capstead s book value per common share for the three years ended december  book value per common share  beginning of year capital transactions accretion from capital raises accretion from stock repurchases dividend distributions in excess of less than earnings increase in fair value of mortgage securities classified as available for sale decrease increase in fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings unsecured borrowings book value per common share  end of year increase in book value per common share during the indicated year all but million of capstead s billion of residential mortgage investments and all of its interest rate swap agreements are reflected at fair value on the company s balance sheet and included in the calculation of book value per common share total stockholders equity  less perpetual preferred share liquidation preferences  divided by common shares outstanding 
the fair value of these investments is 
table of contents impacted by market conditions  including changes in interest rates  and the availability of financing at reasonable rates and leverage levels 
the company s investment strategy attempts to mitigate these risks by focusing on investments in agency securities  which are considered to have little  if any  credit risk and are collateralized by arm loans with interest rates that reset periodically to more current levels 
because of these characteristics  the fair value of capstead s portfolio is considerably less vulnerable to significant pricing declines caused by credit concerns or rising interest rates compared to portfolios containing a significant amount of non agency and or fixed rate mortgage securities 
residential mortgage investments capstead s investment strategy focuses on managing a large portfolio of residential mortgage investments consisting almost exclusively of arm agency securities 
agency securities are considered to have limited  if any  credit risk because the timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the gses  which are federally chartered corporations  or ginnie mae  which is an agency of the federal government 
federal government support for the gses has largely alleviated market concerns regarding the ability of the gses to fulfill their guarantee obligations 
by focusing on investing in relatively short duration arm agency securities  declines in fair value caused by increases in interest rates are typically relatively modest compared to investments in longer duration  fixed rate assets 
these declines can be recovered in a relatively short period of time as coupon interest rates on the underlying mortgage loans reset to rates more reflective of the then current interest rate environment allowing for the potential recovery of financing spreads diminished during periods of rising interest rates 
the following table illustrates the progression of the company s portfolio of residential mortgage investments for the three years ended december  in thousands residential mortgage investments  beginning of year increase in unrealized gains on mortgage securities classified as available for sale portfolio acquisitions principal amount at average lifetime purchased yields of  and  respectively securities effectively sold in connection with the bankruptcy of a lending counterparty investment premiums on acquisitions portfolio runoff principal amount investment premium amortization residential mortgage investments  end of year arm securities are backed by residential mortgage loans that have coupon interest rates that adjust at least annually to more current interest rates or begin doing so after an initial fixed rate period 
after the initial fixed rate period  if applicable  mortgage loans underlying the company s arm securities either i adjust annually based on specified margins over the one year constant maturity us treasury note rate cmt or the one year london interbank offered rate libor  ii adjust semiannually based on specified margins over six month libor  or iii adjust monthly based on specified margins over indices such as one month libor  the eleventh district federal reserve bank cost of funds index  or over a rolling twelve month average of the one year cmt index  usually subject to periodic and lifetime limits  or caps  on the amount of such adjustments during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the contractual term of the underlying loans 
capstead classifies its arm securities based on the average length of time until the loans underlying each security reset to more current rates months to roll less than months for current reset arm securities  and months or greater for longer to reset arm securities 
after consideration of any applicable initial fixed rate periods  at december  approximately  and of the

approximately of the company s current reset arm securities have reached an initial coupon reset date  while none of its longer to reset arm securities have reached an initial coupon reset date 
additionally  at december  approximately of the company s arm securities were backed by interest only loans that have not reached an initial coupon reset date 
all percentages are approximate and based on averages of the characteristics of mortgage loans underlying each security and calculated using unpaid principal balances as of the indicated date

b net wac  or weighted average coupon  is the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans underlying the indicated investments  net of servicing and other fees as of the indicated date 
net wac is expressed as a percentage calculated on an annualized basis on the unpaid principal balances of the underlying mortgage loans 
fully indexed wac represents the weighted average coupon upon one or more resets using interest rate indexes and net margins as of the indicated date 
average net margins represent the weighted average levels over the underlying indexes that the portfolio can adjust to upon reset  usually subject to initial  periodic and or lifetime limits  or caps  on the amount of such adjustments during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the contractual term of the underlying loans 
arm securities issued by the gses with initial fixed rate periods of five years or longer typically have basis point initial caps with basis point periodic caps 
additionally  certain arm securities are subject only to lifetime caps or are not subject to a cap 
for presentation purposes  average periodic caps reflect initial caps until after an arm security has reached its initial reset date and lifetime caps  less the current net wac  for arm securities subject only to lifetime caps 
at year end  of current reset arms were subject to periodic caps averaging  were subject to initial caps averaging  were subject to lifetime caps  less the current net wac  averaging  and were not subject to a cap 
all longer to reset arm securities at december  were subject to initial caps 
c gross wac is the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans underlying the company s arm holdings  including servicing and other fees paid by borrowers  as of the indicated balance sheet date 
arm agency securities typically are acquired at a premium to the securities unpaid principal balances and high levels of mortgage prepayments can put downward pressure on yields and financing spreads because the level of mortgage prepayments impacts how quickly investment premiums are written off against earnings as portfolio yield adjustments 
during the year ended december  mortgage prepayments  expressed as a constant prepayment rate  or cpr  averaged on an annualized basis compared to a cpr of in higher mortgage prepayment levels  particularly during the second half of  primarily reflects lower prevailing mortgage interest rates available to consumers 
while the current low interest rate environment can be expected to persist for some time  certain characteristics of the company s portfolio moderate the risk of experiencing prepayment levels sharply higher than the levels experienced the second half of a key differentiating factor of capstead s investment strategy relative to the strategies implemented by peers in the mortgage reit sector is the company s focus on investing solely in short duration arm securities 
approximately of the mortgages underlying the company s current reset arm securities were originated prior to and 
table of contents carry coupon interest rates at or below prevailing fixed mortgage rates diminishing the economic advantage  if any  of refinancing 
additionally  refinancing for many of these homeowners continues to be hampered by low housing prices and credit problems 
newer originations  primarily held in the company s longer to reset portfolio  remain more susceptible to refinancing because it is easier for many of these borrowers to qualify for new mortgages and it may be more attractive to do so from a rate perspective in the current low mortgage interest rate environment 
on an overall basis  management expects mortgage prepayment levels to remain manageable in absent additional government intervention to lower mortgage interest rates beyond the federal reserve s current bond buying program 
this should help contain investment premium amortization costs  which increased by million in to million 
capstead generally pledges its residential mortgage investments as collateral under repurchase arrangements with commercial banks and other financial institutions  referred to as counterparties  the terms and conditions of which are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis when each borrowing is initiated or renewed 
none of the company s counterparties are obligated to renew or otherwise enter into new repurchase transactions at the conclusion of existing repurchase transactions 
repurchase arrangements entered into by the company involve the sale and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the transferred assets at a future date  typically with terms of to days  and are accounted for as financings by the company 
the company maintains the beneficial interest in the specific securities pledged during the term of the repurchase arrangement and receives the related principal and interest payments 
the amount borrowed is generally equal to the fair value of the assets pledged  as determined by the lending counterparty  less an agreed upon discount  referred to as a haircut 
haircut requirements for pledged agency securities have remained relatively stable since early in and as of december   haircuts on outstanding borrowings averaged percent and ranged from to percent of the fair value of the pledged securities 
after considering haircuts and related interest receivable on the collateral  as well as interest payable on these borrowings  the company had million of capital at risk with its lending counterparties as of december  interest rates charged on repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings are fixed based on prevailing rates corresponding to the terms of the borrowings  and interest is paid at the termination of the repurchase arrangement at which time the company may enter into a new repurchase arrangement at prevailing market rates with the same counterparty or repay that counterparty and negotiate financing with a different counterparty 
when the fair value of pledged securities declines due to changes in market conditions or the publishing of monthly security pay down factors  lenders typically require the company to post additional securities as collateral  pay down borrowings or establish cash margin accounts with the counterparties in order to re establish the agreed upon collateral requirements  referred to as margin calls 
conversely  if collateral fair values increase  lenders are required to release collateral back to the company pursuant to company issued margin calls 
the company s borrowings under repurchase arrangements and similar borrowings at december  consisted of billion of primarily day borrowings with counterparties at average rates of  before the effects of interest rate swap agreements held as cash flow hedges see below and including the effects of these derivative financial instruments 
to help mitigate exposure to higher short term interest rates  capstead typically uses currently paying and forward starting  one month libor indexed  pay fixed  receive variable  interest rate swap agreements that require interest payments for two year terms 
variable payments received by the company under these swap agreements largely offset interest accruing on a like amount of the company s to day borrowings  leaving the fixed rate payments to be paid on the swap agreements as the company s effective borrowing rate  subject to certain adjustments 
these adjustments include the effects of measured hedge ineffectiveness and changes in spreads between variable rates on the swap agreements and related actual borrowing rates 
under the terms of currently paying interest rate swap agreements held at december   the company is required to pay fixed rates of interest averaging on notional amounts totaling billion with average remaining interest payment terms of nine months 

table of contents additionally  as of year end the company had entered into forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling billion that will begin requiring interest payments at fixed rates averaging for two year periods that commence on various dates between january and december  with an average expiration of months 
after consideration of all swap positions entered into as of year end to hedge short term borrowing rates  the company s residential mortgage investments and related borrowings under repurchase arrangements had estimated durations at december  of months and months  respectively  for a net duration gap of approximately months see pages and under the caption interest rate risk for further information 
the company intends to continue to manage interest rate risk associated with holding and financing its residential mortgage investments by utilizing suitable derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements as well as longer dated repurchase arrangements if available at attractive terms

both are expressed as a percentage calculated on an annualized basis on average amortized cost basis for the indicated periods 
b unhedged borrowing rates represent average rates on repurchase agreements and similar borrowings 
fixed swap rates represent the average fixed rates on currently paying interest rate swap agreements used to hedge short term borrowing rates 
adjusted borrowing rates reflect unhedged borrowing rates and fixed swap rates after adjustments for differences between variable rate payments received on currently paying swap agreements  which typically are based on one month libor  as well as any measured hedge ineffectiveness  calculated on an annualized basis on average outstanding balances for the indicated periods 
financing spreads on residential mortgage investments  a non gaap financial measure  differs from total financing spreads  an all inclusive gaap measure  that is based on all interest earning assets and all interest paying liabilities 
the company believes that presenting financing spreads on residential mortgage investments provides useful information for evaluating the performance of the company s portfolio 
the following tables reconcile these two measures q q q q q q q q financing spreads on residential mortgage investments impact of yields on other interest earning assets impact of borrowing rates on unsecured borrowings and other interest paying liabilities total financing spreads

quarter over quarter declines in cash yields moderated to only three basis points during the first and second quarters of as the coupon interest rates on an increasing number of mortgage loans underlying the company s holdings of current reset arm securities approached fully indexed levels 
however  during the third and fourth quarters of cash yields declined six and five basis points  respectively  in part due to recent declines in underlying indices  principally six and twelve month libor 
further declines in weighted average coupons should be muted given that these indices have largely returned to the lower levels prevailing in late investment premium amortization is influenced by mortgage prepayment and investment premium levels 
because of higher prices paid in recent years for acquisitions as well as runoff of older  lower basis securities  the company s cost basis in its portfolio expressed as a ratio of amortized cost basis to unpaid principal balance increased and basis points during and  respectively  to at december  from at the beginning of a higher cost basis in the portfolio has contributed to larger yield adjustments for investment premium amortization over time 
however  the primary reason for increasing yield adjustments for investment premium amortization during was higher mortgage prepayment levels  particularly in the second half of the year  primarily due to lower prevailing mortgage interest rates 
unhedged borrowing rates increased during from the lower levels experienced during due to a variety of market factors and were at the highest levels of the year for repurchase arrangements extending past december  by february  rates had largely receded to third quarter levels 
fixed swap rates trended lower the last several years with the expiration of higher rate interest rate swap agreements 
this trend is expected to continue in with billion of the company s currently paying interest rate swaps with average fixed rates of terminating by early december these swaps have already largely been replaced at significantly lower rates 
for instance  during the first quarter of  billion of currently paying swaps with average fixed rates of will terminate and billion of forward starting swaps with fixed rates of will begin their two year payment periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this report for further information regarding the company s currently paying and forward starting swap agreements 
commercial investments in management curtailed its previous practice of periodically augmenting capstead s residential mortgage investments with investments in credit sensitive commercial real estate related assets 
the company s remaining exposure to these non core investments was eliminated by july through sales of the underlying collateral 
the company remains a subordinated participant in the lending group for the four seasons resort in nevis  west indies  which was foreclosed on in may the company wrote off its related million investment in a recovery on this investment  if any  would come from the eventual disposition of the resort by the lending group 

table of contents utilization of long term investment capital and potential liquidity capstead s investment strategy is to manage a conservatively leveraged portfolio of arm agency securities that can produce attractive risk adjusted returns over the long term  while reducing  but not eliminating  sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
borrowings under repurchase arrangements generally can be increased or decreased on a daily basis to meet cash flow requirements and otherwise manage capital resources efficiently 
consequently  potential liquidity inherent in the company s unencumbered residential mortgage investments is as important as the actual level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet 
potential liquidity is affected by  among other things  current portfolio leverage levels  changes in market value of assets pledged and interest rate swap agreements held for hedging purposes as determined by lending and swap counterparties  principal prepayments  collateral requirements of lenders and swap counterparties  and general conditions in the commercial banking and mortgage finance industries 
future levels of portfolio leverage will be dependent upon many factors  including the size and composition of the company s investment portfolio see liquidity and capital resources 
the company s utilization of its long term investment capital and its estimated potential liquidity were as follows as of december  in comparison with december  in thousands investments a related borrowings capital employed potential liquidity b portfolio leverage c balances as of december  residential mortgage investment portfolio cash collateral receivable from swap counterparties  net d other assets  net of other liabilities balances as of december  a investments are stated at balance sheet carrying amounts  which generally reflect estimated fair value as of the indicated date 
b potential liquidity is based on maximum amounts of borrowings available under existing uncommitted repurchase arrangements considering management s estimate of the fair value of related collateral as of the indicated dates adjusted for other sources of liquidity such as cash and cash equivalents 
c portfolio leverage is expressed as the ratio of repurchase agreements and similar borrowings related borrowings in the table above to long term investment capital total capital employed in the table above 
d cash collateral receivable from swap counterparties is presented net of cash collateral payable to swap counterparties  if applicable  and the fair value of interest rate swap positions as of the indicated date 
in order to prudently and efficiently manage its liquidity and capital resources  capstead attempts to maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to fund borrowing and interest rate swap program related margin calls under stressed market conditions  including margin calls resulting from monthly principal payments remitted to the company to days after any given month end  as well as reasonably possible declines in the market value of pledged assets and swap positions 
should market conditions deteriorate  management may reduce portfolio leverage and therefore increase liquidity by raising new equity capital  selling mortgage securities and or curtailing the replacement of portfolio runoff 
additionally  the company routinely does business with a large number of lending counterparties  which bolsters financial flexibility to address challenging market conditions and limits exposure to any individual counterparty 
the company has maintained portfolio leverage at approximately eight to one since early which management believes represents an appropriate and prudent use of leverage for a portfolio of agency securities under current market conditions  particularly a portfolio consisting almost entirely of short duration arm agency securities

financing spreads on residential mortgage 
table of contents investments averaged during  a decline from spreads of reported for lower financing spreads in reflect lower cash yields on the portfolio because of the effects of arm loan coupon interest rates underlying the portfolio resetting lower to more current rates as well as lower coupon interest rates on acquisitions 
amortization of investment premiums had less of an impact on yields in because mortgage prepayment rates were lower in compared to relatively high levels experienced as a consequence of gse programs to buy out backlogs of seriously delinquent loans from their guarantee portfolios during the effect on financing spreads of lower portfolio yields was partially offset by lower borrowing rates resulting from replacing expiring higher cost interest rate swap agreements with additional two year term swap agreements at more favorable rates

table of contents liquidity and capital resources capstead s primary sources of funds are borrowings under repurchase arrangements and monthly principal and interest payments on its investments 
other sources of funds may include proceeds from debt and equity offerings and asset sales 
the company generally uses its liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage its long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can generally be adjusted on a daily basis  the company s potential liquidity inherent in its unencumbered residential mortgage investments is as important as the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet 
the table included under financial condition utilization of long term investment capital and potential liquidity and accompanying discussion illustrates management s estimate of additional funds potentially available to the company as of december  and the company s perspective on the appropriate level of portfolio leverage to employ under current market conditions 
the company currently believes that it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments when considered appropriate  any additional common share repurchases  repayments on borrowings and the payment of cash dividends as required for the company s continued qualification as a reit 
it is the company s policy to remain strongly capitalized and conservatively leveraged 
capstead generally pledges its residential mortgage investments as collateral under repurchase arrangements  the terms and conditions of which are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis with commercial banks and other financial institutions  referred to as counterparties  when each borrowing is initiated or renewed 
none of the company s counterparties are obligated to renew or otherwise enter into new repurchase transactions at the conclusion of existing repurchase transactions 
as of december   the company had uncommitted repurchase facilities with a variety of lending counterparties to finance its portfolio  subject to certain conditions  and had borrowings outstanding with of these counterparties 
amounts available to be borrowed under these arrangements are dependent upon the willingness of lenders to participate in the financing of agency securities  lender collateral requirements and the lenders determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates and liquidity conditions within the commercial banking and mortgage finance industries 
borrowings under repurchase arrangements increased to billion at december   primarily with original maturities of days 
total borrowings under repurchase arrangements began the year at billion and averaged billion during average borrowings during the year were lower than at year end primarily due to portfolio growth and differences in the timing of portfolio acquisitions relative to portfolio runoff 
to help mitigate exposure to higher short term interest rates  capstead typically uses currently paying and forward starting  one month libor indexed  pay fixed  receive variable  interest rate swap agreements that require interest payments for two year terms 
at december  currently paying swap agreements entered into by the company had notional amounts totaling billion with average remaining interest payment terms of nine months and were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes of a like amount of the company s to day borrowings under repurchase arrangements 
additionally  at december  the company held forward starting swap agreements for this purpose with notional amounts totaling billion that begin two year interest payment terms on various dates between january and december with an average expiration of months 
relative to the floating rate terms of the company s million in unsecured borrowings that begin at various dates between october and september  the company entered into forward starting swap agreements to effectively lock in fixed rates of interest averaging for the final years of these borrowings that mature in and the company intends to continue to utilize suitable derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 

table of contents during the first three quarters of capstead raised million in new common equity capital after expenses through its at the market  continuous offering program that as of year end had million common shares available for issuance pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the applicable registration statement on file with the sec 
this program was suspended in october with the announcement of a million common share repurchase program 
pursuant to this authorization  the company repurchased million common shares at an average cost of per share for a total cost of million by year end 
an additional  shares were repurchased in early january at an average cost of per share for a total cost of over million 
as of february   million of the repurchase authorization remains 
the authorization does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common shares and the program may be suspended or discontinued at the company s discretion without prior notice 
upon suspension of the repurchase program  issuances of common shares under the continuous offering program or by other means may resume if conditions warrant  subject to compliance with federal securities laws  market conditions and blackout periods associated with the dissemination of earnings and dividend announcements and other important company specific news 
interest rate risk because capstead s residential mortgage investments consist almost entirely of agency securities  which are considered to have limited  if any  credit risk  interest rate risk is the primary market risk faced by the company 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to a number of factors  including economic conditions  government fiscal policy  central bank monetary policy and banking regulation 
by focusing on investing in relatively short duration arm agency securities  declines in fair value caused by increases in interest rates are typically relatively modest compared to investments in longer duration  fixed rate assets 
these declines can be recovered in a relatively short period of time as coupon interest rates on the underlying mortgage loans reset to rates more reflective of the then current interest rate environment allowing for the potential recovery of financing spreads diminished during periods of rising interest rates 
to further mitigate capstead s exposure to higher short term interest rates  the company currently uses interest rate swap agreements that typically require interest payments for two year terms in order to lengthen the effective duration of its borrowings to more closely match the duration of its investments 
duration is a measure of market price sensitivity to interest rate movements 
after consideration of all swap positions entered into as of quarter end to hedge short term borrowing rates  the company s residential mortgage investments and related borrowings under repurchase arrangements had estimated durations at december  of months and months  respectively  for a net duration gap of approximately months 
the company intends to continue to manage interest rate risk associated with holding and financing its residential mortgage investments by utilizing suitable derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements as well as longer dated repurchase arrangements if available at attractive terms 
capstead performs sensitivity analyses using a model to estimate the effects that specific interest rate changes can reasonably be expected to have on net interest margins and portfolio values 
all investments  related borrowings and derivative financial instruments held are included in these analyses 
for net interest margin modeling purposes  the model incorporates management s assumptions regarding the level of mortgage prepayments for a given interest rate change using market based estimates of prepayment speeds for the purpose of amortizing investment premiums and reinvesting portfolio runoff 
these assumptions are developed through a combination of historical analysis and expectations for future pricing behavior under normal market conditions unaffected by changes in market liquidity 
for portfolio valuation modeling purposes  a static portfolio is assumed 
this modeling is the primary tool used by management to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest margins and portfolio values resulting solely from changes in interest rates 
key modeling assumptions include mortgage prepayment rates  adequate levels of market liquidity  current market conditions  and portfolio leverage levels 
given the present low level of interest rates  a floor of is assumed 
however  it is assumed that borrowing rates cannot decline beyond a certain level 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as 
table of contents a result  modeling cannot precisely estimate the impact of higher or lower interest rates 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  the magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  other changes in market conditions  changes in management strategies and other factors 
the table below reflects the estimated impact of instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve on net interest margins and the fair value of capstead s portfolio of residential mortgage investments and related derivatives at december  and december   subject to the modeling parameters described above 
federal funds rate year us treasury rate down up up projected month percentage change in net interest margins december  december  projected percentage change in portfolio and related derivative values december  december  sensitivity of net interest margins as well as portfolio and related derivative values to changes in interest rates is determined relative to the actual rates at the applicable date 
note that the projected month net interest margin change is predicated on acquisitions of similar assets sufficient to replace runoff 
there can be no assurance that suitable investments will be available for purchase at attractive prices  if investments made will behave in the same fashion as assets currently held or if management will choose to replace runoff with such assets 
the lower sensitivity of net interest margins in the rates down scenario at december  compared to december  reflects a greater benefit from an expected decline in borrowing costs because of higher prevailing unhedged borrowing rates at december  
table of contents risk factors an investment in securities issued by capstead involves various risks 
an investor should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this document before purchasing the company s securities 
the risks discussed herein can adversely affect the company s business  liquidity  operating results  financial condition and future prospects  causing the market price of the company s securities to decline  which could cause an investor to lose all or part of his her investment 
the risk factors described below are not the only risks that may affect the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company also may adversely affect its business  liquidity  operating results  prospects and financial condition 
risks related to capstead s business monetary policy actions by the federal reserve could adversely affect capstead s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
in order to help support the gses and the housing markets  by early the federal reserve had acquired trillion in agency securities 
in september  in order to promote a stronger economic recovery the federal reserve began extending the average maturity of its holdings of securities by selling treasury securities with maturities of less than three years and purchasing longer dated treasuries 
this program was referred to as operation twist 
also in september  the federal reserve began reinvesting principal payments from existing holdings of agency securities into additional agency securities 
in september  the federal reserve began purchasing additional agency securities at a pace of billion per month and announced it would maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its existing holdings of agency securities 
the federal reserve articulated that these additional purchases of agency securities  referred to as qe  will continue until the labor market improves substantially 
these policy initiatives have put upward pressure on pricing for agency securities resulting in downward pressure on yields on new purchases of agency securities and downward pressure on mortgage interest rates  which generally results in higher mortgage prepayment rates 
the company s net interest margins  and therefore earnings  are being adversely affected over time as the company s existing portfolio runs off and is replaced with higher cost  lower yielding securities 
see discussion below regarding the negative effects of higher mortgage prepayment levels 
in addition  should the federal reserve decide to reduce its holdings of agency securities through asset sales  the pricing of these investments could decline  which could adversely affect the company s liquidity  earnings and book value per common share  as more fully described below 
potential changes in the relationship between the federal government and the gses could adversely affect capstead s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
agency securities are considered to have limited  if any  credit risk because the timely payment of principal and interest on these securities are guaranteed by the gses  or by ginnie mae  an agency of the federal government 
only the guarantee by ginnie mae is explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government 
the high actual or perceived credit quality of agency securities allows the company to finance its portfolio using repurchase arrangements with favorable interest rate terms and margin requirements that otherwise would not be available 
as a result of deteriorating housing market conditions that began in  the gses have incurred substantial losses due to high levels of mortgagor defaults 
in the federal housing finance agency placed the gses into conservatorship  allowing it to operate the gses without forcing them to liquidate 
additionally  the federal government  through the us treasury and the federal reserve  undertook other actions to provide financial support to these entities and the housing market including the acquisition of large holdings of agency securities 
these and other steps taken by the federal government were designed to support market stability and mortgage availability at favorable rates in part by providing additional confidence to investors in agency securities 
there can be no assurance that the federal government s support for the gses and the market for agency securities will continue to be adequate to achieve these goals 

table of contents it is anticipated that over the next several years us policy makers will address what the long term role of the federal government in general  and the gses in particular  will play in the housing markets 
the actual or perceived credit quality of agency securities could be adversely affected by market uncertainty over any legislative or regulatory initiatives that impact the relationship between the gses and the federal government 
a significantly reduced role by the federal government or other changes in the guarantees provided by ginnie mae  the gses or their successors could adversely affect the credit profile and pricing of existing holdings and or future issuances of agency securities and whether the company s strategy of holding a leveraged portfolio of agency securities remains viable  which could adversely affect earnings and book value per common share 
failure of the federal government to reduce future federal budget deficits could adversely impact capstead s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
federal budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of a decrease in the market s perception of the creditworthiness of debt securities issued by or guaranteed by the federal government and of further credit rating agency actions to downgrade the federal government s credit rating 
because market participants rely on the federal government s continued support of the gses  the perception of credit risk associated with agency securities and  therefore  the pricing of existing holdings of agency securities could be adversely affected 
in addition  these circumstances could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty  which may weigh heavily on the global banking system and limit the availability and or terms and conditions of borrowings under repurchase arrangements which could adversely impact the company s liquidity  earnings and book value per common share  as more fully described below 
legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect the availability and or terms and conditions of borrowings under repurchase arrangements and consequently  the company s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
in july the us congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank in order to restrict certain business practices of systemically significant participants in the financial markets  which include many of the company s lending counterparties 
additionally  changes in regulatory capital requirements are being implemented worldwide 
it remains unclear how significant of an impact dodd frank and changes in regulatory capital requirements will have on the financial markets in general and on the company s strategy of holding an appropriately hedged  leveraged portfolio of agency securities 
however  it is possible that the availability and or terms and conditions of borrowings under repurchase arrangements and related derivative financial instruments held for hedging purposes could be adversely affected which could adversely affect the company s liquidity  earnings and book value per common share  as more fully described below 
government supported mortgagor relief programs could adversely affect capstead s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
us policy makers have established programs designed to provide qualified homeowners with assistance in avoiding foreclosure or in qualifying for the refinancing of their existing mortgages  which typically entails the pay off of existing mortgages with any losses absorbed by the gses 
one of these programs  the home affordable refinance program harp  has been revised with the intent of increasing its availability to homeowners who are current on their mortgage payments but whose homes have lost significant value making it difficult to qualify for a new mortgage 
a significant expansion of these mortgagor relief programs  as well as any future legislative or regulatory actions  could significantly increase mortgage prepayments which could reduce the expected life of the company s residential mortgage investments  therefore  actual yields the company realizes on these investments could be lower due to faster amortization of investment premiums which could adversely affect earnings 
a significant expansion of these programs also could adversely affect book value per common share because of the elimination of any unrealized gains on that portion of the portfolio that prepays 
additionally  heightened prepayment exposure due to the real or perceived potential for government intervention could adversely affect pricing for agency securities in general and  as a result  liquidity and book value per common share could be adversely affected due to declines in the fair value of the company s remaining portfolio 

table of contents an increase in prepayments may adversely affect capstead s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
when short and long term interest rates are at nearly the same levels ie  a flat yield curve environment  or when long term interest rates decrease  the rate of principal prepayments on mortgage loans underlying mortgage securities generally increases 
prolonged periods of high mortgage prepayments can significantly reduce the expected life of the company s portfolio of residential mortgage investments  therefore  actual yields the company realizes can be lower due to faster amortization of investment premiums  which could adversely affect earnings 
high levels of mortgage prepayments can lead to larger than anticipated demands on the company s liquidity from its lending counterparties  as more fully described below 
additionally  periods of high prepayments can adversely affect pricing for agency securities in general and  as a result  book value per common share can be adversely affected due to declines in the fair value of the company s remaining portfolio and the elimination of any unrealized gains on that portion of the portfolio that prepays 
changes in interest rates  whether increases or decreases  may adversely affect capstead s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
capstead s earnings depend primarily on the difference between the interest received on its residential mortgage investments and the interest paid on its related borrowings  net of the effect of derivatives held for hedging purposes 
the company typically finances its investments at to day interest rates 
coupon interest rates on only a portion of the arm loans underlying the company s securities reset each month and the terms of these arm loans generally limit the amount of any increases during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the life of a loan 
consequently  interest rates on related borrowings not hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements can rise to levels that may exceed yields on these securities in a rising short term interest rate environment 
this can contribute to lower  or in more extreme circumstances  negative financing spreads and  therefore  adversely affect earnings 
because rising interest rates tend to put downward pressure on financial asset prices  capstead may be presented with substantial margin calls during such periods adversely affecting the company s liquidity 
if the company is unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral  the company s lenders can liquidate the company s collateral  potentially under adverse market conditions  resulting in losses 
at such times the company may determine that it is prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
in addition  lower pricing levels for remaining holdings of residential mortgage investments will lead to declines in book value per common share 
during periods of relatively low short term interest rates  declines in the indices used to determine coupon interest rate resets for arm loans may adversely affect yields on the company s arm securities as the underlying arm loans reset at lower rates 
if declines in these indices exceed declines in the company s borrowing rates  earnings would be adversely affected 
periods of illiquidity in the mortgage markets may reduce amounts available to be borrowed under capstead s repurchase arrangements due to declines in the perceived value of related collateral  which could adversely impact the company s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
capstead generally finances its residential mortgage investments by pledging them as collateral under uncommitted repurchase arrangements  the terms and conditions of which are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis 
the amount borrowed under a repurchase arrangement is limited to a percentage of the estimated market value of the pledged collateral and is specified at the inception of the transaction 
the portion of the pledged collateral held by the lender that is not advanced under the repurchase arrangement is referred to as margin collateral and the resulting margin percentage is required to be maintained throughout the term of the borrowing 
if the perceived market value of the pledged collateral as determined by the company s lenders declines  the company may be subject to margin calls wherein the lender requires the company to pledge additional collateral to reestablish the agreed upon margin percentage 
because market illiquidity tends to put downward pressure on asset prices  capstead may be presented with substantial margin calls during such periods 
if the company is unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral  the company s lenders can liquidate the company s collateral  potentially under adverse market conditions  resulting in losses 
at such times the company may determine that it is 
table of contents prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
in addition  lower pricing levels for remaining holdings of residential mortgage investments will lead to declines in book value per common share 
periods of illiquidity in the mortgage markets may reduce the number of counterparties willing to lend to the company and or the amounts individual counterparties are willing to lend via repurchase arrangements  which could adversely affect the company s liquidity  financial condition and earnings 
for instance  a contraction in market liquidity is possible should europe s sovereign debt problems deteriorate in a disorderly fashion  putting further financial pressures on large european and even domestic commercial banks  many of which are lending counterparties 
capstead enters into repurchase arrangements with numerous commercial banks and other financial institutions  both foreign and domestic  routinely with maturities of to days 
the company s ability to achieve its investment objectives depends on its ability to re establish or roll maturing borrowings on a continuous basis and none of the company s counterparties are obligated to enter into new repurchase transactions at the conclusion of existing transactions 
if a counterparty chooses not to roll a maturing borrowing  the company must pay off the borrowing  generally with cash available from another repurchase arrangement entered into with another counterparty 
if the company determines that it does not have sufficient borrowing capacity with its remaining counterparties  it could be forced to reduce its portfolio leverage by selling assets under potentially adverse market conditions  resulting in losses 
this risk is increased if capstead relies significantly on any single counterparty for a significant portion of its repurchase arrangements 
an industry wide reduction in the availability of borrowings under repurchase arrangements could adversely affect pricing levels for agency securities leading to further declines in the company s liquidity and book value per common share 
under these conditions  the company may determine that it is prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
in addition  lower pricing levels for remaining holdings of residential mortgage investments will lead to declines in book value per common share 
if capstead is unable to negotiate favorable terms and conditions on future repurchase arrangements with one or more of the company s lending counterparties  the company s liquidity  financial condition and earnings could be adversely impacted 
the terms and conditions of each repurchase arrangement are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis  and these borrowings generally are re established  or rolled  at maturity 
key terms and conditions of each transaction include interest rates  maturity dates  asset pricing procedures and margin requirements 
the company cannot assure investors that it will be able to continue to negotiate favorable terms and conditions on its future repurchase arrangements 
for instance  during periods of market illiquidity or due to perceived credit deterioration of the collateral pledged or the company itself  a lender may require that less favorable asset pricing procedures be employed  margin requirements be increased and or may choose to limit or completely curtail lending to the company 
under these conditions  the company may determine it is prudent to sell assets to improve its ability to pledge sufficient collateral to support its remaining borrowings  which could result in losses 
capstead s use of repurchase arrangements to finance its investments may expose the company to losses if a lending counterparty seeks bankruptcy protection  or otherwise defaults on its obligation to deliver pledged collateral back to the company 
repurchase arrangements involve the sale and transfer of pledged collateral to the lending counterparty and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the transferred assets at a future date 
this may make it difficult for the company to recover its pledged assets if a lender files for bankruptcy or otherwise fails to deliver pledged collateral back to the company and subject the company to losses to the extent of any margin amounts pledged assets in excess of amounts borrowed held by the lending counterparty 
capstead s use of repurchase arrangements to finance its investments may give the company s lending counterparties greater rights if the company seeks bankruptcy protection  exposing the company to losses 
borrowings made under repurchase arrangements may qualify for special treatment 
table of contents under the us bankruptcy code 
if the company files for bankruptcy  its lending counterparties could avoid the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code and liquidate pledged collateral without delay  which could result in losses to the extent of any margin amounts held by the lending counterparty 
capstead may sell assets for various reasons  including a change in the company s investment focus  which could increase earnings volatility 
capstead may periodically sell assets to enhance its liquidity during periods of market illiquidity or rising interest rates or the company may change its investment focus requiring it to sell some portion of its existing investments 
gains or losses resulting from any such asset sales  or from terminating any related longer dated repurchase arrangements or interest rate swap agreements  could increase the company s earnings volatility 
capstead may invest in derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements to mitigate or hedge the company s interest rate risk  which may adversely affect the company s liquidity  financial condition or earnings 
the company may invest in such instruments from time to time with the goal of achieving more stable borrowing costs over an extended period 
however  these activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on the company s liquidity  financial condition or earnings 
for instance  the pricing of residential mortgage investments and the pricing of related derivatives may deteriorate at the same time leading to margin calls by counterparties to both the borrowings supporting these investments and the derivatives  adversely impacting the company s liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  counterparties could fail to honor their commitments under the terms of the derivatives or have their credit quality downgraded impairing the value of the derivatives 
in the event of any defaults by counterparties  the company may have difficulty recovering its cash collateral receivable from its counterparties and may not receive payments provided for under the terms of the derivatives and as a result  the company may incur losses 
no such hedging activity can completely insulate the company from the risks associated with changes in interest rates and prepayment rates 
derivative financial instruments held may fail to qualify for hedge accounting introducing potential volatility to capstead s earnings 
the company typically qualifies derivative financial instruments held as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes in order to record the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives as a component of stockholders equity rather than in earnings 
if the hedging relationship for any derivative held ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment for any reason  including failing to meet documentation and ongoing hedge effectiveness requirements  the company would be required to record in earnings the total change in fair value of any such derivative 
in addition the company could elect to no longer avail itself of cash flow hedge accounting for its derivative positions 
such changes could introduce a potentially significant amount of volatility to earnings reported by the company 
the lack of availability of suitable investments at attractive pricing may adversely affect capstead s earnings 
the pricing of investments is determined by a number of factors including interest rate levels and expectations  market liquidity conditions  and competition among investors for these investments  many of whom have greater financial resources and lower return requirements than capstead 
additionally  in recent years the federal government  primarily through the federal reserve  has been an active buyer of agency securities which has had the effect of supporting  if not increasing  pricing for these securities 
to the extent the proceeds from prepayments on capstead s mortgage investments are not reinvested or cannot be reinvested at rates of return at least equal to the rates previously earned on those investments  the company s earnings may be adversely affected 
similarly  if proceeds from capital raising activities are not deployed or cannot be deployed at rates of return being earned on existing capital  earnings may be adversely affected 
capstead cannot assure investors that the company will be able to acquire suitable investments at attractive pricing and in a timely manner to replace portfolio runoff as it occurs or to deploy new capital as it is raised 
neither can the company assure investors that it will maintain the current composition of its investments  consisting primarily of arm agency securities 

table of contents capstead is dependent on its executives and employees and the loss of one or more of its executive officers could harm the company s business and its prospects 
as a self managed reit with full time and three part time employees  capstead is dependent on the efforts of its key officers and employees  most of whom have significant experience in the mortgage industry 
although the company s named executive officers and some of its other employees are parties to severance agreements  the company s key officers and employees are not subject to employment agreements with non compete clauses  nor has capstead acquired key man life insurance policies on any of these individuals 
the loss of any of their services could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
risks related to capstead s status as a reit and other tax matters if capstead does not qualify as a reit  the company will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability 
capstead has elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes and intends to continue to so qualify 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  new tax legislation  administrative guidance or court decisions  in each instance potentially with retroactive effect  could make it more difficult or impossible for the company to qualify as a reit 
if capstead fails to qualify as a reit in any tax year  then the company would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation  which  among other things  means that the company would be unable to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for distribution to stockholders  and the company would not be required to make income distributions  and unless capstead were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  the company would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years and  as a result  the company s cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced during these years 
even if capstead remains qualified as a reit  the company may face other tax liabilities that reduce its earnings 
even if capstead remains qualified for taxation as a reit  the company may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and assets 
for example  the company will be required to pay tax on any undistributed reit taxable income  may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on any tax preference items  and may operate taxable reit subsidiaries subject to tax on any taxable income earned 
complying with reit requirements may limit capstead s ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the code may limit capstead s ability to hedge mortgage securities and related borrowings by requiring it to limit its income in each year from unqualified hedges together with any other income not generated from qualified real estate assets  to no more than of gross income 
in addition  the company must limit its aggregate income from nonqualified hedging transactions  from providing certain services  and from other non qualifying sources to not more than of annual gross income 
as a result  the company may have to limit its use of advantageous hedging techniques 
this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than the company would otherwise incur 
if the company were to violate the or limitations  it may have to pay a penalty tax equal to the amount of gross income in excess of those limitations  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect the profitability of these transactions or activities 
if the company fails to satisfy the reit gross income tests it could lose its reit status for federal income tax purposes unless the failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

table of contents complying with reit requirements may cause capstead to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  capstead must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of its income  the nature and diversification of its assets  the amounts that it distributes to its stockholders  and the ownership of its stock 
the company may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when it does not have funds readily available for distribution 
as a result  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder the company s ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 
complying with reit requirements may force capstead to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
to qualify as a reit  capstead must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of its assets consists of cash  cash items  united states government securities and qualified reit real estate assets 
the remainder of the company s investments in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets generally cannot include more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
in addition  in general  no more than of the value of the company s assets other than government securities and qualified real estate assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer  and no more than of the value of its total securities can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
if the company fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  it must correct such failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter to avoid losing its reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences 
as a result  the company may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
complying with reit requirements may force capstead to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 
as a reit  capstead must distribute at least of its annual taxable income subject to certain adjustments to its stockholders 
to the extent that the company satisfies the distribution requirement  but distributes less than of its taxable income  the company will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income 
in addition  the company will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that it pays out to its stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the federal tax laws 
from time to time  the company may generate taxable income greater than its net income for financial reporting purposes or its taxable income may be greater than the company s cash flow available for distribution to stockholders 
if the company does not have other funds available in these situations  it could be required to borrow funds  sell investments at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds to make distributions sufficient to enable it to pay out enough of its taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax or the excise tax in a particular year 
these alternatives could increase the company s costs and reduce its long term investment capital 
capstead may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of the company s securities 
federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may change at any time 
any such changes in laws or interpretations thereof may apply retroactively and could adversely affect capstead or its stockholders 
capstead cannot predict any impact on the value of its securities from adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes 

table of contents an investment in capstead s securities has various federal  state and local income tax risks that could affect the value of an investor s investment 
the company strongly urges investors to consult their own tax advisor concerning the effects of federal  state and local income tax law on an investment in the company s securities  because of the complex nature of the tax rules applicable to reits and their stockholders 
risk factors related to capstead s corporate structure there are no assurances of capstead s ability to pay dividends in the future 
capstead intends to continue paying quarterly dividends and to make distributions to its stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of the company s taxable income in each year  subject to certain adjustments  is distributed 
this  along with other factors  should enable the company to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the internal revenue code 
however  the company s ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this filing 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon the company s earnings  its financial condition  maintenance of its reit status and such other factors as the board may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of the company s ability to pay dividends in the future 
failure to maintain an exemption from the investment company act of would adversely affect capstead s results of operations 
the investment company act of the act exempts from regulation as an investment company any entity that is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on  and interests in  real estate 
capstead believes that it conducts its business in a manner that allows the company to avoid registration as an investment company under the act 
for over years  the staff of the sec has interpreted the provisions of the act to require  among other things  a reit to maintain at least of its assets directly in qualifying real estate interests and at least of its assets in real estate related assets in order to be exempt from regulation as an investment company 
critical to capstead s exemption from regulation as an investment company is the long standing sec staff interpretation that so called whole loan mortgage securities  in which an investor holds all issued certificates with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans  constitutes a qualifying real estate interest for purposes of the staff s qualifying real estate interest requirement 
conversely  so called partial pool mortgage securities presently do not qualify for purposes of meeting the requirement  although they are considered by the staff to be real estate related assets for purposes of meeting the staff s real estate related asset requirement 
in august  the sec staff issued a request for information concept release no 
ic from industry participants and investors regarding  among other things  its past interpretations of the act real estate exemption  including the interpretations described above  raising concerns that the sec may issue a proposal for rulemaking that could overturn some of the staff s past interpretations regarding the real estate exemption 
if the sec or its staff adopts contrary interpretations of the act and the company and other similar reits become subject to regulation as investment companies  the industry s use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
absent a restructuring of the company s business operations to avoid such regulation  this could require the sale of most of the company s portfolio of agency securities under potentially adverse market conditions resulting in losses and significantly reduce future net interest margins and earnings 
pursuant to capstead s charter  its board of directors has the ability to limit ownership of the company s capital stock  to the extent necessary to preserve its reit qualification 
for the purpose of preserving capstead s reit qualification  the company s charter gives the board the ability to repurchase outstanding shares of capital stock from existing stockholders if the directors determine in good faith that the concentration of ownership by such individuals  directly or indirectly  would cause the company to fail to qualify or be disqualified as a reit 
constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be 
table of contents constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively a greater concentration of the company s outstanding stock than is acceptable for reit purposes  thereby giving the board the ability to repurchase any excess shares 
because provisions contained in maryland law and capstead s charter may have an anti takeover effect  investors may be prevented from receiving a control premium for their shares 
provisions contained in capstead s charter and maryland general corporation law can delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt  which may prevent stockholders from receiving a control premium for their shares 
for example  these provisions may defer or prevent tender offers for the company s common stock or purchases of large blocks of the company s common stock  thereby limiting the opportunities for its stockholders to receive a premium over then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include the following repurchase rights repurchase rights granted to capstead s board in its charter limit related investors  including  among other things  any voting group  from owning common stock if the concentration owned would jeopardize the company s reit status

capstead may change its policies without stockholder approval 
capstead s board and management determine all of its policies  including its investment  financing and distribution policies and may amend or revise these policies at any time without a vote of the company s stockholders 
policy changes could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  the market price of its common and preferred stock or the company s ability to pay dividends or distributions 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon capstead s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including contingencies  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures 
these estimates are based on available internal and market information and appropriate valuation methodologies believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the expected useful lives and carrying values of assets and liabilities which can materially affect the determination of net income and book value per common share 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies in the preparation of capstead s consolidated financial statements that involve the use of estimates requiring considerable judgment amortization of investment premiums on residential mortgage investments investment premiums on residential mortgage investments are recognized in earnings as adjustments to interest income by the interest method over the estimated lives of the related assets 
for most of capstead s residential mortgage investments  estimates and judgments related to future levels of mortgage prepayments are critical to this determination 
mortgage prepayment expectations can change based on how current and projected changes in interest rates impact the economic attractiveness of mortgage refinance opportunities  if available  and other factors such as portfolio composition 
in recent years  the ability of mortgagors to refinance has also been impacted by more stringent loan underwriting practices and lending industry capacity restraints  government sponsored mortgagor relief programs  low housing prices and credit problems being experienced by many of these borrowers 
management estimates mortgage prepayments based on past experiences with specific investments within the portfolio in addition to the factors mentioned above 
should actual prepayment rates differ materially from these estimates  investment premiums would be expensed at a different pace 
fair value and impairment accounting for residential mortgage investments all but million of capstead s residential mortgage investments are held in the form of mortgage securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as such  these unrealized gains and losses enter into the calculation of book value per common share  a key financial metric used by investors in evaluating the company 
fair values fluctuate with current and projected changes in interest rates  prepayment expectations and other 
table of contents factors such as market liquidity conditions 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values  particularly in circumstances of deteriorating credit quality and market liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this report for discussion of how capstead values its residential mortgage investments 
generally  gains or losses are recognized in earnings only if sold  however  if a decline in fair value of a mortgage security below its amortized cost occurs that is determined to be other than temporary  the difference between amortized cost and fair value would be recognized in earnings as a component of other revenue expense if the decline was credit related or it was determined to be more likely than not that the company will incur a loss via an asset sale 
other than temporary impairment of a mortgage security due to other factors would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment 
accounting for derivative financial instruments capstead uses derivatives for risk management purposes 
derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities and carried at fair value and consequently  changes in value of these instruments enter into the calculation of book value per common share 
fair values fluctuate with current and projected changes in interest rates and other factors such as the company s and its counterparties nonperformance risk 
judgment is required to develop estimated fair values 
the accounting for changes in fair value of each derivative held depends on whether it has been designated as an accounting hedge  as well as the type of hedging relationship identified 
to qualify as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes  at the inception of the hedge relationship the company must anticipate and document that the hedge relationship will be highly effective and must monitor ongoing effectiveness on at least a quarterly basis 
as long as the hedge relationship remains effective  the effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recorded in earnings as a component of interest expense 
the effective portion of changes in fair value is reclassified from accumulated comprehensive income to earnings over the term of the derivative primarily in the form of derivative cash flows that are either in excess of or lower than market rates 
changes in fair value of derivatives not held as accounting hedges  or for which the hedge relationship is deemed to no longer be highly effective and as a result hedge accounting is terminated  are recorded in earnings as a component of other revenue expense 
the company currently uses interest rate swap agreements in hedge relationships accounted for as cash flow hedges in order to hedge variability in borrowing rates due to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate related to a designated portion of its current and anticipated future and day borrowings and the year floating rate periods of the company s long term unsecured borrowings 
variable rate payments to be received on the swap agreements and any measured hedge ineffectiveness are recorded in interest expense as an offset to interest owed on the hedged borrowings that reset to market rates generally on a monthly basis while fixed rate swap payments to be made are also recorded in interest expense resulting in an effectively fixed borrowing rate on these borrowings  subject to certain adjustments
