overview tcc designs  manufactures  markets and sells communications security equipment that utilizes various methods of encryption to protect the information being transmitted 
encryption is a technique for rendering information unintelligible  which information can then be reconstituted if the recipient possesses the right decryption key 
the company manufactures several standard secure communications products and also provides custom designed  special purpose secure communications products for both domestic and international customers 
the company s products consist primarily of voice  data and facsimile encryptors 
revenue is generated principally from the sale of these products  which have traditionally been to foreign governments either through direct sale  pursuant to a us government contract  or made as a sub contractor to domestic corporations under contract with the us government 
however  we have also sold these products to commercial entities and us government agencies 
in addition to product sales  we generate revenues from contract engineering services performed for certain government agencies  both domestic and foreign  and commercial entities 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory reserves  receivable reserves  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences may be material 
the accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those listed below 
for a more detailed discussion  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herewith 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable 
title to the product generally passes upon shipment of the product  as the products are shipped fob shipping point  except for certain foreign shipments where title passes upon entry of the product into the first port in the buyer s country 
if the product requires installation to be performed by tcc  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon completion of the installation 
we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized 
we perform funded research and development and technology development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and  in some situations  the payment of a fee 
these contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how actual costs compare with a budget 
revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed 
on fixed price contracts that are expected to exceed one year in duration  revenue is recognized pursuant to the proportional performance method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract 
in each type of contract  we receive periodic progress payments or payments upon reaching interim milestones  and we retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts 
all payments to tcc for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
adjustments are recognized in the period made 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for a product development contract indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded 
any losses incurred in performing funded research and development projects are recognized as funded research and development expenses 
cost of product revenue includes material  labor and overhead 
costs incurred in connection with funded research and development are included in cost of sales 
product development costs are charged to billable engineering services  bid and proposal efforts or support of business development activities  as appropriate 
product development costs charged to billable projects are recorded as cost of sales  engineering costs charged to bid and proposal efforts are recorded as selling expenses  and product development costs charged to business development activities are recorded as marketing expenses 
product development costs consist primarily of personnel costs  outside contractor and engineering services  supplies and materials 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost based on first in  first out fifo to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value based on the estimated selling prices  less the cost to sell of the inventory 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand  as well as historical usage 
due to the custom and specific nature of certain of our products  demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase in excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence  any of which could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and would reduce our reported operating results 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which would reduce net income 

table of contents accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may subject the company to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately million as of september  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operation 
due to the nature of our current operations in foreign countries selling products into these countries with the assistance of local representatives  the company has not been subject to any foreign taxes in recent years and it is not anticipated that we will be subject to foreign taxes in the near future 
stock based compensation we record the compensation expense for all stock based payments based on the grant date fair value 
we expense stock based compensation over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
the choice of a valuation technique  and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions for that technique  involve significant judgments 
these judgments reflect management s assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue  based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
our judgments could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change 
any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
we believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant information available at the time made and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 
results of operations year ended september  as compared to year ended september  net sales net sales for the years ended september  and september  were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
sales for fiscal consisted of  or  from domestic sources and  or  from international customers as compared to fiscal  in which sales consisted of  or  from domestic sources and  or  from international customers 
foreign sales consisted of shipments to five different countries during the year ended september  and seven different countries during the year ended september  a sale is attributed to a foreign country based on the location of the contracting party 
domestic revenue may include the sale of products shipped through domestic resellers or manufacturers to international destinations 
the table below summarizes our principal foreign sales by country saudi arabia egypt jordan other 
table of contents for the year ended september  we derived  in service revenue from the sale of engineering services to select customers 
product sales revenue were derived from the company making the initial shipments  amounting to  to the us army communications and electronics command cecom to upgrade the dsd a sp military bulk encryption system currently in use by the government of egypt during the fourth quarter of the year 
the company also made shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors to supply the secure radio and telephone encryption solutions  and supplied customized cryptographic services and tools  for a domestic prime contractor supporting a government customer in north africa amounting to  during the year 
we also had sales of the company s narrowband radio encryptors to a us radio manufacturer for deployment into afghanistan amounting to  our ethernet ip encryptor for deployment into the middle east amounting to  our link encryptor into the middle east amounting to  a spare parts order shipped to egypt amounting to  and a domestic order for our narrowband radio encryptors amounting to  royalty income for fiscal amounted to revenue for fiscal was primarily derived from the sale of the company s narrowband radio encryptors to a us radio manufacturer for deployment into afghanistan amounting to  and to an additional domestic customer amounting to  in addition we sold our secure telephone  fax  and data encryptors to a foreign customer amounting to  and we had sales of our frame relay and internet protocol encryptor products to three customers amounting to  during the year 
we also had sales of our link encryptors into the middle east for  sold spare parts to three foreign customers amounting to  and shipped our high speed bulk encryptors amounting to  under a contract with a domestic customer 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal year was  a decrease of  or  compared to gross profit of  for fiscal year gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily associated with the sale of lower margin engineering services work during fiscal operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal this decrease of  or  was attributable to a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of  offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of  during the fiscal year 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses during fiscal was attributable to a decrease in product evaluation costs of  as well as decreases in personnel related costs of  travel related costs of  outside consulting costs of  and product demonstration cots of  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in outside commissions and sales and marketing agreements of  new marketing initiatives of  and bid and proposal efforts of  for the year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in personnel related costs of  recruiting fees of  and professional service costs of  for the period 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in charitable contributions of  product development costs for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the winding down of planned major product development projects in fiscal see research and development in item above for further discussion on research and development during fiscal 
the reduction in spending resulted in decreases in outside contractor costs of  and personnel related costs of  there 
table of contents was also a decrease in recruiting costs of  and in project material costs of  during fiscal during the period there was also an increase of billable engineering services work and a decrease in engineering support of business development  which decreased product development costs by  planned major product development projects began winding down in fiscal see research and development in item above for further discussion on research and development during fiscal 
the company actively sells its engineering services in support of funded research and development 
the receipt of these orders is sporadic  although such programs can span over several months 
in addition to these programs  the company invests in research and development to enhance its existing products or to develop new products  as it deems appropriate 
there was  of billable engineering services revenue generated during fiscal and no such revenue generated during fiscal it is anticipated that cash from operations will fund our near term research and development and marketing activities 
we also believe that  in the long term  based on current billable activities  cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the development goals of the company  although we can give no assurances 
although expected to decrease in fiscal  any increase in development activities either billable or new product related will require additional resources  which we may not be able to fund through cash from operations 
in circumstances where resources will be insufficient  the company will look to other sources of financing  including debt and or equity investments 
net income the company generated a net loss of  for fiscal  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal this decrease in net loss is primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses during fiscal the company recorded an income tax benefit of  during fiscal based on its expected effective tax rate of for the fiscal year 
this compares to an income tax benefit of  during fiscal based on its expected effective tax rate of 
the company received a refund of  in connection with an abatement claim from a prior year  which contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal there was uncertainty regarding the outcome of the claim  therefore a benefit was not recorded until fiscal the effects of inflation and changing costs have not had a significant impact on sales or earnings in recent years 
as of september   none of the company s monetary assets or liabilities was subject to foreign exchange risks 
the company usually includes an inflation factor in its pricing when negotiating multi year contracts with customers 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our overall financial condition remains strong 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  totaled  compared with  at september  we continue to have no long term debt 
it is anticipated that our cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our near term research and development and marketing activities 
cash requirements we believe that the combination of existing cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid short term investments  together with future cash to be generated by operations  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
we also believe that  in the long term  an anticipated improvement of business prospects  current billable activities and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s investment in product development  although we can give no assurances 
although expected to decrease in fiscal  any increase in development activities either billable or new product related will require additional resources  which we may not be able to fund through cash from operations 
in circumstances where resources will be insufficient  the company will look to other sources of financing  including debt and or equity investments 

table of contents sources and uses of cash the following table presents our abbreviated cash flows for the years ended september  and september  net loss changes not affecting cash changes in assets and liabilities cash used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of period cash and cash equivalents end of period operating activities the company used approximately  less of cash for operating activities in fiscal than it used for operating activities for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to higher collections of accounts and income taxes receivable  as well as a lower volume of accounts payable and accrued expenses during the year  offset by a slower reduction of inventories 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities during fiscal increased by approximately million to  compared to cash used in investing activities of  during fiscal this change is primarily attributable to the purchase in fiscal of short term investments in marketable securities 
financing activities cash used for financing activities during fiscal decreased to  compared to  fiscal the reduction is primarily due to the suspension of dividend payments in early fiscal debt instruments and related covenants the company maintains a line of credit agreement with bank of america the bank for a line of credit not to exceed the principal amount of  the line is supported by a financing promissory note 
the loan is a demand loan with interest payable at the bank s prime rate plus on all outstanding balances 
the loan is secured by all assets of the company excluding consumer goods and requires the company to maintain its deposit accounts with the bank  as well as comply with certain other covenants 
as a result of the company s failure to comply with its tangible net worth covenant with respect to the line of credit  the parties amended the agreement on february  to lower the tangible net worth requirement 
in addition  the line is now only available to support new letters of credit issued by the company 
future standby letters of credit will be required to be secured with cash 
there were no cash borrowings against the line during the fiscal years ended september  and september  however  a standby letter of credit in the amount of  was issued in december and is secured by the line of credit with the bank 

table of contents backlog backlog at september  and september  amounted to  and  respectively 
the orders in backlog at september  are expected to ship over the next six months depending on customer requirements and product availability 
performance guaranties certain foreign customers require the company to guarantee bid bonds and performance of products sold 
these guaranties typically take the form of standby letters of credit 
guaranties are generally required in amounts of to of the purchase price and last in duration from three months to one year 
at september   the company had two outstanding letters of credit amounting to  one of which is secured by a cash certificate of deposit amounting to  the second in the amount of  is secured by the company s line of credit 
research and development research and development efforts are undertaken by the company primarily on its own initiative 
in order to compete successfully  the company must attract and retain qualified personnel  improve existing products and develop new products 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to hire and train such technical management and sales personnel or successfully improve and develop its products 
during the years ended september  and september   the company spent  and  respectively  on internal product development 
in fiscal  the company s internal product development expenses were lower than prior years but in line with its planned commitment to research and development  and reflected the costs of product testing and production readiness efforts 
it is expected that development expenses in fiscal will be consistent with fiscal levels 
with its planned major product development complete see research and development in item above for further discussion on research and development during fiscal  the company expects to focus technical efforts going forward on three principal areas development of solutions that meet the needs of original equipment manufacturers  product enhancements that include expanded features  planned capability and applications growth  and custom solutions that tailor our products to meet the unique needs of our customers 
the company began pursuing oem technical partnerships in  and these relationships continue to develop albeit at a slower pace than originally projected 
tcc believes that the resulting products will be embedded proprietary encryption solutions that will significantly enhance the value of the oems products and allow tcc encryption to be carried to the market by major equipment providers 
other than those stated above  there are no plans for significant internal product development in fiscal and the company does not anticipate any significant capital expenditures during the year 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements
