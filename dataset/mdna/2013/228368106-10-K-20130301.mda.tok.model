item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share  average settlement cost per asbestos claim  employee  shareholder and statistical data introduction the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of crown holdings  inc the company as of and during the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
business strategy and trends the company strategy is to grow its businesses in targeted international growth markets  while improving operations and results in more mature markets through disciplined pricing  manufacturing and productivity improvements  cost control and careful capital allocation 
in recent years  the company has expanded its beverage can operations in asia  brazil and eastern europe in response to increased unit volume demand driven by increased per capita incomes and consumption  combined with a shift in packaging mix to two piece aluminum beverage cans from other packages 
since the beginning of  the company has commercialized ten new production lines including six new plant startups in asia  brazil and europe 
when fully operational  these facilities are expected to have combined annual production capacity of billion beverage cans to meet expected demand 
in  the company expects to commercialize another billion in annual beverage can production capabilities to meet existing demand in still growing markets in cambodia  china  malaysia  thailand and vietnam 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to implement its expansion plans according to this schedule or at all 
the company continuously monitors these markets and  where necessary  may adjust capital deployment based on economic developments and market by market conditions 
beverage can unit sales volumes in the company mature markets have been stable to slightly declining in north america and slightly increasing in europe 
global food and aerosol can sales unit volumes have been stable to declining in recent years primarily due to lower consumer spending 
while the opportunity for organic volume growth in the company mature markets is not comparable to that in targeted international growth markets  the company continues to generate strong returns on invested capital and significant cash flow from these businesses 
the company monitors capacity across all of its businesses and  where necessary  may take action such as closing a plant or reducing headcount to better manage its costs 
any or all of these actions may result in additional restructuring charges in the future which may be material 
as part of the company efforts to manage increased cost  it attempts to pass through increases in the cost of aluminum and steel to its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover from its customers the impact of any such increased costs 
aluminum and steel prices can be subject to significant volatility and there does not appear to be a consistent and predictable trend in pricing 
the company seeks to increase shareholder value by maximizing operating cash flows which can be reinvested in the business  used for acquisitions  used to repay debt or returned to shareholders through share repurchases or possible future dividends 
in assessing the company performance  the key performance measure used is segment income  a non gaap measure defined by the company as gross profit less selling and administrative expenses

in addition  the company manufacturing facilities are dependent  in varying degrees  upon the availability of water and processed energy  such as natural gas and electricity 
aluminum  a basic raw material used by the company  is subject to the risk of significant price fluctuations which may be hedged by the company through forward commodity contracts 
current contracts involve aluminum forwards with a notional value of and a fair value loss of the maturities of the commodity contracts closely correlate to the anticipated purchases of those commodities 
these contracts are used in combination with commercial supply contracts with customers to manage exposure to price volatility

asbestos liabilities the company s potential liability for asbestos cases is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of forecasting many factors  including the level of future claims  the rate of receipt of claims  the jurisdiction in which claims are filed  the nature of future claims including the seriousness of alleged disease  whether claimants allege first exposure to asbestos before or during and the alleged link to crown cork  the terms of settlements of other defendants with asbestos related liabilities  bankruptcy filings of other defendants which may result in additional claims and higher settlement demands for non bankrupt defendants  potential liabilities for claims filed after the company s ten year projection period and the effect of state asbestos legislation including the validity and applicability of the pennsylvania legislation to non pennsylvania jurisdictions  where the substantial majority of the company s asbestos cases are filed 
see 
note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the provision for asbestos related costs 
at the end of each quarter  the company considers whether there have been any material developments that would cause it to update its asbestos accrual calculations 
absent any significant developments in the asbestos litigation environment in general or with respect to the company specifically  the company updates its accrual calculations in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company s asbestos accrual is an estimate of the amounts expected to be paid over the next ten years including outstanding claims  projected future claims and legal costs 
outstanding claims used in the accrual calculation are adjusted for factors such as claims filed in those states where the company s liability is limited by statute and claims alleging first exposure to asbestos after which are assumed to have no value and claims that have been outstanding for a significant length of time which are assumed to have a nominal value 
projected future claims are calculated based on actual data for the most recent five years 
outstanding and projected claims are multiplied by the average settlement cost of those claims for the most recent five years 
the five year average settlement cost per claim was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase in average settlement cost per claim is primarily explained as follows 
crown cork settlement pool continues to include a higher percentage of claims alleging serious disease primarily mesothelioma and other malignancies which are settled for higher amounts 
in addition  claims alleging serious disease have made up a higher percentage of claims filed and therefore a higher percentage of claims projected into the future 
for example  of the projected claims related to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos before or during and filed in states that have not enacted asbestos legislation   and in  and respectively  relate to claims alleging serious diseases 
crown holdings  inc because the company s asbestos liability is an estimate of the amounts expected to be paid over the next ten years  the company expects to record a charge each year to account for projected claims in the new tenth year 
as claims are not submitted or settled evenly throughout the year  it is difficult to predict at any time during the year whether the number of claims or average settlement cost over the five year period ending december of such year will increase compared to the prior five year period 
in  the company recorded a charge of primarily due to the impact of including an additional year of settlement and legal costs in its projection period and the impact of valuing outstanding and projected claims  which include a higher percentage of claims alleging serious disease  at higher average settlement amounts 
during  and  the company made asbestos related payments of  and  respectively 
if the recent trend of settling a higher percentage of claims alleging serious disease primarily mesothelioma and other malignancies which are settled for higher amounts continues  average settlement costs per claim are likely to increase and  if not offset by a reduction in overall claims and settlements  the company may record additional charges in the future 
a change in either the average cost per claim or the number of projected claims would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by for the following ten year period 
a increase or decrease in these two factors at the same time would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by and  respectively  for the following ten year period 
goodwill impairment the company performs a goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
in accordance with the accounting guidance  the company may first perform a qualitative assessment on none  some  or all of its reporting units to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is necessary 
factors that the company may consider in its qualitative assessment include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  changes in the markets in which the company operates  changes in input costs that may affect earnings and cash flows  trends over multiple periods and the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying amount as determined in the most recent fair value calculation 
the quantitative impairment test involves a number of assumptions and judgments  including the calculation of fair value for the company s identified reporting units 
the company determines the estimated fair value for each reporting unit based on the average of the estimated fair values calculated using market values for comparable businesses and discounted cash flow projections 
the company uses an average of the two methods in estimating fair value because it believes they provide an equal probability of yielding an appropriate fair value for the reporting unit 
the company s estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
under the first method of calculating estimated fair value  the company obtains publicly available trading multiples based on the enterprise value of companies in the packaging industry whose shares are publicly traded 
the company also reviews available information regarding the multiples used in recent transactions  if any  involving transfers of controlling interests in the packaging industry 
the appropriate multiple is applied to the forecasted adjusted ebitda a non gaap item defined by the company as net customer sales  less cost of products sold excluding depreciation and amortization  less selling and administrative expenses of the reporting unit to obtain an estimated fair value 
under the second method  fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and the terminal value at the end of those five years 
the projected cash flows generally include no growth assumption unless there has recently been a material change in the business or a material change is forecasted 
the discount rate used is based on the average weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry  which information is available through various sources 
the terminal value at the end of the five years is the product of the forecasted adjusted ebitda at the end of the five year period and the trading multiple 
the company used an ebitda multiple of times and a discount rate of in its review 
the assumed ebitda multiple increased from the times used in due to increased multiples of recent transactions in the industry 
the discount rate decreased from the used in due to a decrease in the weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry 
the company completed its annual review for and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary 
although no goodwill impairment was recorded  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
based upon the company s qualitative and quantitative assessment including consideration of the sensitivity of the assumptions made and methods used to determine fair value  industry trends and other relevant factors  the company did not have any reporting unit at the end of whose fair value did not materially exceed its carrying value except for its european aerosols reporting unit 
crown holdings  inc as of december   the estimated fair value of the european aerosols reporting unit  using the methods and assumptions described above  was higher than its carrying value  and the reporting unit had of goodwill 
the maximum potential effect of weighting the two valuation methods other than equally would have been to increase or decrease the estimated fair value by assuming all other factors remain the same  a change in forecasted annual adjusted ebitda changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by  a change of in the assumed ebitda multiple changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by  and an increase in the discount rate from to changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by the projections used in the company analysis did not assume a significant recovery in sales unit volumes in but  did assume that the company will be able to realize the anticipated savings from its headcount and capacity reductions initiated in the fourth quarter of if future operating results were to decline causing the estimated fair value to fall below its carrying value  it is possible that an impairment charge of up to could be recorded 
long lived assets impairment the company performs an impairment review of its long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance  economic conditions and technological changes that may affect the future useful lives of the assets 
these estimates may differ from actual cash flows or useful lives 
tax valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of the tax assets will not be realized 
the estimate of the amount that will not be realized requires the use of assumptions concerning the company s future taxable income 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the company considers all sources of taxable income in estimating its valuation allowances  including taxable income in any available carry back period  the reversal of taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and taxable income expected to be generated in the future other than reversing temporary differences 
should the company change its estimate of the amount of its deferred tax assets that it would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the period such a change in estimate was made 
see 
note w to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s valuation allowances 
unrecognized tax positions the company recognizes the impact of a tax position if  in the company s opinion  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of that position 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the determination of whether the impact should be recognized  and the measurement of the impact  can require significant judgment and the company s estimate may differ from actual settlement amounts 
see 
note w to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s tax positions 
pension and postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  mortality and employee turnover 
actual results may differ from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pensions or postretirement benefits 
the company recorded pension expense of in and currently projects its pension expense to be using foreign currency exchange rates in effect at december  the rate of return assumptions are reviewed at each measurement date based on the pension plans investment policies  current asset allocations and an analysis of the historical returns of the capital markets 
the us plan s assumed rate of return was in and is in the uk plan s assumed rate of return was in and is in the assumed rate of return for was calculated on a similar basis to as described in 
note v to the consolidated financial statements 
a change in the expected rates of return would change pension expense by approximately crown holdings  inc discount rates were selected using a method that matches projected payouts from the plans with zero coupon aa bond yield curves in the respective currencies 
the yield curves were constructed from the underlying bond price and yield data collected as of the plans measurement date and are represented by a series of annualized  individual discount rates with durations ranging from six months to thirty years 
each discount rate in the curve was derived from an equal weighting of the aa bond universe  apportioned into distinct maturity groups 
these individual discount rates were then converted into a single equivalent discount rate 
to assure that the resulting rates can be achieved by the plan  only bonds with sufficient capacity that satisfy certain criteria and are expected to remain available through the period of maturity of the plan benefits were used to develop the discount rate 
a change in the discount rates from those used at december  would change pension expense by approximately and postretirement expense by approximately a change in the discount rates from those used at december  would have changed the pension benefit obligation by approximately and the postretirement benefit obligation by as of december  see 
note v to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions 
as of december   the company had pre tax unrecognized net losses in other comprehensive income of  related to its pension plans and a net gain of related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
unrecognized gains and losses arise each year primarily due to changes in discount rates  differences in actual plan asset returns compared to expected returns  and changes in actuarial assumptions such as mortality 
for example  the unrecognized net loss in the company s pension plans included a current year gain of due to actual asset returns greater than expected returns and a loss of primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of compared to unrecognized gains and losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income and the portion in each plan that exceeds of the greater of that plan s assets or projected benefit obligation is amortized to income over future periods 
the company s pension expense for the year ended december  included charges of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates charges of in the unrecognized net losses in the pension plans as of december  include  in the uk defined benefit plan   in the u 
s defined benefit plans and in the canadian defined benefit plans 
amortizable losses in the uk plan are being recognized over years  representing the average expected life of inactive employees as over of the plan participants are inactive and the fund is closed to new participants 
amortizable losses in the us plans are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
amortizable losses in the canadian plans are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
an increase of in the number of years used to amortize unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease estimated charges for by a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by unrecognized net loss of in the company s other postretirement benefit plans as of december   primarily include in the us plans  with the amortizable portion being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
the company s other postretirement benefits expense for the year ended december  included a loss of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates losses of in an increase of in the number of years used to amortize the unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease the estimated charge for by a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by recent accounting guidance in december  the fasb issued changes to the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities 
these changes require an entity to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the enhanced disclosures are intended to enable users of an entity s financial statements to understand and evaluate the effect or potential effect of master netting arrangements on an entity s financial position  including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments 
these changes will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after january  accordingly  these changes will first impact the company disclosures for the period ended march  in february  the fasb issued changes to the disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the changes require an entity to present in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
if a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
these changes will be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  accordingly  these changes will first impact the company disclosures for the period ended march  see
