item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income  the monthly dividend company  is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations 
our monthly distributions or dividends are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to commercial enterprises 
we have in house acquisition  leasing  legal  credit research  real estate research  portfolio management and capital markets expertise 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long term lease agreements 
in  realty income was listed upon the new york stock exchange and we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 
we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio of  properties  with an occupancy rate of  or  properties leased and only properties available for lease  leased to different commercial enterprises doing business in separate industries  located in states  with over million square feet of leasable space  and with an average leasable space per property of approximately  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant properties  and the remaining are multi tenant properties 
at december   of the  single tenant properties   were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately years 
liquidity and capital resources capital philosophy historically  we have met our long term capital needs by issuing common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes and bonds 
over the long term  we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure 
however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 
our primary cash obligations  for the current year and subsequent years  are included in the table of obligations  which is presented later in this section 
we expect to fund our operating expenses and other short term liquidity requirements  including property acquisitions and development costs  payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness  property improvements  re leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders  primarily through cash provided by operating activities  borrowing on our billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 

table of contents conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at december   our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds  mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were billion  or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 
we define our total market capitalization at december  as the sum of shares of our common stock outstanding of  multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of per share on december   or billion  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class e preferred stock of million  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class f preferred stock of million  outstanding borrowings of million on our credit facility  outstanding mortgages payable of million  and outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of billion 
at the close of the acquisition of american realty capital trust  inc  or arct  on january   our total market capitalization increased to over billion 
notes receivable as of december   we had million in notes receivable  which are secured by the properties on which the note receivables were placed 
included in this amount are million of notes receivable acquired in  million of notes receivable acquired in  million of notes receivable held by our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary  crest  and million of notes receivable from a property sale 
mortgage debt as of december   we had million of mortgages payable  which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions in and additionally  at december   we had net premiums totaling million on these mortgages 
during  we paid million in principal payments  which includes million to pay off one mortgage in march in conjunction with our acquisition of arct in january  we assumed approximately million of mortgages payable 
we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so 
we intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness 
billion acquisition credit facility in may  we entered into a new billion unsecured acquisition credit facility  which replaced our million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in march the initial term of the new credit facility expires in may and includes  at our option  a one year extension 
under this new credit facility  our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate  commonly referred to as libor  plus with a facility commitment fee of  for all in drawn pricing of over libor 
the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling 
we also have other interest rate options available to us 
our credit facility is unsecured and  accordingly  we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 
at december   we had a borrowing capacity of million available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of million 
the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility  at december   was per annum 
we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility 
at december   we remain in compliance with these covenants 
we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility  up to million  to a total borrowing capacity of billion 
any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 

table of contents cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities  and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 
acquisitions during during  realty income invested billion in real estate  acquiring properties  and properties under development  with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 
the majority of the lease revenue from these properties is generated from investment grade tenants 
these properties  and properties under development  are located in states  will contain over million leasable square feet  and are leased with an average lease term of years 
the tenants of the properties acquired operate in industries aerospace  apparel stores  automotive collision services  automotive parts  consumer appliances  consumer goods  convenience stores  crafts and novelties  diversified industrial  dollar stores  drug stores  equipment services  food processing  health and fitness  insurance  machinery  motor vehicle dealerships  packaging  paper  restaurants quick service  theaters  transportation services  and wholesale clubs 
none of the investments in these properties caused any one tenant to be or more of our total assets at december  the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a net leased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or  in the case of a property under development  the estimated base rent for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total cost of the properties 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 
of the billion realty income invested in  approximately million was used to originate a note receivable  which is secured by the properties on which the note receivable was placed 
during  crest invested  in one property in the restaurant casual industry 
january acquisition of american realty capital trust  inc on january   we completed our acquisition of arct  in a transaction valued at approximately billion 
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement and plan of merger dated as of september   as amended on january   at the effective time of the acquisition  each outstanding share of arct common stock was converted into the right to receive a combination of i in cash and ii shares of our common stock 
in connection with the acquisition  at the closing we terminated and repaid the amounts then outstanding of approximately million under arct s revolving credit facility and term loan 
in conjunction with our acquisition of arct in january  we assumed approximately million of mortgages payable 
with this acquisition  we added properties to our portfolio 
through  we have incurred million of merger costs 
we anticipate that the total merger costs will be approximately million 
in january  in conjunction with our acquisition of arct  we entered into a million senior unsecured term loan maturing january  borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor  plus 
in conjunction with this term loan  we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 

table of contents portfolio discussion leasing results at december   we had properties available for lease out of  properties in our portfolio  which represents a occupancy rate 
since december   when we reported properties available for lease and a occupancy rate  we leased properties  sold properties available for lease  and have new properties available for lease 
during  properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants 
the rent on these leases was million  as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of million 
at december   our average annualized rental revenue per square foot was approximately per square foot on the  leased properties in our portfolio 
at december   we classified properties with a carrying amount of million as held for sale on our balance sheet 
investments in existing properties in  we capitalized costs of million on existing properties in our portfolio  consisting of million for re leasing costs and million for building and tenant improvements 
in  we capitalized costs of million on existing properties in our portfolio  consisting of million for re leasing costs and million for building improvements 
as part of our re leasing costs  we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions 
leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal 
we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs  hvac improvements  and parking lot resurfacing and replacements 
it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives 
the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly  depending on the rental market  credit worthiness  and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 
impact of real estate and credit markets in the commercial real estate market  property prices generally continue to fluctuate 
likewise  during certain periods  the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which may impact our access to and cost of capital 
we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and  if required  make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 
see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report 
increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders we continue our year policy of paying monthly dividends 
monthly dividends per common share increased by in april to  increased by in july to  increased by in september to  increased by in october to  increased by in january to  and increased by in february to 
the increase in january was our st consecutive quarterly increase and the increase in february was our th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in in  we paid three monthly cash dividends per common share in the amount of  three in the amount of  two in the amount of  one in the amount of  and three in the amount of totaling 
in december  we declared dividends of per share  which were paid in january in january and february  we declared dividends of per share  which will be paid in february and march  respectively 

table of contents the current monthly dividend of per share represents a current annualized dividend of per share  and an annualized dividend yield of approximately based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of on february  although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends  we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends  that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share  or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 
note issuance in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due january  or the notes  and million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due october  or the notes 
the price to the investors for the notes was of the principal amount for an effective yield of per annum 
the price to the investors for the notes was of the principal amount for an effective yield of per annum 
the total net proceeds of approximately million from these offerings were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility  and the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include additional property acquisitions 
universal shelf registration in october  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in october this replaces our prior shelf registration statement 
in accordance with sec rules  the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit 
the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock  warrants to purchase debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or depositary shares  and any combination of these securities 
we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered 
the specifics of any future offerings  along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered  will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement  or other offering materials  at the time of any offering 
environmental insurance policies in july  we entered into new ten year environmental primary and excess insurance policies that expire in july the limits on our new primary policy are million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
the limits on the excess policy are million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
therefore  the primary and excess ten year policies together provide a total limit of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
authorized shares in june  our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock to  and the number of authorized shares of our preferred stock to  incentive award plan in march  our board of directors adopted  and in may  our stockholders approved the realty income corporation incentive award plan  or the plan  to enable us to attract and retain the services of directors  employees and consultants considered essential to our long term success

beginning february   the class f preferred shares are redeemable at our option  for per share 
the initial dividend of per share was paid on march   and covered days 
thereafter  dividends of per share will be paid monthly  in arrears 
we redeemed all of the million shares of our monthly income class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock in march for per share  plus accrued dividends 
we incurred a charge of million  representing the class d preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan in march  we established a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  or the dspp  to provide our common shareholders  as well as new investors  with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions 
the dspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions 
the dspp authorizes up to  common shares to be issued 
during  we issued  shares and raised approximately million under the dspp 
from the inception of the dspp through december   we have issued  shares and raised approximately million 
credit agency ratings the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings 
we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a stable outlook  moody s investors service has assigned a rating of baa with a negative outlook  and standard poor s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a stable outlook to our senior notes 
based on our current ratings  the credit facility interest rate is libor plus with a facility commitment fee of  for all in drawn pricing of over libor 
the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus if our credit facility is lower than bbb baa and ii libor plus if our credit rating is a a or higher 
in addition  our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings  which range from i for a rating lower than bbb baa  and ii for a credit rating of a a or higher 
we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions 
in addition  if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change  our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant 
moreover  a rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our debt securities  preferred stock or common stock

table of contents all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 
all of these notes and bonds contain various covenants  including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than times  and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than of our outstanding unsecured debt 
at december   we remain in compliance with these covenants

in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent  we are primarily responsible 
other consists of million of commitments under construction contracts and  of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 
our credit facility and notes payable obligations are unsecured 
accordingly  we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 
preferred stock outstanding in  we issued million shares of class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock

we are current on our obligations to pay dividends on our class e and class f preferred stock 
no unconsolidated investments we have no unconsolidated investments  nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts 
additionally  we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
as such  our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition 
we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business  as well as other factors  to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap  many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies 
one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties 
depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years 
if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that to years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
when acquiring a property  we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  based in each case on their estimated fair values 
intangible assets and liabilities consist of above market or below market lease value of in place leases  the value of in place leases  and tenant relationships  as applicable 
in addition  any assumed mortgages receivable or payable are recorded at their estimated fair values 
another significant judgment must be made as to if  and when  impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property 
key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates  estimated holding periods  capital expenditures  and property sales capitalization rates 
if a property is held for sale  it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value  less estimated cost to sell 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
our strategy of primarily holding properties  long term  directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable  thus requiring the recognition of an impairment 
however  if our strategy  or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future  an impairment may need to be recognized 
if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment  they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and rental revenue rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of million  or 
rental revenue was million in the increase in rental revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to the properties million square feet acquired by realty income in  which generated million of rent in  the properties million square feet acquired by realty income in  which generated million of rent in compared to million in  an increase of million  same store rents generated on  properties million square feet during the entire years of and  increased by  or  to million from million  a net decrease of million relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties million square feet that were available for lease during part of or  ii rental revenue related to properties sold during and  and iii lease termination settlements which  in aggregate  totaled million in compared to million in  and a net increase in straight line rent and other non cash adjustments to rent of million in as compared to for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool  we include all properties that were owned for the entire year to date period  for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that  i were available for lease at any time  ii were under development  iii we have made an additional investment in  iv were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced  and v were re leased with rent free periods 
each of the exclusions from the same store pool is separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period

percentage rent  which is included in rental revenue  was million in  million in and million in excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of  in   in and  in 
percentage rent in was less than of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than of rental revenue in our portfolio of real estate  leased primarily to regional and national commercial enterprises under net leases  continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders 
at december   our portfolio of  properties was leased with properties available for lease as compared to at december  it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time  however  it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future

ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures 
our ebitda and adjusted ebitda computation may not be comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda reported by other companies that interpret the definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do 
management believes ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be meaningful measures of a reit s performance because they are widely followed by industry analysts  lenders and investors and are used by management as measures of performance 
in addition  management utilizes adjusted ebitda because our billion credit facility uses a similar metric to measure our compliance with certain covenants 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered along with  but not as alternatives to  net income as measures of our operating performance

at december   we classified real estate with a carrying amount of million as held for sale on our balance sheet 
in  we intend to continue implementing more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 
as a result  we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified  from which we anticipate receiving between million and million in proceeds during the next months 
we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions  if there are attractive opportunities available 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next months at our estimated values or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties

additionally  net income available to common stockholders in includes a million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our class d preferred stock  which represents on a diluted per common share basis 
the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess real estate 
the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders

we define normalized ffo  a non gaap measure  as ffo excluding the merger related costs for our acquisition of arct 
we consider ffo and normalized ffo to be appropriate supplemental measures of a reit s operating performance as they are based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo  and adds back merger related costs  for normalized ffo 
the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation of buildings and improvements  which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit  using historical accounting for depreciation  could be less informative 
the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 
in addition  ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility

includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our senior notes were issued in march  november  march  september  september  september  june  june and october additionally  this includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred and capitalized in connection with our assumption of the mortgages payable 
these costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages 
no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
includes straight line rent revenue and the amortization of above and below market leases 
we believe the non gaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies 
in particular  affo provides an additional measure by which to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to the measurement of the particular company s on going operating performance 
therefore  we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric  and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 
presentation of the information regarding ffo  normalized ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo  normalized ffo and affo in the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo  normalized ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance 
ffo  normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating

in addition  ffo  normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions  or of our ability to pay interest payments 
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
of our  properties in our portfolio  approximately or  are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses 
net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements as of december   the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business is not considered to be material 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes and bonds  primarily at fixed rates 
in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps and caps 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks  including counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
the following table presents by year of expected maturity  the principal amounts  average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december  this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions expected maturity data year of maturity fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate debt average interest rate on variable rate debt thereafter totals fair value million of fixed rate senior notes mature in march  million of fixed rate mortgages mature and  of a variable rate mortgage mature in million of fixed rate mortgages and  of a variable rate mortgage mature in million of fixed rate senior notes mature in november  million of fixed rate mortgages and million of variable rate

excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable 
the balance of these net premiums is million at december  we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes at december  on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable 
we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december  on the current year  year or year treasury yield curve  plus an applicable credit adjusted spread 
we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance reasonably approximates its estimated fair value at december  the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates 
all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
all of our mortgages payable  except two  have fixed interest rates 
interest on our credit facility balance is variable 
based on our credit facility balance of million at december   a change in interest rates would change our interest costs by million per year
