table of contents operating activities cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  with the pre christmas inventory increase being the largest 
in the fourth quarter  inventory levels are reduced in connection with christmas sales and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces significant positive cash flow 
operating activities consist primarily of net income  adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
adjustments to net income for non cash items include depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  stock based compensation expense  tax benefits on stock options as well as non cash gains and losses on the disposal of the company assets 
changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily reflect changes in inventories  accounts payable  income taxes payable receivable as well as other working capital changes 
cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal to million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to a million increase in net income  an increase in operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by a million decrease in non cash items 
the increase in operating assets and liabilities year over year is primarily due to the following cash flows provided by changes in inventory and accounts payable decreased million compared to fiscal fiscal accounts payable was lower due to the timing of inventory receipts resulting from the calendar shift caused by the rd week 
changes in accrued expenses for fiscal improved operating cash flows by million compared to fiscal the change was primarily due to higher employee related liabilities and additional retirement plan company matching contributions from the end of fiscal that were subsequently paid in fiscal compared to those balances accrued at the end of fiscal and subsequently paid in fiscal changes in income taxes payable receivable for fiscal improved operating cash flows by million compared to the same period in fiscal income tax payments in were favorably impacted by the timing of implementation of a tax election to deduct certain repair and maintenance costs

table of contents the company expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and results of operations  and require the company most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventory using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market price is generally based on the current selling price of the merchandise 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
historically  the company has rarely experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes  such as customer merchandise preference  unseasonable weather patterns  economic conditions or business trends could cause the company inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends 
the company performs physical inventories at the stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for shrink represents an estimate for shrink for each of the company locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results 
vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances  rebates and cooperative advertising funds received from vendors 
these funds are determined for each fiscal year and the majority are based on various quantitative contract terms 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of merchandise inventories are treated as a reduction of inventory and reduce cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
the company records an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest projected purchase volumes and advertising forecasts 
on an annual basis at the end of the year  the company confirms earned allowances with vendors to ensure the amounts are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill  indefinite lived and other finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred 
our evaluation for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
if these judgments or estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

table of contents when evaluating goodwill for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value 
if so  we proceed to step one of the two step goodwill impairment test  in which we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if not  then performance of the two step goodwill impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow and a market value approach 
the company estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business models  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect the company future financial results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this includes valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit goodwill based upon the residual of the aggregate identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite lives are also not subject to amortization and are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment  or more frequently as mentioned above 
the fair value of the company intangible assets are estimated and compared to their carrying value 
the company estimates the fair value of these intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
this approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future growth and trends  royalty rates in the category of intellectual property  discount rates and other variables 
the company recognizes an impairment charge when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
impairment of long lived assets and closed store reserves the company reviews long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is the store level 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by the company with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
based on an analysis of current and future store performance  management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores 
reserves are established when the company ceases to use the location for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income 
if the timing or amount of actual sublease income differs from estimated amounts  this could result in an increase or decrease in the related reserves 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  industry factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 

table of contents stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield 
in addition  we estimate the number of awards that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures and recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of income 
uncertain tax positions the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company maintains a revolving credit facility to support potential liquidity and capital needs 
our interest rate under the credit agreement is benchmarked to  at the company option  a base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin percentage 
there were no borrowings under the credit agreement or the company prior revolving credit facility in fiscal or the company holds highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase that are classified as cash equivalents 
we had cash equivalent investments at february  and january   totaling million and million  respectively 
since these investments are short term in nature  changes in interest rates generally would not have a material impact on the valuation of these investments 
during fiscal and  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with inflation 

table of contents tax matters presently  the company does not believe that there are any tax matters that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly results the company business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of the company net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the company fiscal year  which is due in part to the holiday selling season and in part to sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in fiscal fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year
