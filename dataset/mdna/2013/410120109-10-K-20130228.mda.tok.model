having completed the integration of whitney and hancock  we will evaluate future acquisition opportunities that have the potential to increase shareholder value 
in market expansion is our first priority 
however  we would also consider strategic opportunities in new markets such as texas locations outside the houston area and northern alabama 
recent acquisitions and continued internal growth have diversified our sources of revenue and enhanced core deposit funding 
hancock s size and scale enables us attract and retain high quality associates 
from a financial perspective  the recent whitney acquisition is expected to be accretive from onward as cost savings are fully phased in

loan production and credit review the banks primary lending focus is to provide commercial  consumer and real estate loans to consumers  to small and middle market businesses  and to corporate clients in their respective markets 
we seek to provide quality loan products that are attractive to the borrower and to the client and profitable to hancock 
we look to build strong  profitable client relationships over time and maintain a strong presence and position of influence in the communities we serve 
through this relationship based approach we have developed a deep knowledge of our customers and the markets in which they operate 
the company continually works to improve the consistency of our lending processes across all of our banking divisions  to strengthen the underwriting criteria we employ to evaluate new loans and loan renewals  and to diversify its loan portfolio in terms of type  industry and geographical concentration 
we believe that these measures will better position hancock to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in the markets it serves while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability  loan growth and loan quality 
the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures of the lending function and presents our principal categories of loans 
the results of our lending activities and the relative risk of the loan portfolio are discussed in part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
during  hancock began the process of integrating the loan policies  underwriting standards and key underwriting functions of whitney to achieve a consistent approach by both banks 
these underwriting standards address collateral requirements  guarantor requirements including policies on financial statement  tax return  and guarantees  requirements regarding appraisals and their review  loan approval hierarchy  standard consumer and small business credit scoring underwriting criteria including credit score thresholds  maximum maturity and amortization  loan to value limits  global debt service coverage  and debt to income limits  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial underwriting guidelines including minimum debt service coverage ratio  maximum amortization  minimum equity requirements  maximum loan to value ratios  lending limits  and credit approval authorities 
additionally  we continue to enhance our loan concentration policy to limit and manage our exposure to certain loan concentrations 
this policy calls for a more detailed process for portfolio risk management and reporting  the imposition of large borrower concentration limits and more systematic monitoring of large commercial loans and increased monitoring of our portfolio mix 
the company currently has no significant concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or to any foreign entities  although it continues to have significant industry concentration in commercial real estate loans that it is working to reduce 
utilizing the regulatory definition for concentrations of total capital and excluding loans acquired during the peoples first transaction those covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic the company had the following industry concentrations as of december   including both funded and unfunded commitments commercial real estate of rbc mining  oil and gas of rbc manufacturing of rbc construction of rbc retail trade of rbc healthcare of rbc wholesale trade of rbc our underwriting process is structured to require oversight that is proportional to the size and complexity of the lending relationship 
we delegate designated relationship managers and credit officers loan authority that can be utilized to approve credit commitments for a single borrowing relationship 
the limit of delegated authority is based upon the experience  skill  and training of the relationship manager or credit officer 
certain types of loans must be approved by either one of the banks centralized underwriting units or the banks executive loan committee 
loans are underwritten in accordance with the credit underwriting standards and loan policies of the banks 
loans are underwritten primarily on the basis of the borrower s ability to make debt service and secondarily on collateral value 
generally  real estate secured loans and mortgage loans are made when the borrower produces evidence of the ability to make debt service along with appropriate equity in the property 
appropriate and regulatory compliant third party valuations are required at the time of origination for real estate secured loans 
we present loan portfolio as originated  acquired and covered loans because these segments use different accounting and allowance methodologies 
originated loans include legacy hancock loans and loans originated from the acquired banks locations since their acquisitions 
acquired loans are those purchased in the whitney acquisition on june  covered loans are those purchased in the december acquisition of peoples first  which are covered by loss share agreements between the fdic and the company that afford significant loss protection 
within these categories  we have commercial  residential mortgage and consumer loans 
commercial the banks offer a variety of commercial loan services to a diversified customer base over a range of industries  including energy  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products  manufacturing of such products  marine transportation and maritime construction  financial and professional services  and agricultural production 
commercial loans are categorized as commercial and industrial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate loans 
commercial and industrial loans  both secured and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including financing of inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisition and development of real estate and improvements  and the purchase of equipment and machinery 
these loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and  if secured  on the underlying collateral 
most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal or corporate guarantee  however  some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
the banks make construction and land development loans to builders and real estate developers for the acquisition  development and construction of business and residential purpose properties 
construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
construction loans are generally based upon cost estimates and the projected value of the complete project 
the banks monitor the construction process to mitigate or identify risks as they arise 
construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the banks until permanent financing is obtained 
these loans are typically closely monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  governmental regulation of real property  general economic conditions and the availability of long term financing 
we have actively reduced our overall residential construction and development lending activities over the course of the last three years 
commercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages on both income producing and owner occupied properties 
we have executed a strategy to increase the proportion of loans secured by owner occupied properties in recent years and reduce the number of speculative real estate projects 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan  as well as that of a real estate loan 
repayment of non owner occupied loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the income producing property securing the loan 
commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy 
the properties securing the banks commercial real estate portfolios are diverse in terms of type and geographic location 
we monitor and evaluate commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography and risk grade criteria 
while some markets within the footprint have shown signs of improvement  commercial real estate lending represents an area of elevated risk and we continue to limit this segment of the portfolio 
residential mortgage a portion of the banks lending activities consists of the origination of both fixed rate and adjustable rate home loans  although we re sell most fixed rate production in the secondary mortgage market on a best efforts basis origination 
the sale of mortgage loans allows the banks to manage the interest rate risks related to such lending operations 
because of the uncertainty of the supply and demand  the general condition of the economy  coupled with unemployment levels  we believe that values of residential real estate have not yet stabilized in many markets 
consumer consumer loans include second mortgage home loans  home equity lines of credit and non residential consumer purpose loans 
non residential consumer loans include direct and indirect loans made to finance automobiles  recreation vehicles  boats purchases  and other personal secured and unsecured and deposit account secured loans 
consumer loans are attractive because they typically have a shorter term  provide granularity of size for the overall portfolio  and produce a higher overall yield 
the banks also have a small portfolio of credit card receivables issued on the basis of applications received through referrals from the banks branches and other marketing efforts 
the banks approve consumer loans based on employment and financial information submitted by prospective borrowers as well as credit reports collected from various credit agencies 
financial stability and credit history of the borrower are the primary factors the banks consider in granting such loans 
the availability of collateral is also a factor considered in making such loans 
the geographic area of the borrower is another consideration  with preference given to borrowers in the banks primary market areas 
a small consumer finance portfolio is maintained by harrison finance company 
while it was expected that this customer base would be much more likely to be severely impacted by employment weakness and loss of access to credit  losses to date have been very manageable 
the portfolio has a higher risk profile than the banks consumer portfolio  but carries a higher yield 
securities portfolio our investment portfolio includes  among other asset classes  us agency debt securities  us agency mortgage related securities and obligations of states and municipalities classified as available for sale and held to maturity 
as such  the company considers the available for sale portfolio as one of many sources of liquidity used to fund our operations 
investments are made in accordance with the investment policy and also tested under multiple stressed interest rate scenarios  the results of which are used to manage our interest rate risk position 
the rate scenarios include regulatory and management agreed upon instantaneous and ramped rate movements that may be up to plus and minus basis points 
the combined portfolio has a target effective duration of two to five years 
we also utilize a significant portion of the securities portfolio to secure certain deposits and other liabilities requiring collateralization 
to retain a source of liquidity  we limit the percentage of securities that can be pledged in order to keep a portion of securities available for sale 
the securities portfolio can also be pledged to increase our line of credit availability at the federal home loan bank of dallas although we have not had to do so 
the investments subcommittee of the asset liability committee alco is responsible for evaluating issues related to the management of the investment portfolio 
the investments subcommittee is also responsible for the development of investment strategies for the consideration and approval of the alco 
final authority and responsibility for all aspects of the conduct of investment activities rests with the board risk committee  all in accordance with the overall guidance and limitations of the investment policy 
deposits the banks have several programs designed to attract depository accounts offered to consumers and to small and middle market businesses at interest rates generally consistent with market conditions 
deposits provide the most significant funding source for the company s interest earning assets 
deposits are attracted principally from clients within our retail branch network through the offering of a broad array of deposit products to individuals and businesses  including non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  interest bearing transaction accounts  savings accounts  money market deposit accounts  and time deposit accounts 
terms vary among deposit products with respect to commitment periods  minimum balances  and applicable fees 
interest paid on deposits represents the largest component of our interest expense 
interest rates offered on interest bearing deposits are determined based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  interest rates offered in local markets by competitors  current and expected economic conditions  anticipated future interest rates  the expected amount and timing of funding needs  and the availability and cost of alternative funding sources 
deposit flows are controlled by the banks primarily through pricing  and to a certain extent  through promotional activities 
management believes that the rates it offers  which are posted weekly on deposit accounts  are generally competitive with other financial institutions in the banks respective market areas 
client deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost 
deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship and provide opportunities to cross sell other company services 
the banks also hold public funds as deposits 
the banks appetite for public funds  as with any type of deposit  is determined by alco s funding and liquidity sub committee while pricing decisions are determined by alco s deposit pricing sub committee 
typically many public fund deposits are allocated based upon the rate of interest offered and the ability of the bank to provide collateralization 
the banks can influence the level of its public fund deposits through pricing decisions 
public deposits typically require the pledging of collateral  most commonly marketable securities 
this is taken into account when determining the level of interest to be paid on public deposits 
the pledging of collateral  monitoring and management reporting represents additional operational requirements for the banks 
these deposits are more volatile because they tend to be high balance deposits 
public funds have not historically presented any special risks to the banks 
public funds are only one of many possible sources of liquidity that the banks have available to draw upon as part of its liquidity funding strategy as defined by alco 
the banks may accept and did accept in brokered deposits as part of their funding 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits 
the company issued brokered deposits through the use of third party intermediaries 
while we did not expect to see deposits leave in conjunction with the expiration of the tag program  these cds were issued as a temporary liquidity source in the event we saw any such activity 
however  our banks did not experience any material outflow of deposits as a result of the tag expiration 
trust services the banks  through their respective trust departments  offer a full range of trust services on a fee basis 
in their trust capacities  the banks provide investment management services on an agency basis and act as trustee for pension plans  profit sharing plans  corporate and municipal bond issues  living trusts  life insurance trusts and various other types of trusts created by or for individuals  businesses  charitable and religious organizations 
as of december   the trust departments of the banks had approximately billion of assets under administration compared to billion as of december  as of december   billion of administered assets were corporate trust accounts and the remaining balances were personal  employee benefit  estate and other trust accounts 
competition the deregulation of the financial services industry  the elimination of many previous distinctions between commercial banks and other financial institutions as well as legislation enacted in mississippi  louisiana and other states allowing state wide branching  multi bank holding companies and regional interstate banking have all served to foster a highly competitive environment for commercial banking in our market area 
the principal competitive factors in the markets for deposits and loans are interest rates and fee structures associated with the various products offered 
we also compete through the efficiency  quality  and range of services and products we provide  as well as the convenience provided by an extensive network of customer access channels including local branch offices  atms  online banking  and telebanking centers 
in attracting deposits and in our lending activities  we generally compete with other commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  mutual funds and insurance companies  and other financial institutions

supervision and regulation bank holding company regulation general the company is subject to extensive regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve pursuant to the bank holding company act of  as amended the bank holding company act 
on january  the company qualified as a financial holding company  giving it broader powers as discussed below 
the company also is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise complies with the rules and regulations of  the securities and exchange commission the commission under federal securities laws 
federal regulation the bank holding company act generally prohibits a corporation that owns a bank from engaging in activities other than banking  managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries 
acquiring or obtaining control of more than of the voting shares of any company that engages in activities other than those activities determined by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking  managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto is also prohibited 
in determining whether a particular activity is permissible  the federal reserve considers whether the performance of the activity can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects 
for example making  acquiring or servicing loans  leasing personal property  providing certain investment or financial advice  performing certain data processing services  acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance  and performing certain insurance underwriting activities have all been determined by the federal reserve to be permissible activities 
the bank holding company act does not place territorial limits on permissible bank related activities of bank holding companies 
even with respect to permissible activities  however  the federal reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or its control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or control of such subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
the bank holding company act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before it acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if  after such acquisition  such bank holding company will own or control more than of the voting shares of such bank  before it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank acquires all of the assets of a bank  before it merges with any other bank holding company  or before it engages in permissible non banking activities 
in reviewing a proposed covered acquisition  the federal reserve considers its financial  managerial and competitive aspects 
the future prospects of the companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served are also considered 
the federal reserve also reviews the indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with the proposed acquisition to ensure that the holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability to meet the regulatory capital requirements imposed on the holding company or its subsidiaries 
the bank holding company act further requires that consummation of approved bank holding company or bank acquisitions or mergers must be delayed for a period of not less than or more than days following the date of approval 
during such to day period  complaining parties may obtain a review of the federal reserve s order granting its approval by filing a petition in the appropriate united states court of appeals petitioning that the order be set aside 
the gramm leach bliley act of the financial services modernization act repealed the two affiliation provisions of the glass steagall act section  which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and section  which restricted officer  director  or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
the financial services modernization act also preempted any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
generally  the act establishes a comprehensive framework that permits affiliations among qualified bank holding companies  commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms  and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bank holding company act framework to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
the financial services modernization act requires that each bank subsidiary of a financial holding company be well capitalized and well managed as determined by the subsidiary bank s principal regulator 
to be considered well managed  the bank must have received at least a satisfactory composite rating and a satisfactory management rating at its most recent examination 
to be well capitalized  the bank must have a leverage capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
these ratios are discussed further below 
a financial holding company that becomes aware that a subsidiary bank has ceased to be well capitalized or well managed must notify the federal reserve and enter into an agreement to cure such condition 
the consequences of a failure to cure such condition are that the federal reserve board may order the financial holding company to divest the bank 
alternatively  a financial holding company may cease to engage in the financial holding company activities that are unrelated to banking or otherwise impermissible for a bank holding company 
the federal reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for use in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and financial holding companies 
the regulatory capital of a bank holding company or financial holding company under applicable federal capital adequacy guidelines is particularly important in the federal reserve s evaluation of a holding company and any applications made by the bank holding company to the federal reserve 
if regulatory capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a financial holding company may lose its status as a financial holding company and a bank holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses or to open additional facilities 
there are two measures of regulatory capital presently applicable to bank holding companies risk based capital and leverage capital ratios 
the federal reserve rates bank holding companies through a confidential component and composite rating system  with a composite rating of being the highest rating and being the lowest 
this system is designed to help identify institutions requiring special attention 
financial institutions are assigned ratings based on evaluation and rating of their financial condition and operations 
components reviewed include capital adequacy  asset quality  management capability  the quality and level of earnings  the adequacy of liquidity and sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations 
the leverage ratios adopted by the federal reserve require all but the most highly rated bank holding companies to maintain tier capital at of total assets 
certain bank holding companies having a composite rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth may satisfy the federal reserve guidelines by maintaining tier capital of at least of total assets reduced by deductions from tier capital discussed below 
tier capital for bank holding companies generally includes common equity  retained earnings  non controlling interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock 
in calculating tier capital  goodwill and other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets and certain other assets are excluded 
the company s tier capital leverage ratio at december  was 
the risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under the risk based capital guidelines  assets are assigned to one of four risk categories  and 
as an example  us treasury securities are assigned to the risk category while most categories of loans are assigned to the risk category 
a two step process determines the risk weight of off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit 
first  the amount of the off balance sheet item is multiplied by a credit conversion factor of either   or 
the result is then assigned to one of the four risk categories 
the primary component of risk based capital is tier capital  which was described above 
tier capital  which consists primarily of perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  mandatory convertible securities  certain types of subordinated debt and a limited amount of the allowances for loan losses  is a secondary component of risk based capital 
the risk weighted asset base is equal to the sum of the aggregate dollar values of assets and off balance sheet items in each risk category  multiplied by the weight assigned to that category 
a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of total capital tier and tier to risk weighted assets of at least must be maintained by bank holding companies 
at december   the company s tier and total capital risk based ratios were and  respectively 
as described above  the prior approval of the federal reserve must be obtained before the company may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if  after such acquisition  it would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting shares of such bank 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of riegle neal act permits adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies to acquire control of banks in any state  subject to federal regulatory approval  without regard to whether such a transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state 
federal banking regulators may approve merger transactions involving banks located in different states  without regard to laws of any state prohibiting such transactions  except that mergers may not be approved with respect to banks located in states that  before june   opted out of the riegle neal act by enacting legislation prohibiting mergers by banks located in such state with out of state institutions 
mississippi opted into the interstate branching provision of the riegle neal act 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be so permitted 
previously  banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
accordingly  banks will be able to enter new markets more freely 
the riegle neal act further provides that a bank holding company may not  following an interstate acquisition  control more than of nationwide insured deposits or of deposits in any state where the acquiring bank operates 
states have the right to adopt legislation to lower the limit 
additional provisions require that interstate activities conform to the community reinvestment act 
the company is required to give the federal reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding months  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve may disapprove such a transaction if it determines that the proposal constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice  would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve order or directive or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve 
in november  the federal reserve adopted its policy statement on cash dividends not fully covered by earnings the policy statement 
the policy statement sets forth various guidelines that the federal reserve believes that a bank holding company should follow in establishing its dividend policy 
in general  the federal reserve stated that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings 
it also stated that dividends should not be paid unless the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with its capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the banks 
there are various restrictions that limit the ability of the banks to finance  pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the company or other affiliates 
in addition  subsidiary banks of holding companies are subject to certain restrictions on any extension of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries  on investments in the stock or other securities thereof and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower 
further  a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit  or leases or sales of property or furnishing of services 
bank regulation the operations of the banks are subject to state and federal statutes applicable to state banks and the regulations of the federal reserve and the fdic 
the operation of the banks may also be subject to applicable occ regulation  to the extent state banks are granted parity with national banks 
such statutes and regulations relate to  among other things  required reserves  investments  loans  mergers and consolidations  issuance of securities  payment of dividends  establishment of branches and other aspects of the banks operations 
hancock bank is subject to regulation and periodic examinations by the fdic and the state of mississippi department of banking and consumer finance 
whitney bank is subject to regulation and periodic examinations by the fdic and the office of financial institutions  state of louisiana 
these regulatory authorities examine such areas as reserves  loan and investment quality  management policies  procedures and practices and other aspects of operations 
these examinations are designed to protect the banks depositors  rather than their stockholders 
in addition to these regular examinations  the company and the banks must furnish periodic reports to their respective regulatory authorities containing a full and accurate statement of their affairs 
the company is required to file annual reports with the federal reserve board  and such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bank holding company act 
the federal reserve board may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries  and charge the company for the cost of such examination 
the dodd frank act has removed many limitations on the federal reserve board s authority to make examinations of banks that are subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
under the dodd frank act  the federal reserve board is generally permitted to examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries  provided that the federal reserve board must rely on reports submitted directly by the institution and examination reports of the appropriate regulators such as the fdic and the banking department to the fullest extent possible  must provide reasonable notice to  and consult with  the appropriate regulators before commencing an examination of a bank holding company subsidiary  and  to the fullest extent possible  must avoid duplication of examination activities  reporting requirements  and requests for information 
as a result of the enactment of the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea  a financial institution insured by the fdic can be held liable for any losses incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured financial institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled financial institution in danger of default 
thus  hancock bank and whitney bank have potential exposure for any losses incurred by the fdic with respect to the activities of each other 
the banks are members of the fdic  and their deposits are insured as provided by law by the deposit insurance fund  or the dif 
the deposits of the banks are insured up to applicable limits and the banks are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif 
the fdic utilizes a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
effective january   the fdic began imposing deposit assessment rates based on the risk category of the bank  with risk category i being the lowest risk category and risk category iv being the highest risk category 
the dodd frank act changed the method of calculation for fdic insurance assessments 
under the previous system  the assessment base was domestic deposits minus a few allowable exclusions  such as pass through reserve balances 
under the dodd frank act  assessments are calculated based on the depository institution s average consolidated total assets  less its average amount of tangible equity 
in addition to providing for the required change in assessment base  the fdic s final deposit insurance regulations implementing the dodd frank provisions eliminated the assessment adjustments based on unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits  added a new adjustment for holding unsecured debt issued by another insured depository institution  and lowered the initial base assessment rate schedule in order to collect approximately the same amount of revenue under the new base as under the old base  among other changes 
beginning april   the base assessment rates ranged from to basis points  with the initial assessment rates subject to adjustments which could increase or decrease the total base assessment rates 
the adjustments included a decrease for long term unsecured debt  including most senior and subordinated debt and  for small institutions  a portion of tier capital  and for non risk category i institutions  an increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount 
the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from  to  per depositor 
however  with the passage of the dodd frank act  this increase in the basic coverage limit has been made permanent 
since the first quarter of  all institutions with deposits insured by the fdic have been required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  a mixed ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the deposit insurance fund 
the fico assessment rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fund based on quarterly call report and thrift financial report submissions 
the current annualized assessment rate is basis points  or approximately basis points per quarter 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in through the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia subjects banks and bank holding companies to increased regulation and supervision  including a new regulatory emphasis linking supervision to bank capital levels 
also  federal banking regulators are required to take prompt regulatory action with respect to depository institutions that fall below specified capital levels and to draft non capital regulatory measures to assure bank safety 
fdicia contains a prompt corrective action section intended to address problem institutions at the least possible long term cost to the deposit insurance funds 
pursuant to this section  the federal banking agencies are required to prescribe a leverage limit and a risk based capital requirement indicating levels at which institutions will be deemed to be well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
in the case of a depository institution that is critically undercapitalized a term defined to include institutions which still have positive net worth  the federal banking regulators are generally required to appoint a conservator or receiver 
fdicia further requires regulators to perform annual on site bank examinations  places limits on real estate lending and tightens audit requirements 
the legislation eliminated the too big to fail doctrine  which protects uninsured deposits of large banks  and restricts the ability of undercapitalized banks to obtain extended loans from the federal reserve board discount window 
fdicia also imposes new disclosure requirements relating to fees charged and interest paid on checking and deposit accounts 
in addition to regulating capital  the fdic has broad authority to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices 
pursuant to this authority  the fdic has adopted regulations that restrict preferential loans and loan amounts to affiliates and insiders of banks  require banks to keep information on loans to major stockholders and executive officers and bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions 
the fdic is also authorized to approve mergers  consolidations and assumption of deposit liability transactions between insured banks and between insured banks and uninsured banks or institutions to prevent capital or surplus diminution in such transactions where the resulting  continuing or assumed bank is an insured nonmember state bank  like hancock bank and whitney bank 
although hancock bank and whitney bank are not members of the federal reserve system  they are subject to federal reserve regulations that require the banks to maintain reserves against transaction accounts primarily checking accounts 
the federal reserve regulations currently require that reserves be maintained against net transaction accounts in the amount of of the aggregate of such accounts up to million  or  if the aggregate of such accounts exceeds million  of the total in excess of million 
this regulation is subject to an exemption from reserve requirements on million of an institution s transaction accounts 
the financial services modernization act also permits national banks  and through state parity statutes  state banks  to engage in expanded activities through the formation of financial subsidiaries 
a state bank may have a subsidiary engaged in any activity authorized for state banks directly or any financial activity  except for insurance underwriting  insurance investments  real estate investment or development  or merchant banking  each of which activity may only be conducted through a subsidiary of a financial holding company 
financial activities include all activities permitted under new sections of the bank holding company act or permitted by regulation 
a state bank seeking to have a financial subsidiary  and each of its depository institution affiliates  must be well capitalized and well managed 
the total assets of all financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of of a bank s total assets  or billion 
a state bank must exclude from its assets and equity all equity investments  including retained earnings  in a financial subsidiary 
the assets of the subsidiary may not be consolidated with the bank s assets 
the bank must also have policies and procedures to assess financial subsidiary risk and protect the bank from such risks and potential liabilities 
the financial services modernization act also includes a new section of the federal deposit insurance act governing subsidiaries of state banks that engage in activities as principal that would only be permissible for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary 
it expressly preserves the ability of a state bank to retain all existing subsidiaries 
because mississippi and louisiana permit commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks  the banks will be permitted to form subsidiaries to engage in the activities authorized by the financial services modernization act 
in order to form a financial subsidiary  a state bank must be well capitalized  and the state bank would be subject to the same capital deduction  risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks 
in  the usa patriot act was signed into law 
the usa patriot act broadened the application of anti money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions  such as broker dealers  and strengthened the ability of the us government to detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions  including state member banks i establish an anti money laundering program that includes training and audit components  ii comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account  iii take additional required precautions with non us owned accounts  and iv perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships 
the usa patriot act also expanded the conditions under which funds in a us interbank account may be subject to forfeiture and increased the penalties for violation of anti money laundering regulations 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
the banks have adopted policies  procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the usa patriot act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies  procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations 
in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted 
eesa authorized the treasury department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program tarp 
on november   following a thorough evaluation and analysis  the company announced it would not participate in the cpp 
whitney participated in the tarp program  but the preferred stock issued to treasury was subsequently purchased and retired by hancock in conjunction with the acquisition 
recent developments the congress  treasury department and the federal banking regulators  including the fdic  have taken broad action since early september  to address volatility in the us banking system  including the passage of eesa discussed above  the provision of other direct and indirect assistance to financial institutions  assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  implementation of programs by the federal reserve board to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and expansion of deposit insurance coverage 
the federal government has pursued additional initiatives in an effort to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets  including the enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and have altered the terms of some previously announced policies 
the enactment of the dodd frank act will likely result in increased regulation of the financial services industry 
provisions likely to affect the activities of the company and the banks include  without limitation  the following asset based deposit insurance assessments 
fdic deposit insurance premium assessments are based on bank assets rather than domestic deposits 
deposit insurance limit increase 
the deposit insurance coverage limit has been permanently increased from  to  establishment of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb 
the cfpb is housed within the federal reserve and  in consultation with the federal banking agencies  makes rules relating to consumer protection 
the cfpb has the authority  should it wish to do so  to rewrite virtually all of the consumer protection regulations governing banks  including those implementing the truth in lending act  the real estate settlement procedures act or respa  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the equal credit opportunity act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the safe mortgage licensing act  the fair credit reporting act except sections e and  the fair debt collection practices act  and the gramm leach bliley act sections through relating to privacy  among others 
on january  president obama named the first director of the cfpb by way of recess appointment 
hancock is subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in respect of the foregoing consumer protection acts and regulations 
risk retention rule 
under current proposed rules  banks originating loans for sale on the secondary market or securitization would be required to retain of any loan they sell or securitize  except for mortgages that meet low risk standards to be developed by regulators 
limitation on federal preemption 
limitations have been imposed on the ability of national bank regulators to preempt state law 
formerly  the national bank and federal thrift regulators possessed preemption powers with regard to transactions  operating subsidiaries and attorney general civil enforcement authority 
these preemption requirements have been limited by the dodd frank act  which will likely impact state banks by affecting activities previously permitted through parity with national banks 
changes to regulation of bank holding companies 
under the dodd frank act  bank holding companies must be well capitalized and well managed to engage in interstate transactions 
in the past  only the subsidiary banks were required to meet those standards 
the federal reserve board s source of strength doctrine has now been codified  mandating that bank holding companies such as the company serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks  such that the bank holding company must be able to provide financial assistance in the event the subsidiary bank experiences financial distress 
executive compensation limitations 
the dodd frank act codified executive compensation limitations similar to those previously imposed on tarp recipients 
the dodd frank act contains different titles  is over pages long  and calls for the completion of dozens of studies and reports and hundreds of new regulations 
the information provided herein regarding the effect of the dodd frank act is intended merely for illustration and is not exhaustive  as the full impact of the legislation on banks and bank holding companies is still being studied and in any event cannot be fully known until the completion of new federal agency rulemakings over the next few years 
interested shareholders should refer directly to the dodd frank act itself for additional information 
the dodd frank act is one of a number of legislative initiatives that have been proposed in recent years due to the national and global financial crisis 
it is not possible to predict whether any other additional legislation may be adopted that would significantly affect the operations and performance of the company and the banks 
in the summer of  our primary federal regulators the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation published two notices of proposed rulemaking that would substantially revise the risk based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions  compared to the current us risk based capital rules  which are based on the international capital accords of the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee 
one of the capital proposals basel iii proposal addresses the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios  and would implement the basel committee s december framework  known as basel iii  for strengthening international capital standards 
the other proposal standardized approach proposal addresses risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios  and would replace the existing basel i derived risk weighting approach with a more risk sensitive approach based  in part  on the standardized approach in the basel committee s basel ii capital accords 
although the basel iii proposal was proposed to come into effect on january   the federal banking agencies jointly announced on november  that the implementation date would be deferred without establishing a new effective date 
as proposed  the standardized approach proposal will become effective on january  the federal banking agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the final liquidity framework of basel iii  and have not yet determined to what extent they will apply to us banks that are not large  internationally active banks 
regulation e as amended in late  regulation e prohibits banks from charging an overdraft fee for non recurring debit card transactions specifically  point of sale and atm transactions that overdraw a consumer s account unless the consumer affirmatively consents  or opts in  to the bank s payment of overdrafts for those transactions 
the banks do not pay such transactions unless the consumer affirmatively elects  or opts in  to have the banks do so 
debit interchange fees effective june   the federal reserve issued a final rule implementing the durbin amendment to the dodd frank act 
the rule included standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions 
interchange fees  or swipe fees  are fees that merchants pay to credit card companies and card issuing banks like us for processing electronic payment transactions on their behalf 
under the final rule  the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of cents per transaction and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction 
the rule further allows for an upward adjustment of cent to the interchange fee if an issuer certifies that it has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud prevention standards set forth by the federal reserve 
in addition  the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks  and allows merchants to determine transaction routing 
the limits that the dodd frank act and federal reserve rules place on debit interchange fees have reduced our debit card interchange revenues 
the rule became effective october  summary the foregoing is a brief summary of certain statutes  rules and regulations affecting the company and the banks 
it is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all the statutes and regulations having an impact on the operations of such entities 
it is not known whether the above acts and regulations will have any material effect on the company s operations 
however  increased regulation will generally result in increased legal and compliance expense 
finally  additional bills may be introduced in the future in the united states congress and state legislatures to alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions 
it cannot be predicted whether and what form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the company and the banks may be affected thereby 
effect of governmental monetary and fiscal policies the difference between the interest rate paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans and securities comprise most of a bank s earnings 
in order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in the industry  the banking business is becoming increasingly dependent on the generation of fee and service charge revenue 
the earnings and growth of a bank will be affected by both general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policy of the united states government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve sets national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession 
this is accomplished by its open market operations in united states government securities  adjustments in the amount of reserves that financial institutions are required to maintain and adjustments to the discount rates on borrowings and target rates for federal funds transactions 
the actions of the federal reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates on loans and deposits 
the nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their potential impact on the company cannot be predicted 
item a 
risk factors we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below 
while we describe each risk separately  some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 
also  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently do not consider significant  could also potentially impair  and have a material adverse effect on  our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be vulnerable to certain sectors of the economy 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
in a weak economy  or in areas where real estate market conditions are distressed  we may experience a higher than normal level of nonperforming real estate loans  the collateral value of the portfolio and the revenue stream from those loans could come under stress  and additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses could be necessitated 
our ability to dispose of foreclosed real estate at prices above the respective carrying values could also be impaired  causing additional losses 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected the industry in which we operate 
the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and disruption 
continuing distressed conditions in the housing market  with depressed home prices and increased foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institution industry 
in particular  we face the following risks related to these conditions there is increased regulation of our industry  including as a result of the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa and the dodd frank act 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates  which  among other effects  could affect our charge offs and provision for loan losses 
competition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
the current market disruptions make valuation even more difficult and subjective  and our ability to measure the fair value of our assets could be adversely affected 
if we determine that a significant portion of our assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value  we could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made  our capital ratios would be adversely affected and a rating agency might downgrade our credit rating or put us on credit watch 
the financial soundness and stability of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and financial soundness and stability of other financial institutions as a result of credit  trading  clearing or other relationships between such institutions 
we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  and even rumors regarding  other financial institutions  or the financial services industry generally  could impair our ability to effect such transactions and could lead to losses or defaults by us 
in addition  many of our transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client 
additionally  our credit risk may be increased if the collateral we hold in connection with such transactions cannot be realized or can only be liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our financial exposure 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to a risk of rapid and significant changes in market interest rates 
our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as a result  we are subject to significant risks tied to changes in interest rates 
our ability to operate profitably is largely dependent upon net interest income 
unexpected movement in interest rates markedly changing the slope of the current yield curve could cause our net interest margins to decrease  subsequently reducing net interest income 
in addition  such changes could adversely affect the valuation of our assets and liabilities 
certain changes in interest rates  inflation  deflation  or the financial markets could affect demand for our products and our ability to deliver products efficiently 
loan originations  and potentially loan revenues  could be adversely impacted by sharply rising interest rates 
conversely  sharply falling rates could increase prepayments within our securities portfolio lowering interest earnings from those investments 
an underperforming stock market could reduce brokerage transactions  therefore reducing investment brokerage revenues  in addition  wealth management fees associated with managed securities portfolios could also be adversely affected 
an unanticipated increase in inflation could cause our operating costs related to salaries and benefits  technology  and supplies to increase at a faster pace than revenues 
the fair market value of our securities portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
changes in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect our profitability 
our financial performance is affected by credit policies of monetary authorities  particularly the federal reserve board 
the instruments of monetary policy employed by the federal reserve board include open market transactions in us government securities  changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets  we cannot predict the potential impact of future changes in interest rates  deposit levels  and loan demand on our business and earnings 
furthermore  the actions of the united states government and other governments may result in currency fluctuations  exchange controls  market disruption and other adverse effects 
a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure  or those of third parties  could impair our liquidity  disrupt our businesses  result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  damage our reputation and cause financial losses 
our ability to adequately conduct and grow our business is dependent on our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational control infrastructure 
operational risk can arise in numerous ways including employee fraud  customer fraud  and control lapses in bank operations and information technology 
our dependence on our employees and automated systems  including the automated systems used by acquired entities and third parties  to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical failures or tampering of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect 
we are also subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control 
failure to maintain an appropriate operational infrastructure can lead to loss of service to customers  legal actions  and noncompliance with various laws and regulations 
we continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so 
in some instances  we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves 
we also outsource some of these functions to third parties 
these third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control 
we also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and or new third party providers of such platforms into its existing businesses 
an interruption or breach in our information systems or infrastructure  or those of third parties  could disrupt our business  result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  damage our reputation and cause financial losses 
our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions on a daily basis and to securely process  store and transmit confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks 
we rely heavily on our information and communications systems and those of third parties who provide critical components of our information and communications infrastructure 
these systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day operations 
our financial  accounting  data processing or other information systems and facilities  or those of third parties on whom we rely  may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  such as a spike in transaction volume  cyber attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events  which may adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services 
although we make continuous efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have not experienced a cyber attack  threats to information systems continue to evolve and there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will continue to be effective 
the risk of a security breach or disruption  particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion  has increased as the number  intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased 
threats to our information systems may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments  organized crime and other hackers  outsource or infrastructure support providers and application developers  or may originate internally 
as a financial institution  we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from attempts to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers data and financial information  whether through cyber attack  cyber intrusion over the internet  malware  computer viruses  attachments to e mails  spoofing  phishing  or spyware 
as a result  our information  communications and related systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches or other significant disruptions that could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems  which could disrupt our operations and those of certain of our customers  result in the unauthorized access to  and destruction  loss  theft  misappropriation or release of confidential  sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers  including account numbers and other financial information  result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws  subjecting the bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose the bank to civil litigation and possible financial liability  require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result  and harm our reputation or impair our customer relationships 
the occurrence of such failures  disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
to date we have not experienced an attack that has impacted the results of our operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
natural disasters could affect our ability to operate 
our market areas are susceptible to hurricanes 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  can disrupt our operations  result in significant damage to properties and interrupt our ability to conduct business  and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate 
we cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by future hurricanes will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas  but such weather events could cause a decline in loan originations  a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing the loans and an increase in the risk of delinquencies  foreclosures or loan losses 
greater loan losses than expected may adversely affect our earnings 
we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the creditworthiness of our corporate borrowers and the value of the real estate pledged as security for the repayment of loans 
our credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within our local markets 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors 
if our assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses 
we may have to increase our allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators  to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions  or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio 
future provisions for loan losses may vary materially from the amounts of past provisions 
the projected benefit obligations of our pension plan exceed the fair value of the plan s assets 
investments in the portfolio of our pension plan may not provide adequate returns to fully fund benefits as they come due  thus causing higher annual plan expenses and requiring additional contributions by us 
we may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital 
our stock is listed and traded on the nasdaq global select 
if our capital resources prove in the future to be inadequate to meet our capital requirements  we may need to raise additional equity 
if the market should fail to operate  or if conditions in the capital markets are adverse  we may be constrained in raising capital 
we maintain a consistent analyst following  therefore  downgrades in our prospects by an analyst s may cause our stock price to fall and significantly limit our ability to access the markets for additional capital requirements 
sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets  or the perception of such sales  could depress the market price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets and the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  future issuances of equity securities  including pursuant to outstanding options  could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  including you  and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we may issue such additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital 
the issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock 
moreover  to the extent that we issue restricted stock units  phantom shares  stock appreciation rights  options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights  options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest  our shareholders may experience further dilution 
holders of our shares of common stock do not have preemptive rights  therefore  future stock offerings could dilute our shareholders 
we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock would have on the market price of our common stock 
our future growth and financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to successfully execute our growth plans 
we may not be able to continue our organic  or internal  growth  which depends upon economic conditions  our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion  our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  our ability to fund growth at a reasonable cost  sufficient capital to support our growth initiatives  competitive factors  banking laws  and other factors 
we may seek to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions 
we cannot predict the number  size or timing of acquisitions  or whether any such acquisition will occur at all 
our acquisition efforts have traditionally focused on targeted banking or insurance entities in markets in which we currently operate and markets in which we believe we can compete effectively 
however  as consolidation of the financial services industry continues  the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase 
we may compete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities  and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay 
we also may need additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund acquisitions 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or  if available  it may not be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to sell on terms acceptable to us  or we are otherwise unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing necessary for us to continue making acquisitions  we would be required to find other methods to grow our business and we may not grow at the same rate we have in the past  or at all 
we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a bank or bank holding company 
in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition  federal bank regulators will consider  among other factors  the effect of the acquisition on the competition  financial condition  and future prospects 
the regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels  the competence  experience  and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institution s record of compliance under the community reinvestment act and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities 
we cannot be certain when or if  or on what terms and conditions  any required regulatory approvals will be granted 
we may also be required to sell banks or branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval  which condition may not be acceptable to us or  if acceptable to us  may reduce the benefit of any acquisition 
in addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions  as opportunities arise we plan to continue de novo branching as a part of our internal growth strategy and possibly entry into new markets through de novo branching 
de novo branching and any acquisition carries with it numerous risks  including the following the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals  significant costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank  the inability to secure the services of qualified senior management  the local market may not accept the services of a new bank owned and managed by a bank holding company headquartered outside of the market area of the new bank  economic downturns in the new market  the inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost  and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls 
we have experienced to some extent many of these risks with our de novo branching to date 
our inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring businesses and assets could adversely affect our operations 
acquisitions of businesses in the financial services industry are an important element of our business strategy 
we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire businesses in execution of this strategy on terms acceptable to us in the future 
we must also generally satisfy several conditions before we complete an acquisition of another bank or bank holding company  including federal and or state regulatory approvals 
we may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
such additional debt service requirements may impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully consolidate any business or assets we acquire with our existing business 
the integration of acquired operations and assets may require substantial management effort  time and resources and may divert management s focus from other strategic opportunities and operational matters 
acquisitions may not perform as expected when the transaction was consummated and may be dilutive to our overall operating results 
we are subject to regulation by various federal and state entities 
we are subject to the regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec  the federal reserve board  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the mississippi department of banking and consumer finance  and the louisiana office of financial institutions 
new regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities 
we are subject to various federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations 
noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact our business plans  including ability to branch  offer certain products  or execute existing or planned business strategies 
for example  the dodd frank act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in the full impact of the dodd frank act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted 
the dodd frank act may have a material impact on our operations  particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations 
additionally  on august   the federal banking regulatory agencies issued proposed rules that would implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
if adopted as proposed  basel iii and regulations proposed by the federal banking regulatory agencies will require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with the new and higher capital standards 
compliance with these rules  if and when they become effective  will impose additional costs on banking entities and their holding companies 
for additional information regarding the dodd frank act and basel iii  see supervision and regulation 
we are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the sec and the financial accounting standards board 
changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the reported financial statements or our results of operations and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement 
any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time  and we cannot be assured that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us 
changes in accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are fundamental to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements by affecting the value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations 
some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because materially different amounts may be reported if different estimates or assumptions were used 
if such estimates or assumptions underlying the financial statements are incorrect  we could experience material losses 
from time to time  fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of such standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements 
these changes are beyond our control  can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  it is possible  if unlikely  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively  resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements in material amounts 
we are subject to industry competition which may have an impact upon our success 
our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully 
we operate in a highly competitive financial services environment 
certain competitors are larger and may have more resources than we do 
we face competition in our regional market areas from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  internet banks  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services 
some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us or the bank and may have greater flexibility in competing for business 
another competitive factor is that the financial services market  including banking services  is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
our future success may depend  in part  on our ability to use technology competitively to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in our operations 
we and other financial institutions have been the subject of increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation 
we and certain of our directors and officers may be named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to our business and activities 
past  present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
we are also involved from time to time in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding our business 
these matters also could result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions or other relief 
like other financial institutions and companies  we are also subject to risk from employee misconduct  including non compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations and or cause significant reputational harm to our business 
we may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation  which could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets  or by issuing additional debt or equity securities  which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper  medium term notes  senior notes  subordinated notes  preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities 
in the event of our liquidation  our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings 
further  market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future 
our ability to deliver and pay dividends depends primarily upon the results of operations of our subsidiaries 
we are a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our subsidiary banks 
as a result  our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock will depend primarily upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries 
the ability of the banks to pay dividends or make other payments to us is limited by their obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general regulatory restrictions on their dividends 
if these requirements are not satisfied  we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock 
cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily  if not entirely  from dividends paid to us from the banks 
the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is limited by regulatory and legal restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital 
we may also decide to limit the payment of dividends even when we have the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in our business 
there can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends in the future 
we and or the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies 
our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile 
this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us  certain of our affiliates and particular classes of securities that we and our affiliates issue 
the interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by  among other things  the credit ratings that we  our affiliates and or our securities receive from recognized rating agencies 
a downgrade to us  our affiliates or our securities could create obligations or liabilities to us under the terms of our outstanding securities that could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by us or our affiliates could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 
anti takeover provisions in our amended articles of incorporation and bylaws  mississippi law  and our shareholder rights plan could make a third party acquisition of us difficult and may adversely affect share value 
our amended articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders and for holders of our securities to receive any related takeover premium for their securities 
in addition  under our shareholder rights plan  rights are issued to all hancock common shareholders that  if activated upon an attempted unfriendly acquisition  would allow our shareholders to buy our common stock at a reduced price  thereby minimizing the risk of any potential hostile takeover 
we are also subject to certain provisions of state and federal law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us 
under federal law  subject to certain exemptions  a person  entity  or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company  including our shares 
banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control 
the banking agencies have days to act on the notice  and take into account several factors  including the resources of the acquirer and the antitrust effects of the acquisition 
there also are mississippi statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt 
as a result  these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
governmental responses to recent market disruptions may be inadequate and may have unintended consequences 
in response to recent market disruptions  legislators and financial regulators have taken a number of steps to stabilize the financial markets 
these steps include the enactment and partial implementation of the emergency economic stabilization act of  the provision of other direct and indirect assistance to financial institutions  assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  implementation of programs by the federal reserve board to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and expansion of deposit insurance coverage 
the administration and congress have pursued additional initiatives to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets  including the enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and have altered the terms of some previously announced policies 
the overall effects of these and other legislative and regulatory efforts on the financial markets are uncertain 
should these or other legislative or regulatory initiatives fail to stabilize the financial markets  the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  the implementation of the dodd frank act will likely result in significant changes to the banking industry as a whole which  depending on how its provisions are implemented by the agencies  could adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  the company competes with a number of financial services companies that are not subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight to which the company is subject 
the impact of the existing regulatory framework and any future changes to it could negatively affect the company s ability to compete with these institutions  which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and prospects

executive overview recent economic and industry developments recent reports from the federal reserve indicate slow  but steady improvement of economic activity throughout most of hancock s market areas 
activity at energy related businesses operating mainly in hancock s south louisiana and houston  texas market areas remained at high levels that are expected to continue in  despite low prices for natural gas 
there is some concern regarding the availability of a shortage of specialized skilled labor needed to further expand activity in this industry 
tourism and convention activity  which is important to several of the company s market areas  also remained strong with a positive near term outlook 
retail sales activity is generally improved from prior year levels  although there is room for additional improvement and buying behavior suggest consumers remain conservative in managing their personal finances 
manufacturing activity has shown mixed results  with current performance and near term prospects varied among the different sectors 
uncertainties regarding such matters as the health of the international economy  domestic fiscal and tax policy  changing regulations  and costs associated with proposed regulations and coming healthcare provisions  have led manufacturers to remain cautious about expanding operations and increasing hiring 
the real estate market for both residential and commercial properties continues to show some improvement 
home sales are growing modestly year over year  with the strongest growth in florida  and prices are stabilizing and trending higher in most markets 
new home construction activity is also showing some continued improvement 
the sustainability of a housing market recovery will be sensitive to the continued availability of attractive financing rates  the ability of prospective homeowners to meet underwriting standards  the rate of foreclosed properties entering the market and consumer expectations about future economic conditions  among other factors 
commercial construction activity has improved modestly  with apartment development particularly strong 
absorption rates in office  industrial and retail property markets have been modestly positive  and the prospect is improving for some increase in commercial real estate investment and construction activity 
growth in commercial construction will depend in large part on continued improvement in overall economic activity and increased confidence that these improvements can be sustained 
employment growth was generally positive across hancock s market area  with recent strong growth in florida and louisiana 
the unemployment rates in several market areas have generally tracked lower than the national level throughout the recent recession and slow recovery 
uncertainty over fiscal policy and healthcare costs have tempered some employers hiring decisions 
pricing pressures remain subdued  but employment costs related to tax policy  regulation and healthcare are concerns of many businesses 
loan demand across most of the markets that hancock serves has increased  but competition for quality borrowers remains stiff 
auto lending  mortgage lending on both new and existing homes  energy lending and some commercial real estate development financing all had expanded activity 
the overall us economy continued to expand  with most all regions showing modest to moderate growth rates 
confidence in the prospect of a higher rate of sustained growth is improving for businesses and consumers alike  although uncertainties remain about such matters as the health of the international economy and the implications of pending or proposed changes in us fiscal and tax policies and regulations 
the federal reserve has responded to the slow recovery from the deep recession by taking steps to hold interest rates at unprecedented low levels and has expressed its intent to maintain rates at these levels pending further improvement in the unemployment rate 
the dodd frank act that was signed into law in july significantly overhauled many aspects of the financial services industry and includes provisions that have had or likely will have an impact on the nature and pricing of services offered by the banks and other financial services industry participants 
the independent consumer financial protection bureau that was established under the dodd frank act has broad rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products  including deposit products  residential mortgages  home equity loans and credit cards 
the dodd frank act directs applicable regulatory authorities to promulgate a large number of regulations implementing its provisions over time 
the cfpb now conducts consumer compliance examinations of the banks 
acquisition of whitney holding corporation on june   hancock acquired whitney holding corporation  the parent of whitney national bank based in new orleans  louisiana  in a stock and cash transaction 
the total purchase price was approximately billion  including million hancock common shares issued to whitney common shareholders at a fair value of billion and million paid by the company to purchase and subsequently retire whitney s preferred stock and common stock warrant that had been issued under tarp 
the fair value of the assets acquired  excluding goodwill  totaled billion  and included billion in loans  billion of investment securities  and million of identifiable intangible assets 
liabilities assumed were billion  including billion of deposits 
whitney national bank served the five state gulf coast region stretching from houston  texas  across southern louisiana and the coastal region of mississippi  to central and south alabama  the panhandle of florida  and the metropolitan area of tampa  florida 
highlights of financial results net income for the year ended december  was million  almost double the million net income in this increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the acquired whitney operations and lower merger related expenses in diluted earnings per share for were  a increase from diluted earnings per share on operating income  which excludes tax effected merger related expenses  debt reduction costs and securities gains and losses  were for  an improvement over hancock s return on average assets roa for was compared to for  while the operating roa increased to in  up basis points from net interest income te in totaled million  a million increase over average earning assets in were up almost over  related mainly to the whitney acquisition in june the reported net interest margin widened basis points to in  reflecting a relatively stable yield on earning assets and a further decline in funding costs 
asset yields were supported by the continued favorable performance of whitney s acquired loan portfolio and an increase in interest income recognized on the portfolio under purchase accounting 
the core net interest margin  which is calculated excluding total net purchase accounting adjustments  has compressed some during  mainly on lower core yields on the loan and securities portfolios 
the provision for loan losses was million in compared to million in  with each related mainly to loans not covered under fdic loss sharing agreements 
approximately million of the provision was associated with a bulk sale of non covered problem loans toward the end of that year 
net charge offs from the non covered portfolio during were million or of average total loans  including million related to the bulk loan sale 
this compares to the net non covered charge offs of million  or of average total loans  in the determination of allowances for covered loans and other loans acquired with existing credit impairment is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total assets at december  were billion  down less than from the prior year end 
total loans increased million during  and were up million excluding the fdic covered portfolio 
during  net growth primarily in commercial non real estate c i loans  but also in residential mortgages and consumer loans  was partially offset by net reductions in construction and land development and commercial real estate credits 
the banks increased their level of liquidity investments toward the end of to address the potential for some run off of deposits in early following the expiration of a special deposit insurance program 
no material outflows were noted and the excess liquidity will be redeployed during the first quarter of at december   deposits in total were up slightly from the end of  as growth in noninterest bearing and lower rate interest bearing deposits outpaced the run off of higher rate time deposits 
noninterest bearing demand deposits increased and comprised of total deposits at december  results of operations net interest income net interest income tax equivalent or te is the primary component of our earnings and represents the difference  or spread  between revenue generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense related to funding those assets 
for internal analytical purposes  management adjusts net interest income to a taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate on tax exempt items primarily interest on municipal securities and loans 
net interest income te for totaled million  a million increase over average earning assets in were up almost over  reflecting mainly the whitney acquisition in june the reported net interest margin improved basis points bps to in the net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income te to average earnings assets 
the core margin net interest margin calculated excluding total net purchase accounting adjustments was approximately in the core margin has compressed bps during to approximately in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of  mainly from a decline in the core yields on the loan and securities portfolios 
the reported net interest margin was stable to slightly higher during whitney s acquired portfolio continued to perform better than expected over this period 
as a result  re projections of expected cash flows from the acquired portfolio led to increased loan accretion that favorably impacted both net interest income and the net interest margin 
changes in activity related to prepayments and payoffs in the acquired portfolio can cause quarterly accretion levels to be volatile 
the overall reported yield on earning assets was in  down bps from the reported loan portfolio yield of in was up bps from recent growth in commercial loans has been in very competitively priced segments  but the increasing yield recognized on the acquired portfolio has helped to support the overall loan yield 
the reported yield on the mainly fixed rate portfolio of investment securities declined bps from  reflecting both lower yields available on the reinvestment of repayments and maturities and the market yield on whitney s securities portfolio at the acquisition date 
the mix of average earning assets improved moderately in  as the proportion of loans increased to of earnings assets compared to in with a corresponding decline in short term investments 
the cost of funding earning assets declined to in  down bps from the overall rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined bps from to in this decrease was due primarily to the impact of the sustained low rate environment on deposit rates in general and on the re pricing of time deposits in particular 
the opportunity to re price time deposits at significantly lower rates over the near term has largely been eliminated 
the mix of funding sources improved during  related mainly to the full year effect of the composition of the acquired whitney deposit base 
interest free sources  including non interest bearing demand deposits  funded of average earnings assets in compared to in as earning assets continue to re price at lower rates  and with little opportunity to further reduce funding costs  management expects continued compression in the core net interest margin in the near term 
all else equal  some near term compression in the reported margin is also anticipated 
net interest income te for totaled million  almost double the million earned in earning assets in were up over  reflecting mainly the whitney acquisition  and the net interest margin improved by basis points to in the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to in loan yields increased basis points to in  while the yield on the investment portfolio declined basis points from positive adjustments to the yield earned on the acquired whitney portfolio based on post merger portfolio performance benefited the overall loan yield in the overall mix of average earning assets was relatively stable between and  with loans comprising approximately of the total in each year 
the cost of funding earning assets decreased basis points to in the overall rate paid on interest bearing deposits was down basis points from to in  reflecting mainly the impact of the sustained low rate environment on deposit rates and the expected runoff or re pricing of higher rate time deposits from the people s first acquisition 
there was a favorable shift in the mix of funding sources during  related mainly to the composition of the acquired whitney deposit base

approximately million of the loans sold were previously reported as nonperforming loans 
the remaining million of loans sold were acquired credit impaired credits that were not reported as nonperforming loans under purchase accounting 
the sale added million to the provision for loan losses  and million to net charge offs for specific reserves totaling million had been previously recorded on loans included in the sale 
the credits sold had a total of approximately million in remaining contractual principal 
during  the company recorded a million increase in the allowance for losses related to impairment of certain pools of covered loans  with a related increase of million in the company s fdic loss share receivable 
the net impact on provision expense was million in compared to million in decreases in the expected cash flows on covered loans are recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding increase to the loss share receivable  and the difference is recorded as a provision for loan losses in the consolidated statement of income

noninterest income noninterest income for totaled million  a million increase from the full year impact of the acquired whitney operations in was the primary factor behind this overall increase 
income from service charges on deposit accounts increased million in compared to the company began offering new and standardized products and services across its footprint in conjunction with the core systems integration in march the additional revenue generated from these product changes supplemented the increase of service charge income from the full year impact of whitney s operations 
service charges include periodic account maintenance fees for both commercial and personal customers  charges for specific transactions or services  such as processing return items or wire transfers  and other revenue associated with deposit accounts  such as commissions on check sales 
bank card fees were up  but would have shown a decline excluding the full year impact of whitney s operations 
restrictions on debit card interchange rates that arose from the implementation of the durbin amendment to the dodd frank act began impacting whitney bank in the fourth quarter of and hancock bank at the beginning of the third quarter of the restrictions reduced whitney bank fees by approximately million per quarter and hancock bank fees by approximately million per quarter 
the durbin interchange restrictions also negatively impacted atm fees beginning in the third quarter of these revenue losses were partially offset by an increase in merchant processing revenue starting with the third quarter of that was related to the reacquisition of the company s merchant business and a change in the terms of the servicing agreement 
fees from secondary mortgage market operations increased million in compared to in addition to the favorable impact from a full year of whitney s operations in  the company s origination volume and fees benefited as consumers took advantage of historically low rates to refinance or purchase their homes in an improving economic environment 
fluctuations in the accretion on the fdic loss share receivable reflect changes in the amount and timing of projected cash flows related to the reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements 
these projections are updated as loss estimates related to the various covered loan pools change 
noninterest income for totaled million  a million increase over excluding the estimated impact of the whitney acquisition  noninterest income was up million  or 
an million increase in the accretion of the fdic loss share receivable and improvements in several other income categories were partly offset by a million reduction in service charge revenue from legacy hancock customers 
investment brokerage and annuity sales fees from legacy hancock operations increased million due mainly to improved financial market conditions

normal salary adjustments  additional incentive based compensation and some strategic staff additions appropriate to the company s expanded scope of operations following the whitney acquisition and increases in both health and pension benefits were the primary components of this increase 
deposit insurance and regulatory fees decreased million in  excluding expenses associated with whitney s operations 
the implementation of a new deposit insurance assessment calculation method in had a favorable impact on the banks premiums 
excluding the impact of the whitney acquisition  no significant trends were identified underlying the changes in other noninterest expense categories between and income taxes income tax expense was million in  million in and million in our effective income tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate of  due primarily to tax exempt income and tax credits

segment reporting the company s primary operating segments consist of the hancock segment  which coincides generally with the company s hancock bank subsidiary  and the whitney segment  which coincides generally with its whitney bank subsidiary 
each bank segment offers commercial  consumer and mortgage loans and deposit services  as well as certain other services  such as trust and treasury management services 
although the bank segments offer the same products and services  they are managed separately due to different pricing  product demand  and consumer markets 
on june   the company completed its acquisition of whitney holding corporation  the parent of whitney national bank 
whitney national bank was merged into hancock bank of louisiana  and the combined entity was renamed whitney bank 
on march   whitney bank transferred the assets and liabilities of its operations in florida  alabama and mississippi to hancock bank 
the transfer included approximately billion of earning assets and a comparable amount of deposits 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides comparative financial information for the reportable operating segments for   and in the tables in note  the other column includes activities of other consolidated subsidiaries and the holding company which do not constitute reportable segments under the relevant accounting guidelines 
these subsidiaries provide investment services  insurance agency services  insurance underwriting and various other services to third parties 
of the company s total operating income of million for  the hancock segment generated approximately million and the whitney segment generated approximately million 
operating income is defined as net income less tax effected merger related expenses  debt redemption costs and securities transactions 
operating income was up million over for the hancock segment and million for the whitney segment  with each increase reflecting primarily the full year impact of whitney s acquired operations and the reorganization of these operations in march net interest income for both the hancock and whitney segments also benefited from an increased rate of accretion on the purchased loan portfolios during the hancock segment includes the fdic covered portfolio as well as a portion of the portfolio acquired in the whitney transaction  while the whitney segment includes the majority of the whitney acquired loans 
a decrease in the accretion on the fdic loss share receivable in reduced the hancock segment s noninterest income by million compared to the bulk sale of problem loans toward the end of added approximately million to the provision for loan losses for the hancock segment and million to the provision for the whitney segment 
there was a small decrease for in the hancock segment s provision associated with the fdic covered portfolio 
excluding the impact of the bulk loan sale in late  the whitney segment s provision for loan losses increased approximately million compared to  reflecting both loan growth and the impact of a moderate increase in non performing loans and charge offs associated with a limited number of originated commercial credits in louisiana markets and some smaller dollar residential mortgage and commercial credits from the whitney acquired performing portfolio 
the cost savings realized as whitney s operations were successfully integrated into hancock are primarily reflected in the comparative results of the whitney segment 
balance sheet analysis investment securities our investment in securities was billion at december   compared to billion at december  the decline of million from the end of reflects mainly the use of proceeds from maturities and scheduled repayments to fund the net loan growth and reduction in short term borrowings discussed below 
also as discussed later  the company opted to maintain additional short term liquidity balances at the end of in anticipation of possible increased demands on liquidity as a result of the expiration of the fdic s transaction account guarantee tag program 
at december   all securities were classified as available for sale 
at december   we had billion in available for sale securities and billion in held to maturity 
during the first quarter of  the company reclassified approximately billion of securities available for sale as securities held to maturity 
as a result of the acquisition of whitney national bank  the securities portfolio increased to a level that caused us to conclude that only a portion of the portfolio is needed to be held for sale for liquidity purposes 
the securities reclassified consisted primarily of cmos and in market municipal securities 
the securities were transferred at fair value  which became the cost basis for the securities held to maturity 
the unrealized net holding gain on the available for sale securities on the date of transfer totaled approximately million  and continued to be reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this net unrealized gain is being accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment  which serves to offset the impact of the amortization of the net premium created in the transfer 
there were no gains or losses recognized as a result of this transfer 
our securities portfolio consists mainly of residential mortgage backed securities and cmos that are issued or guaranteed by us government agencies 
the portfolio is designed to enhance liquidity while providing an acceptable rate of return 
we invest only in high quality securities of investment grade quality with a targeted duration  for the overall portfolio  generally between two to five years  at december   the average maturity of the portfolio was years with an effective duration of years and a weighted average yield of 
at december   the average maturity of the portfolio was years with an effective duration of years and a weighted average yield of 
there were no investments in securities of a single issuer  other than us treasury and us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies that exceeded of stockholders equity 
we do not invest in subprime or alt a home mortgage loans 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with held to maturity securities carried at amortized cost

excluding the fdic covered portfolio acquired with peoples first  total loans were up million compared to year end during  net growth in commercial non real estate c i  residential mortgage and consumer loans was partially offset by net reductions in construction and land development c d and commercial real estate cre credits 
hancock s loan pipeline remains strong  but the market for new loans remains highly competitive 
although management expects continued net loan growth in future quarters  the rate of growth may be below that experienced over the last half of the assessment and monitoring of the risk and performance of the loan portfolio is currently performed at the aggregate levels of commercial  residential mortgage and consumer  where the commercial category includes c i  c d  and cre loans 
as a result  we have historically reported credit quality information at these aggregate levels  without further break out of the commercial category 
we are in the process of enhancing certain aspects of our allowance methodology and credit risk monitoring activities that will include refining certain data and reporting methods and that will lead to a higher level of disaggregation of the commercial loan portfolio for purposes of reporting credit quality statistical information in future periods 
we intend to have these new processes and refinements operational in we provide the more detailed breakout of commercial loans where the information is currently available in the following loan tables 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the composition of our loan portfolio distinguished among loans originated  acquired and covered 
table loans outstanding by type december  in thousands originated loans commercial non real estate construction and land development commercial real estate residential mortgages consumer total originated loans acquired loans commercial non real estate construction and land development commercial real estate residential mortgages consumer total acquired loans covered loans commercial non real estate construction and land development commercial real estate residential mortgages consumer total covered loans total loans commercial non real estate construction and land development commercial real estate residential mortgages consumer total loans originated loans include all loans not included in the acquired and covered loan portfolios described below 
acquired loans are those purchased in the whitney acquisition on june   including loans that were performing satisfactorily at the date acquired performing and loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration acquired impaired 
covered loans are those purchased in the december acquisition of peoples first  which are covered by loss share agreements between the fdic and the company that afford significant loss protection 
purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date without carryover of any allowance for loan losses 
certain differences in the accounting for originated loans and for acquired performing and acquired impaired loans which include all covered loans are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
originated c i loans were up billion since december  the net increase reflected activity with both new and existing customers  including certain activity with relationships acquired in the whitney acquisition 
considered together  originated and acquired c i loans increased a combined million during while most markets across the company s footprint reported c i growth  the most significant activity was concentrated in the company s market areas in louisiana  the houston  texas market  and several florida market areas  with a sizeable portion of the new business generated from customers in the oil and gas energy sector 
the company s commercial customer base is diversified over a range of industries  including oil and gas o g  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  marine transportation and maritime construction  financial and professional services  and agricultural production 
loans outstanding to o g industry customers totaled approximately million at december   up approximately million from december  the majority of the o g portfolio is with customers who provide transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
the banks c i lending is mainly to middle market and smaller commercial entities  although they do occasionally participate in larger shared credit loan facilities with businesses well known to the relationship officers and operating in the company s market areas 
shared credits funded at december  totaled approximately billion  of which approximately million was with o g customers 
originated c d loans and originated commercial real estate cre loans  which include loans on both income producing and owner occupied properties  increased a combined million during  with million of net growth in the fourth quarter 
this increase reflects the funding of existing commitments as well as some new business across the company s footprint and covers a variety of retail  multi family residential  commercial and other projects  including some sizable projects to expand or renovate established properties in louisiana 
overall  however  opportunities for funding new quality projects in today s environment remain limited 
originated residential mortgages were up million during  and originated consumer loans increased million over this period 
the company has increased its emphasis on residential mortgages to be held in the loan portfolio  and customer demand has been supported by historically low interest rates for home loans 
lending campaigns for indirect auto loans and home equity loans initiated in the second quarter of contributed to the growth in the originated consumer portfolio 
the portfolio of acquired whitney loans has declined billion since december   with a million decline in the c i category  million in the c d and cre categories  and million in the residential mortgage and consumer loans categories 
there were no significant trends underlying the reduction in the c i category  and  as noted earlier the company continues its relationship with many of the commercial customers who have paid down their loans since the acquisition 
reductions in acquired c d and cre categories as well as the residential mortgage and consumer categories reflected mainly normal repayment and refinancing activity 
total covered loans at december  were down million from december  these reductions reflect normal repayments  charge offs and foreclosures 
the covered portfolio will continue to decline over the terms of the loss share agreements

ore and foreclosed assets decreased a net million during  reflecting in part some significant sales of legacy whitney properties 
non accrual loans were million at december   an increase of million from december  the net increase in non accrual loans since the end of reflects mainly the movement to non accrual status of a small number of legacy hancock credits  primarily cre credits and a few c i credits located in louisiana 
the increase also includes certain whitney acquired performing loans that have moved to non accrual consisting mainly of smaller dollar residential mortgage and commercial credits  primarily located in louisiana 
covered loans and whitney acquired impaired loans were accounted for as loans with prior credit impairment at acquisition and are considered to be performing and accruing due to the application of the accretion method to the underlying loan pools 
covered loans accounted for using the cost recovery method and reported as non accrual totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
acquired performing loans subsequently placed in non accrual status totaled million at december  and million at december  loans modified in troubled debt restructurings tdrs totaled million at december  compared to million at december  these totals included million and million  respectively  of loans reported with non accrual loans 
tdrs arise when a borrower is experiencing  or is expected to experience  financial difficulties in the near term and  consequently  a modification that would otherwise not be considered is granted to the borrower 
certain loans modified in a tdr may continue to accrue interest  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower 
ore and foreclosed assets decreased a net million during net reductions were realized both for those assets covered by fdic loss sharing agreements and for non covered assets and reflected in part the prudent use of auctions for certain covered assets as well as the sale of some significant legacy whitney properties 
the company had ore with a total carrying value of approximately million under contract at december   with the sales expected to close in the first quarter of a relatively high rate of additions to covered ore is expected in the near term as covered loans continue to move through the foreclosure process 
allowance for loan and lease losses management  with audit committee oversight  is responsible for maintaining an effective loan review system  and internal controls  which include an effective risk rating system that identifies  monitors  and addresses asset quality problems in an accurate and timely manner 
the allowance is evaluated for adequacy on at least a quarterly basis 
for a discussion of this process  see note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million compared with million at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses as a percent of period end loans was at december   compared to at december  the increase in the allowance since the end of was related mainly to the portfolio covered under fdic loss sharing agreements

the banks have not experienced any material outflow of deposits as a result of the tag program expiration  and excess liquidity investments will be redeployed by management during the first quarter of deposits total deposits at december  were billion  basically flat from december  noninterest bearing demand deposits ddas at december  totaled billion  a million increase during the year 
the proportion of ddas in the overall deposit mix improved slightly to at the end of approximately million of ddas were converted to low cost interest bearing transaction accounts during the core system conversion in march in order to best match the existing product benefits offered 
total interest bearing deposits declined less than during time deposits cds decreased by million reflecting mainly the renewal rates available during this sustained period of low market interest rates 
of the balance of cds that matured during at an average rate of approximately  approximately two thirds renewed at an average rate of approximately 
the decrease in cds included the expected runoff of some of the remaining high priced deposits in the peoples first deposit base

these cds were issued as a temporary liquidity source related to the year end expiration of the tag program discussed above in the section on short term investments 
the brokered cds have maturities of or months and an average rate of approximately 
the banks have not experienced any material outflow of deposits as a result of the tag program expiration 
interest bearing transaction and savings deposits increased million during  reflecting in part some movement of balance from maturing cds and the conversion of certain dda accounts to low cost interest bearing accounts as discussed earlier 
interest bearing public fund deposits declined million from the end of to december  public fund deposits typically reflect higher balances at year end due to seasonal cash inflows to these public entities  with subsequent reductions beginning in the first quarter of the following year 
in the current low rate environment  management expects customers will continue to hold funds in no or low cost transaction accounts until rates begin to rise 
table shows deposits for each year in the three year period ended december  as well as the percentage of total deposits for each category

customer repurchase agreements are the main source of such borrowings in each year 
these agreements are offered mainly to commercial customers to assist them with their ongoing cash management strategies or to provide a temporary investment vehicle for their excess liquidity pending redeployment for corporate or investment purposes 
while customer repurchase agreements provide a recurring source of funds to the banks  the amounts available over time can be volatile

such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded  although they expose the banks to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans 
commitments to extend credit include revolving commercial credit lines  nonrevolving loan commitments issued mainly to finance the acquisition and development of construction of real property or equipment  and credit card and personal credit lines 
the availability of funds under commercial credit lines and loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates 
a number of commercial and personal credit lines are used only partially or  in some cases  not at all before they expire  and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the company 
a substantial majority of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the banks to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the banks issue standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to their customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors of essential goods and services 
the contract amounts of these instruments reflect the company s exposure to credit risk 
the banks undertake the same credit evaluation in making loan commitments and assuming conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support

enterprise risk management helps preserve shareholder value by assessing  monitoring  and managing the risks associated with our business 
strong risk management practices foster enhanced decision making  facilitate successful implementation of new initiatives  and  where appropriate  support acceptance of greater levels of risk to drive growth and achieve strategic objectives 
the company s risk management culture integrates a board approved risk appetite with senior management direction and governance to facilitate the execution of the company s strategic plan 
this integration ensures the daily management of risks by business lines and continuous corporate monitoring of the levels of risk in each business line and across the company 
risk categories and definitions the primary risk exposures of the company are credit  market  liquidity  operational  legal  reputational  and strategic 
the company has adopted the risk categories outlined by the federal reserve to govern the risk management of bank holding companies 
the risk categories are credit risk arises from a borrower or counterparty s failure to perform on an obligation 
market risk resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  or equity prices 
liquidity risk rising from our inability to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or from an inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions 
operational risk arising from inadequate information systems  operational problems  breaches in internal controls  fraud  or unforeseen catastrophes that result in unexpected losses 
legal risk arising from unenforceable contracts  lawsuits  or adverse judgments that disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of the company 
reputational risk arising from negative publicity about the company s business practices  whether true or not  will cause a decline in the customer base  costly litigation  or revenue reductions 
strategic risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions 
this risk is a function of the compatibility of a company s strategic goals  the business strategies developed to achieve those goals  the resources deployed against these goals  and the quality of implementation 
as a component of the company s risk management program these risk categories are organized into four risk classifications or genres that are reflected in the company s portfolio risk committees 
the company s risk categories are credit focusing specifically on credit risk market including risk categories of liquidity  interest rate and market risk operational including risk categories of operational  legal  and compliance risk strategic including risk categories of strategic and reputational risk risk committee governance structure effective risk management governance requires active oversight  participation  and interaction by and between the board of directors and senior management 
our enterprise risk management framework uses a tiered risk reward committee structure to facilitate the timely discussion of significant risk issues and risk mitigation strategies and or tactics 
risk committees exist at the board  management and portfolio levels 
board level committee 
the board risk committee is the senior risk reward committee of the company responsible for establishing our risk tolerance  reviewing enterprise risk positions and strategic activities  and providing oversight of senior management s strategic decisions and risk responses 
the board risk committee is chaired by an independent director who meets the risk management qualifications outlined in dodd frank 
management level committees 
the company has two management level risk reward committees that oversee the business strategy  organizational structure  and capital and liquidity strategies for the company 
these committees also provide oversight of the portfolio risk reward committees to ensure tactics to address business strategy changes are properly vetted and adopted 
the capital committee capco is the senior most management committee charged with corporate business strategy development and the capital plan management 
the executive committee exco is the management committee responsible for business strategy execution  corporate financial oversight  and portfolio risk committee governance and oversight 
the ceo s report to the board and are the co chairs of capco and exco 
portfolio level committees 
the company has four portfolio risk reward committees focusing on credit  market  operational  and strategic risk categories 
these committees review and monitor the risk categories in a portfolio context ensuring risk assessment and management processes are being effectively executed to identify and manage risk 
the committees also monitor the risk portfolios for changes to the company s risk profile as well as ensure the risk portfolio is performing within the board approved tolerance for risk 
portfolio committees report to exco 
risk leadership and organization the risk management organization of the company is led by the chief risk officer 
the chief risk officer reports to the chief executive officer and provides overall vision  direction and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management program 
the chief risk officer exercises independent judgment and reporting of risk through a direct working relationship with the board risk committee 
the functional areas reporting to the chief risk officer are the enterprise risk management program office  operational risk management  credit risk management which includes loan review  appraisal  and credit risk analytics  regulatory relations and the enterprise wide compliance program 
the chief risk officer also works closely with the chief internal auditor to provide assurance to the board and senior management regarding risk management controls and their effectiveness 
the chief internal auditor reports to the board audit committee to assure independence of the internal audit function 
credit risk the banks primary lending focus is to provide commercial  consumer  and real estate loans to consumers  to small and middle market businesses  to corporate clients in their respective market areas  and to state  county  and municipal government entities 
diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of reducing the risks associated with economic fluctuations 
the banks have no significant concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or foreign entities 
the banks monitor real estate lending concentrations throughout the year  and do not have any commercial real estate concentrations  as defined by interagency guidelines 
the banks have actively decreased their exposure to residential construction development lending over the course of the last several years 
considering national housing trends  local market demand for housing  price softness in some markets  population migration trends  as well as general economic conditions  the company will continue to closely monitor this type of lending 
third party valuations are obtained at the time of origination for real estate secured loans 
when a determination is made that a loan has deteriorated to the point of becoming a problem loan  updated valuations may be ordered to help determine if there is impairment  leading to a recommendation for partial charge off or appropriate allowance allocation 
the impairment on collateral dependent loans is measured against the fair value of the collateral for the loan less cost estimated selling 
property valuations are ordered through  and reviewed by  the banks appraisal department 
the banks typically order an as is valuation for collateral property if the loan is in a criticized loan classification 
the banks maintain an active loan review function to help ensure that developing credit problems are captured and recognized in a timely manner 
further  an active watch list review routine is in place as part of the banks problem loan management strategy and a list of loans days past due and still accruing is reviewed with management  including the chief credit officer  at least monthly 
recommendations flow from all of the above activities to recognize non performing loans and determine accrual status 
asset liability management asset liability management consists of quantifying  analyzing and controlling interest rate risk irr to maintain stability in net interest income under varying interest rate environments 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable risk limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of liquidity 
our net earnings are materially dependent on our net interest income 
irr on the company s balance sheets consists of re price  option  yield curve  and basis risks 
re price risk results from differences in the maturity or re pricing of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the company 
yield curve risk refers to the risk resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as savings accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal accounts  and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the asset liability committee alco manages our irr exposures through pro active measurement  monitoring  and management actions 
alco strives to maintain levels of irr within limits approved by the board of directors through a risk management policy that is designed to produce a stable net interest margin in periods of interest rate fluctuation 
accordingly  the company s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by its alco  which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
the company utilizes an asset liability model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates 
the model is used to perform net interest income  economic value of equity  and gap analyses 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next months and month periods 
the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next months 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
the impact of interest rate derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors  is also included in the model 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
net interest income at risk net interest income at risk measures the risk of a change in earnings due to changes in interest rates 
table presents an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in net interest income resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in the yield curve at december  shifts are measured in basis point increments in a range of as much as basis points through basis points presented in table from base case 
base case encompasses key assumptions for asset liability mix  loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds  deposit decay rates  securities portfolio cash flows and reinvestment strategy  and the market value of certain assets 
the base case scenario assumes that the current interest rate environment is held constant throughout the month forecast period  the instantaneous shocks are performed against that yield curve 
during the third quarter of  the asset liability committee made a decision  as a precaution  to increase its level of overnight liquidity in the fourth quarter of against potential deposit run off due to the expiration of tag 
this elevated level of liquidity  combined with normal  seasonal increases in deposits at year end resulted in an elevated level of interest rate risk sensitivity as of december  management subsequently determined that tag expiration had not resulted in a significant outflow of deposits and redeployed much of the elevated level of liquidity from overnight federal funds to the securities portfolio 
this redeployment of liquidity in the first quarter of will reduce the company s interest rate risk to levels more consistent with prior periods 
table net interest income te at risk change in interest rates estimated increase decrease in nii december  basis points stable note decrease in interest rates discontinued in current rate environment these scenarios are instantaneous shocks that assume balance sheet management will mirror base case 
should the yield curve begin to rise or fall  management has strategies available to maximize earnings opportunities or offset the negative impact to earnings 
for example  in a rising rate environment  deposit pricing strategies could be adjusted to offer more competitive rates on long and medium term cds and less competitive rates on short term cds 
another opportunity at the start of such a cycle would be reinvesting the securities portfolio cash flows into short term or floating rate securities 
on the loan side the company can make more floating rate loans that tie to indices that re price more frequently  such as libor london interbank offered rate and make fewer fixed rate loans 
finally  there are a number of hedge strategies by which management could use derivatives  including swaps and purchased ceilings  to lock in net interest margin protection 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as anticipated 
additionally  a change in the us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the us treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to nii than indicated above 
strategic management of our balance sheet and earnings is fluid and would be adjusted to accommodate these movements 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
also  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all of these factors in monitoring exposure to interest rate risk 
liquidity liquidity management is focused on ensuring that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers  while also meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company  the banks and other subsidiaries 
hancock develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and occasional sales of various assets 
short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank or with other commercial banks are additional sources of liquidity to meet cash flow requirements 
as shown in table below  our ratios of free securities to total securities were and  respectively  at december  and free securities represent securities that are not pledged for any purpose  and include unpledged securities assigned to short term dealer repo agreements or to the federal reserve bank discount window 
table liquidity metrics free securities total securities noncore deposits total deposits wholesale funds core deposits the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
core deposits represent total less cds of  or more  brokered deposits  and foreign branch deposits 
as discussed earlier  the banks issued million of brokered cds toward the end of as a precautionary measure in anticipation of possible deposit outflows associated with the expiration of the fdic tag program at december  the banks have not experienced any material deposit outflows in early non core deposits were of total deposits at december   compared to a year earlier 
purchases of federal funds  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity to meet short term funding requirements 
wholesale funds  which represent short term borrowings and long term debt  were of core deposits at december  and at december  our short term borrowing capacity includes an approved line of credit with the federal home loan bank of billion and borrowing capacity at the federal reserve s discount window in excess of billion at december  no amounts had been borrowed under these lines at year end cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each of the three years in the period ended december  dividends received from the banks have been the primary source of funds available to the company for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for servicing any debt issued by the holding company 
the liquidity management process recognizes the various regulatory provisions that can limit the amount of dividends that the banks can distribute to the company  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
it is the company s policy to maintain assets at the holding company to provide liquidity sufficient to fund five quarters of anticipated stockholder dividends  debt service and operations 
contractual obligations table summarizes all significant contractual obligations at december   according to payments due by period 
obligations under deposit contracts and short term borrowings are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services and goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
not included are contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty 
table contractual obligations payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total capital resources a strong capital position  which is vital to continued profitability  also promotes depositor and investor confidence and provides a solid foundation for future growth and flexibility in addressing strategic opportunities 
stockholders equity totaled billion at december   up million from december  our tangible common equity ratio increased to at the end of  compared to at december  the primary quantitative measures that regulators use to gauge capital adequacy are the ratios of total and tier regulatory capital to risk weighted assets risk based capital ratios and the ratio of tier capital to average total assets leverage ratio 
both the company and the banks are required to maintain minimum risk based capital ratios of total regulatory capital and tier capital 
the minimum leverage ratio is for bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest supervisory rating 
all others are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
at december   our capital balances and those of the banks were well in excess of current regulatory minimum requirements 
table below shows the company s regulatory ratios for the past five years 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the banks regulatory capital ratios 
the company and the banks have been categorized as well capitalized in the most recent notices received from our regulators 
all of the company s regulatory capital ratios increased during tier and total regulatory capital grew primarily on the earnings retained for and the elimination of certain reductions to regulatory capital required for a period of time after the whitney acquisition 
the reduction in tier regulatory capital related mainly to the partial redemption of whitney bank s subordinated debt 
risk weighted assets grew moderately during reflecting mainly the growth in loans which generally carry higher risk weightings than other earnings assets 
the decline in regulatory ratios during reflected the impact of the whitney acquisition

the following discussion highlights recent factors impacting hancock s results of operations and financial position 
total loans at december  were billion  an increase of million from september  the net loan growth was mainly generated in the commercial and industrial c i portfolio  most notably in louisiana and houston  home to a significant part of the gulf coast s energy sector 
excluding the fdic covered portfolio  which declined approximately million during the fourth quarter  and excluding the reduction from the bulk loan sale of approximately million  total loans were up million from september  this compares to an increase of million during the fourth quarter of total deposits at december  were billion  up billion from september  the fourth quarter increase reflected year end seasonality of both commercial and public fund customers 
historically  both legacy hancock and legacy whitney customers have built deposits at year end  with some of those deposits leaving in the first quarter  particularly in demand deposits 
noninterest bearing demand deposits ddas totaled billion at december   up million compared to september  ddas comprised of total period end deposits at december   up slightly from september  interest bearing public fund deposits totaled billion at year end  up million compared to september  dda and public fund deposits typically reflect higher balances at year end with subsequent reductions beginning in the first quarter 
time deposits  primarily certificates of deposits cds  totaled billion at december   up million from september  in november of  the company issued million in brokered cds as a temporary liquidity source in anticipation of the year end expiration of the fdic transaction account guarantee tag program 
the company has not experienced any material outflow of deposits as a result of the tag expiration 
hancock recorded a total provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of of million  up from million in the third quarter of excluding the impact of the bulk sale  provision expense for the fourth quarter of was million 
the provision for non covered loans  excluding the impact of the bulk sale  increased to million in the fourth quarter of from million in the third quarter of net charge offs from the non covered loan portfolio were million  or of average total loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter 
excluding the impact of the bulk sale  non covered net charge offs for the fourth quarter of were million  or of average total loans  compared to million  or of average total loans  for the third quarter of net charge offs from previously impaired loan pools in the covered portfolio were million for the fourth quarter of net interest income te for the fourth quarter of was million  up from million in the third quarter of average earning assets were billion in the fourth quarter of  up million from the third quarter of the net interest margin te was for the fourth quarter of  down basis points bps from in the third quarter of the core margin of reported net interest income te excluding total net purchase accounting adjustments  annualized  as a percent of total earning assets compressed approximately bps during the fourth quarter  mainly from a decline in both the core yield on the loan and the securities portfolios 
the margin was favorably impacted by changes in the mix of earning assets and funding sources and a slight decline in funding costs 
noninterest income totaled million for the fourth quarter of  up from million in the third quarter of operating expense for the fourth quarter of totaled million  down million from the third quarter of operating expense excludes merger related costs and  for the third quarter of  million of subordinated debt repurchase expenses 
there were essentially no merger related costs in the fourth or third quarters of there was a million decrease in personnel expense as a result of staff reductions associated with previously announced branch consolidations 
reductions in professional service  telephone and data processing  advertising and ore expenses and amortization of intangibles further contributed million to the decline 
the fourth quarter s operating expense level reflects realization of of the cost savings targeted with the whitney acquisition 
the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of was  compared to for the full year in the effective rate in the fourth quarter reflected the impact of certain tax credits added during the period 
the summary of quarterly financial information appearing in item of this annual report on form k provides selected comparative financial information for each of the four quarters on and critical accounting policies and significant estimates the accounting principles we follow and the methods for applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices followed by the banking industry 
the significant accounting principles and practices we follow are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these principles and practices require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate the estimates and assumptions we make on an ongoing basis to help ensure that the resulting reported amounts reflect management s best estimates and judgments given current facts and circumstances 
the following discusses certain critical accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in producing estimates that may significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes 
acquisition accounting acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
purchased assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and assumed liabilities are recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values 
management applies various valuation methodologies to these assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued 
examples of such items include loans  deposits  identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in business combinations 
management uses significant estimates and assumption to value such items  including  among others  projected cash flows  repayment rates  default rates and losses assuming default  discount rates  and realizable collateral values 
the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments also determine the amount of goodwill or bargain purchase gain recognized in connection with the business combination 
certain assumptions and estimates must be updated regularly in connection with the ongoing accounting for purchased loans 
valuation assumptions and estimates may also have to be revisited in connection with periodic assessments of possible value impairment  including impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and certain other long lived assets 
the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results  which could have material positive or negative effects on the company s results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating inherent losses  management applies judgment and assumptions to project the amount and timing of future cash flows  collateral values and other factors used to assess the borrowers ability to repay their obligations 
historical loss trends are also considered  as are economic conditions  industry trends  portfolio trends and borrower specific financial information 
although we believe we have identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support our estimation process  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in the circumstances considered when management develops its judgments and assumptions can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
accounting for retirement benefits management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts recognized and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of these plans 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of retirement benefits recognized in net income and comprehensive income 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  the cost of retirement benefits will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides further discussion on the accounting for hancock s retirement and employee benefit plans and the estimates used in determining the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit expense
