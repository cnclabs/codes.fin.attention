item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the production  development  acquisition and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas properties 
as of december   our properties were located exclusively in the transitional coastline in protected in bay environments on parish and state leases in south louisiana 
those properties spanned fields which are characterized by over years of development drilling and production history  including grand bay field which has over years of production history and over mmboe produced to date  yet remains virtually unexplored at depths greater than  feet 
our properties  the majority of which were acquired in july  cover an estimated  gross net acres with of this acreage held by production without near term lease expirations 
most of our properties offer multiple stacked reservoir objectives with substantial behind pipe potential 
we continually seek to enhance our acreage position through leasing and evaluation of opportunistic acquisitions both within the transition zone and beyond 
to that end  during the first quarter of  we bid on  and were the apparent high bidder with respect to  four leases totaling  acres in the central gulf of mexico and  subject to review of the bids and final award of the leases by the us bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement boemre  will add to our properties holdings in the gulf of mexico shelf 
as of december   our total proved reserves were mmboe  consisting of mmbbls of oil and bcf of natural gas 
the pv of our proved reserves at december  was million  based on sec pricing 
the pv of our proved reserves  based on nymex strip pricing  was million 
additionally  we had probable reserves of mmboe  consisting of mmbbls of oil and bcf of natural gas 
moreover  our reserve base includes significant undeveloped and exploratory drilling opportunities 
during  we produced  mboe  of which was oil 
as of december   our development opportunities included proved behind pipe and shut in opportunities in fields  proved undeveloped opportunities within proposed wells in fields and probable behind pipe and shut in development opportunities 
additionally  at december   we had probable undeveloped opportunities within proposed wells in fields  possible behind pipe and shut in development opportunities and possible undeveloped opportunities within proposed wells in fields 
during the year ended december   we completed development wells  of which were completed as duals  recompletions in fields and workovers in fields 
at year end  we had one additional developmental well that had finished the drilling and logging and was awaiting completion 
the well was successfully completed during the first quarter of we operated as debtors in possession under chapter of the us bankruptcy code from march  until our exit from bankruptcy on may  as a result of declaring bankruptcy and the absence of availability under our credit facilities  we operated in a liquidity constrained environment from early through march recent developments the following significant events  among others  affected our operations and financial position during  and operation in  and exit from  bankruptcy as noted above  from march  until may   we operated as debtors in possession under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
during that period  and continuing into  our operations and financial position were characterized by limited access to capital and limited flexibility in carrying out development plans and increased legal  administrative and other costs associated with operations in bankruptcy  including the incurrence of million  million and million of reorganization costs in  and  respectively 
on may   our plan of reorganization the plan became effective  our existing debt facilities were amended and we exited bankruptcy 
under the plan our revolving credit facility was amended the amended revolving credit facility as to maturity date and interest rate and claims under the facility were allowed in the amount of million including outstanding letters of credit  of which million was paid on exit from bankruptcy  our term credit facility was amended and restated the amended term credit facility as to maturity and interest rate and claims under the term credit agreement were allowed in the amount of million  mineral royalties with accrued interest and penalties owing the louisiana department of mineral resources were allowed in the amount of million the mineral royalty claims and were payable in monthly installments  amounts owing on notes payable the management notes to officers were allowed in the amount of million and were payable in full  including compound accrued interest  in months  allowed claims the other allowed claims of substantially all other secured and unsecured creditors  totaling approximately million were payable  with interest and legal fees  in full with between and of the allowed claims being paid on exit from bankruptcy and the balance being payable in quarterly installments over one year  warrants the wayzata warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock was issued to the administrative agent for the revolving and term credit facilities  and  shares of common stock were issued pro rata among the holders of other allowed claims 
during  all remaining unpaid allowed claims under the plan were paid in full  including the mineral royalty claims  the management notes and the other allowed claims and all amounts owing under the amended revolving credit facility and the amended term credit facility were repaid in full  and the facilities were terminated  in july see retirement of debt and cancellation of the wayzata warrant below 
drilling and development activities from early  and continuing following our may exit from bankruptcy  through the end of the first quarter  we pursued development activities at a curtailed pace supported by our operating cash flow and cash on hand 
with our receipt of equity funding discussed below in april and july and improved profitability we increased our capital budget in and supplemented by our increased liquidity and capital budget  we accelerated the pace of our development program beginning in april during and  we invested million and million  respectively  in our drilling and development program and infrastructure projects  up from million invested in  summarized as follows development drilling 
during and  we drilled three and two development wells  respectively 
the sl catina well  in breton sound field  was spud in july and completed in august the well logged net feet of oil pay in the  sand 
the well began production on august  and was tied back to our main pass field facilities 
the mp sl qq roux well  in main pass field  was completed in september the well reached a total depth of  md  tvd and encountered pay sands with over net feet of pay 
the well was tested and completed in the sand previously booked as probable reserves 
of the sands encountered  six were previously reflected in our reserves as proved undeveloped  one was reflected as probable undeveloped and six were not previously reflected in our reserves 
the well was tied back to our main pass facility for high pressure gas sales and to grand bay facilities for low pressure gas and liquids 
the sl qq jupiter well  in grand bay field  was spud in july and completed in august the well reached total depth of  feet md tvd and encountered feet of net pay in sands between  feet and was completed in the sand 
the well tested on august  at a gross rate of bopd and mcfpd  or net boepd  on choke with ftp of psi 
the sl north tiger well  in breton sound field  was spud in july and completed in october the well reached total depth of  feet md  feet tvd and encountered feet of net pay in sands and was completed as a dual producer 
the well tested on october  at a gross rate of bopd and  mcfpd on a choke with ftp of  psi from the  sand in the short string and bopd and mcfpd on a choke with ftp of psi from the cib carst sand in the long string  or combined net boepd 
the sl mesa verde well  in vermilion field  was spud in may and completed in october the well reached a total depth of  feet md tvd and encountered up to potentially productive intervals  including the marg a  lf  rob and amph b sands between  feet and was completed in the lf h sand 
the well tested on october  at a gross rate of bopd   mcfpd  or net boepd  on a choke with flowing tubing pressure ftp of  psi 
exploratory drilling 
during  we drilled one exploratory well  the rio grande well which was a dry hole 
recompletion and workover program 
during  we carried out recompletions and workovers 
eleven of the recompletions and all of the workovers were successful 
during  we carried out recompletions and workovers 
seven of the recompletions were successful  with two recompletions not reaching their objectives due to mechanical issues  although the reserves will stay on the books and be accessed through future development drilling 
infrastructure program 
during  we invested in million in infrastructure improvements and additions to support existing production and anticipated increases in production 
during  we invested million in infrastructure improvements and additions to support existing production and anticipated increases in production 
principal infrastructure projects during included installation of a replacement compressor at the main pass field to support higher production from wells supported by that facility through increased compression for gas lift  installation of an mile high pressure pipeline to re direct production from certain wells and commencing expansion of our breton sound facility with increased compression 
drilling and development plans 
we have an extensive inventory of drilling opportunities  including numerous proved behind pipe and proved undeveloped opportunities as well as a number of exploratory opportunities 
our near term development plans are focused on proved undeveloped opportunities and conversion of pdnp opportunities 
we presently anticipate drilling to proved undeveloped wells during and to development wells annually thereafter from an existing inventory of proved undeveloped wells 
we have also targeted between to recompletions and or workovers to be undertaken during we have already drilled and completed the mp sl qq roux toux well in the main pass field during the first quarter of and this well has been tied back to the company s grand bay facilities 
in addition to our program of proved undeveloped  pdnp  recompletion and workover opportunities  during we continued efforts to protect  and secure partners for the exploration and development of  ultra deep prospects in our grand bay and vermilion fields and  in early  bid on  and were the apparent high bidder with respect to  four leases totaling  acres in the shallow gulf of mexico shelf 
those efforts included drilling of our mesa verde well in vermilion  located in the heart of a trend presently the subject of a number of exploratory ultra deep wells presently being undertaken by larger operators 
the mesa verde well  while not an ultra deep well  identified a number of potentially productive sands and is expected to enhance the preservation of our lease position in the field 
we continue to monitor ongoing ultra deep exploratory projects and to conduct high level discussions with potential partners in an ultra deep drilling program should the existing exploratory projects prove successful 
we also intend to seek partners to develop and operate the shallow gulf of mexico shelf prospects via farm outs  promoted deals or other similar arrangements 
as of march  we had not yet entered into a joint venture  or other  agreement with respect to exploratory drilling of our ultra deep prospects or development of our shallow gulf of mexico shelf prospects 
we continually evaluate our holdings with a view to optimizing our drilling and development plans based on ongoing development efforts  new geological and operating data  identification or acquisition of new opportunities and other factors 
accordingly  our drilling and development plans are fluid and subject to continuous revision and may vary from the plans described herein 
effects of hurricane isaac hurricane isaac resulted in a disruption of production and the shut in of of our wells for a period of days beginning august and ending september  and reduced production while wells were brought back on line over the balance of the delay in returning field to productive status was primarily attributable to delays in third party pipeline transportation 
we experienced minimal damage to our asset base and estimate total gross repair cost at million  of which million is expected to be covered by insurance 
as of december   substantially all repairs arising from hurricane isaac had been completed and all of the wells had been returned to productive status 
the hurricane also caused delays in the installation of the flowlines and facility infrastructure required for the north tiger sl d well  which delayed our initial production startup by approximately days  and pushed back a number of wells in our development schedule 
leasehold and seismic activity termination of clayton williams energy farmout in grand bay field 
during  we terminated our farmout agreement with clayton williams energy covering approximately  gross acres in the northwest portion of our grand bay field 
pursuant to the termination of that farmout  we paid to clayton williams energy  and assumed full control  operation and ownership of of the working interest in the subject acreage 
seismic activities 
during  we purchased a license for d seismic covering blocks square miles in breton sound 
pursuant to the license agreement we paid an initial installment in may of  and  beginning june   made monthly installments of  for ten months ending march gulf of mexico shelf acreage 
in march  we bid on  and were the apparent high bidder relative to  four leases  with seismic maps included  totaling  acres in the central gulf of mexico lease sale the acreage is in the shallow gulf of mexico shelf in water depths of to feet 
two of the leases are in the vermilion area and two of the leases are in the ship shoal area 
final award of the leases is subject to boemre review 
lease bonuses on the prospects total  and first year annual rentals total  additionally  assuming final award of the leases  we will pay a prospect fee of  to a third party consultant 
hedges in february  the administrative agent under our credit facilities liquidated all of our existing hedge contracts and applied the proceeds thereof to amounts owed under the facilities 
as a result  our production was unhedged from february through the third quarter of during the quarter ended september   we resumed our hedging program under which  in the normal course of business  we periodically enter into commodity derivative transactions  including fixed price and ratio swaps to mitigate exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had in place fixed price swaps covering an aggregate of  to  barrels of oil per day  or an aggregate of  barrels of oil over the period beginning october and ending march  at prices ranging from to per barrel 
subsequent to december   we entered into an additional swap contracts covering to  barrels of oil per day  or an aggregate of  barrels of oil over the period beginning april and ending march  at prices ranging from to per barrel

registration rights agreements in connection with the and issuance and sale of the notes  we and the guarantors entered into separate registration rights agreements the registration rights agreements with imperial capital 
pursuant to the registration rights agreements  we and the guarantors agreed to file registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec so that holders of the notes could exchange the notes for registered notes that have substantially identical terms as the notes 
in addition  we and the guarantors agreed to exchange the guarantee related to the notes for a registered guarantee having substantially the same terms as the original guarantee 
we and the guarantors agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause a registration statement with respect to the exchange to be filed within days after the issuance of the notes and declared effective under the securities act within days after the issuance of the notes 
in the event of a failure to comply with our obligations to register the notes within the specified time periods or to continue to maintain the effectiveness of the registration a registration default  the interest rate on the notes will be increased by for each days that such registration default continues  provided that the increase in interest rate shall in no event exceed an aggregate of and provided  further  that upon cure of any such registration default the interest rate on the notes will be reduced to its original rate 
a registration statement relating to the exchange of the notes issued during was filed on september  and was declared effective by the sec on october  following the effectiveness of the registration statement  we completed the exchange of registered notes for the unregistered notes issued in a registration statement relating to the exchange of the notes issued during was filed on january  and was declared effective by the sec on february  following the effectiveness of the registration statement  we completed the exchange of registered notes for the unregistered notes in in connection with the july issuance and sale of shares  we entered into a registration rights agreement the equity registration rights agreement with the purchasers of the shares

retirement of uncontested bankruptcy claims during  we paid the balance owing with respect to the state lessor royalty audit excluding penalties with respect to which we received a waiver and notes payable to officers  being the last of the unpaid uncontested claims under our plan of reorganization 
amounts paid in settlement of uncontested claims under our plan of reorganization totaled million during critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in this report using accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements 
we must make judgments  estimates  and in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives as we apply these rules and requirements 
the most critical estimate we make is the engineering estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
this estimate affects the application of the successful efforts method of accounting  the calculation of depreciation  depletion  and amortization of oil and gas properties and the estimate of the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
it also affects the estimated lives used to determine asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are the basis for the related standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
estimated oil and gas reserves the evaluation of our oil and gas reserves is critical to management of our operations and ultimately our economic success 
decisions such as whether development of a property should proceed and what technical methods are available for development are based on an evaluation of reserves 
these oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation  evaluating impairment and estimating the life of our producing oil and gas properties in our asset retirement obligations 
our proved reserves are classified as either proved developed or proved undeveloped 
proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves include reserves expected to be recovered from new wells from undrilled proven reservoirs or from existing wells where a significant major expenditure is required for completion and production 
we also report probable reserves and possible reserves  each of which reflects a lower degree of certainty of realization than proved reserves 
independent reserve engineers prepare the estimates of our oil and gas reserves presented in this report based on guidelines promulgated under gaap and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec 
the evaluation of our reserves by the independent reserve engineers involves their rigorous examination of our technical evaluation and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines as well as other technical information and measurements 
reservoir engineers interpret these data to determine the nature of the reservoir and ultimately the quantity of proved  probable and possible oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property 
our proved reserves in this report include only quantities that we expect to recover commercially using current prices  costs  existing regulatory practices and technology 
while we are reasonably certain that the proved reserves will be produced  the timing and ultimate recovery can be effected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and changes in projections of long term oil and gas prices 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in the previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to evaluation of already available geologic  reservoir  or production data or new geologic or reservoir data obtained from wells 
revisions can also include changes associated with significant changes in development strategy  oil and gas prices  or production equipment facility capacity 
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relies on these estimates of oil and gas reserves using commodity prices and costs 
commodity prices are based on the average prices as measured on the first day of each of the last twelve calendar months 
in our year end reserve report  we used an average oil price of per bbl  and a natural gas price of per mcf which includes adjustments by property for energy content  quality  transportation fees  and regional price differentials 
while we believe that future operating costs can be reasonably estimated  future prices are difficult to estimate since the market prices are influenced by events beyond our control 
future global economic and political events will most likely result in significant fluctuations in future oil and gas prices 
revenue recognition we recognize oil and gas revenue from interests in producing wells as the oil and gas is sold 
revenue from the purchase  transportation  and sale of natural gas is recognized upon completion of the sale and when transported volumes are delivered 
we recognize revenue related to gas balancing agreements based on the sales method 
our net imbalance position at december  was immaterial 
derivative instruments we account for derivative activities by applying authoritative accounting and reporting guidance which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
substantially all of the derivative instruments that we utilize are to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production 
we have elected not to designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance and  accordingly  account for them using the mark to market accounting method 
under this method  the changes in contract values are reported currently in earnings 
oil and gas operations oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting 
oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties  plants and equipment 
leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management s judgment 
upon achievement of all conditions necessary for the classification of reserves as proved  the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties 
oil and gas exploration costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred 
exploratory well costs are capitalized  or suspended  on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found 
if economically recoverable reserves are not found  exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes 
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas  the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
for complex exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field  or while we seek government or co venture approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting 
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained  the projects are moved into the development phase  and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves 
oil and gas development costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
assets are grouped in accordance with the extractive industries oil and gas topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions and impairments 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
we record the fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long lived assets in the period in which the obligation is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location 
when the liability is initially recorded  we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related properties  plants and equipment 
over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value  and the capitalized cost in properties  plants and equipment is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized  depending upon their future economic benefit 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations  and do not have a future economic benefit  are expensed 
liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless acquired in a purchase business combination when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties  such as state reimbursement funds  are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable 
debt modification pursuant to the provisions of our plan of reorganization and under the terms of an amended and restated term credit agreement  our term credit facility was revised during to reflect the total amount borrowed and owing thereunder of million and to provide for accrual of interest at per annum payable interest only on a monthly basis with all amounts owing under the agreement being due and payable in full on april  the principal amount owing under the term note included interest expense and certain reorganization costs totaling million that were capitalized as part of the aggregate principal amount payable on the term loan 
in evaluating the accounting for the debt restructuring under the plan of reorganization  we were required to make a determination as to whether the debt restructuring should be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring tdr or as an extinguishment or modification of debt 
the relevant accounting guidance required us to determine first whether the exchanges of debt instruments should be accounted for as a tdr 
a tdr results when it is determined that a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and the creditors grant a concession  otherwise  such exchanges should be accounted for as an extinguishment or modification of debt 
the assessment of this critical accounting estimate required management to apply a significant amount of judgment in evaluating the inputs  estimates  and internally generated forecast information to conclude on the accounting for the debt restructuring 
we then evaluated if the debt restructuring constituted a material modification  in which case the debt restructuring would be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original debt and the creation of new debt  resulting in the recognition of a gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt 
if it was determined that the debt restructuring was a tdr  then there is no recognition of gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt  and the carrying amount of the debt is adjusted for any premium or discount that is amortized over the modification period 
based on analysis performed and after the consideration of the applicable accounting guidance  management concluded that the debt restructuring was deemed to be a tdr 
the debt restructuring was determined to be a tdr based on the creditors being deemed to have granted a concession since our effective borrowing rate of on the restructured debt is less than the effective borrowing rate of the old debt immediately prior to the restructuring 
accordingly  the effects of the restructuring were accounted for prospectively from the time of the restructuring  and the restructured debt has been recorded with premiums which reflect the carrying value of the old debt less the fair value of  warrants for common stock issued to the creditors 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenue oil and gas revenue for the year ended increased by to million from million in the increase in revenue was attributable to an increase in production volumes partially offset by an decline in average hydrocarbon prices realized during the following table discloses the oil and gas sales revenues  net oil and natural gas production volumes  and average sales prices for the years ended december  and revenues oil gas total oil and gas revenues production oil bbls gas mcf total production boe average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf total average sales price per boe the increase in production volumes during was attributable to increased investment in  and acceleration of  our drilling  recompletion and workover program and investments in infrastructure projects to eliminate bottlenecking and infrastructure related constraints on production 
beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through  we have substantially increased our investment in our drilling and development program  with investments totaling million in as compared to million in up from million in the gains in production volumes attributable to increased investment in our drilling and development program  and infrastructure projects  was partially offset during by the shut in of production attributable to hurricane isaac and the following transition period to ramp production up to pre hurricane levels 
the decrease in average prices realized from the sale of oil and gas reflected continued weakening of natural gas prices during much of combined with slightly weaker prices realized from crude oil sales 
our crude oil prices realized reflect a premium to prevailing wti prices as a result of the quality of our lls and hls oil production 
prior to our reinstitution of a hedging program during the third quarter of  we were fully unhedged and benefited from favorable crude oil pricing while also being exposed to declining natural gas prices 
with the institution of our hedging program late in the third quarter  approximately of our crude oil production volume during was sold under hedging arrangements 
none of our natural gas production was sold under hedging arrangements during other revenues other revenues consist principally of i a net profits interest attributable to operating the breton sound field  for which we receive a percentage of profits  ii production handling fees from our vermilion field  iii during  settlements of lawsuits against the former owners of the harvest group llc and harvest oil gas  llc and iv during  refunds of severance taxes under a louisiana incentive program relating to previously inactive wells

lease operating expense lease operating expenses for increased to million from million in  but on a per boe basis decreased to per boe from per boe in operating costs in our fields have historically been relatively high due to water handling  the need for gas lift to maintain oil production and due to the need for marine transportation in the shallow water  bay environment 
the increases in operating expenses during were primarily attributable to an increase in production volumes and an increase in operating expenses on third party operated properties and increases in transportation expenses 
the increase in lease operating expense on a per boe basis was primarily attributable to the fixed nature of certain lease operating expenses combined with the losses of production attributable to hurricane isaac 
workover expense workover expense for increased to million from million in the increase in workover expense was attributable to an increase in the number of workovers completed in exploration expense exploration expense for decreased to million from million in exploration expenses during and principally relate to delay rental payments 
loss on plugging and abandonment loss on plugging and abandonment increased to million in from million in the loss in each year reflects plugging and abandonment costs in excess of estimated costs reflected in our asset retirement obligation liabilities 
the increase in loss reflected our determination to plug orphaned wells on expired leases in little bay  south atchafalaya bay and crooked bay which we inherited from the previous owners and have never produced since we have owned the assets 
four of the wells plugged were the deepest and highest pressure wells in our inventory of wells to be plugged 
in addition several of the wells had unanticipated severe casing damage 
accordingly  the actual costs incurred in plugging and abandoning these wells was substantially higher than we estimated and would expect to incur in future plugging operations 
dry hole costs dry hole costs decreased to million in from million in the decrease in dry hole costs reflects the cost of the rio grande well which was drilled as a dry hole during depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a depreciation  depletion and amortization for increased to million from million in the increase in dd a was attributable to increased production  added capital expenditures and a reduction in natural gas reserves associated with certain properties  most notably the mesa verde well  where sands were thinner than anticipated  and little bay  where increased capital costs in our reserve report resulted in a reduction in reserves 
dd a is computed on the units of production method separately on each individual property and includes the accrual of future plugging and abandonment costs 
impairment expense impairment expense for decreased to million from million in impairment expense during related to our breton sound field and was a result of one of the three producing wells in the field becoming fully depleted during the year 
impairment expense during related to one property on which development costs and carrying value  combined  were determined to exceed fair value 
accretion expense accretion expense for decreased to million from million in accretion expense relates to our asset retirement obligations 
the decrease in accretion expense was attributable to changes in the anticipated plugging dates and discount rates used in calculating the asset retirement obligation for certain fields 
gain on revision of asset retirement obligations gain on revision of asset retirement obligations was million in as compared to million in these gains are due primarily to downward revisions in the asset retirement obligations relating to two properties which exceeded the carrying amount of the property gain on purchase price adjustment gain on purchase price adjustment was in and million in gain on purchase price adjustment arose from adjustments to the original purchase price of certain of our assets  relating to site specific trust accounts  which occurred longer than one year after the acquisition date 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for decreased to million from million in  and decreased on a per boe basis 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to reduced personnel costs and reduced legal expenses severance taxes severance taxes for increased to million from million in and increased from per boe in to per boe in the increase was primarily due to increased production and by a decrease in the number of inactive wells eligible for certain louisiana severance tax exemptions

estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices  the timing  amount  and location of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal requirements for capital are to fund our day to day operations and exploration  development and acquisition activities and to satisfy our contractual obligations  primarily for the repayment of debt 
following our exit from bankruptcy in may  we have continued to fund operations out of operating cash flow and cash on hand  which funds have been supplemented by our receipt of funds from our april and july and may equity capital raises and our december issuance of senior secured notes described herein 
from prior to our bankruptcy filing in march through the retirement of our revolving credit facility in july  we did not have access to available capital under our revolving credit agreement 
at december   and continuing as of this writing  we had not yet established a revolving credit facility and continue to evaluate multiple potential options regarding the establishment of such a facility 
we developed  and beginning in commenced  a layered  multi faceted development and maintenance program designed to achieve short  mid and long term objectives 
short term objectives are focused on restoration of shut in and curtailed production through investments in infrastructure and deferred maintenance and recompletions  workovers and thru tubing plugbacks each designed to increase or restore production volumes from wells producing below capacity and an inventory of proved developed nonproducing opportunities 
mid term  following or in conjunction with execution of short term opportunities  our focus is on the development of an inventory of proved undeveloped opportunities within our inventory of proved undeveloped wells targeting normally pressured oil and gas 
long term  following or in conjunction with the execution of our short and mid term opportunities  our focus is on continuing development of our reserves and exploratory drilling of deep shelf opportunities 
during  we achieved our principal short term objectives through substantial investments in infrastructure upgrades 
during  while continuing to advance short term objectives associated with continual investment in our infrastructure  we focused on our mid term objectives as reflected in an increase in our developmental drilling program 
as noted  we have supplemented our cash and liquidity position through a series of equity capital raises during and  consisting of the receipt of million from the sale of common stock and warrants in april  the receipt of million from the sale of common stock in july  and the receipt of million from the sale of common stock in may we have utilized the proceeds from the offerings of such stock and warrants to support accelerated investments in our development and maintenance program 
further  during july  we received million of net proceeds from the sale of our notes and  during december  we received million of net proceeds from the sale of additional notes 
funds received from the july common stock offering and offering of notes were used to repay indebtedness under our prior credit facilities 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash on hand  including funds received from our equity and note offerings  are sufficient to support our liquidity needs for the next twelve months  including funding all of our current short term objectives  including investments in planned infrastructure and deferred maintenance  recompletions  workovers and through tubing plugbacks 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash on hand will also be sufficient to pursue our current mid term objectives relating to development of proved undeveloped opportunities 
our development of proved undeveloped opportunities is scalable 
depending upon the results of our short term development initiatives  ongoing development efforts relating to our proved undeveloped opportunities and any further capital commitments  we may accelerate our planned development of proved undeveloped opportunities or otherwise adjust the nature or rate of our development program 
pursuit of our long term plans for exploratory drilling of deep shelf prospects is expected to require funding in excess of our current resources and projected operating cash flow and to be dependent upon results attained by other operators that are currently pioneering ultra deep drilling in the trend within which our ultra deep prospects are located 
at december   and as of march  we were continuing to monitor developments within the ultra deep trend and to be engaged in discussions with various potential partners relative to the potential exploration of our ultra deep prospects 
we presently lack the financial resources to carry our proportionate share of the anticipated exploration and development costs associated with such joint venture and will be required to secure additional financing to support our share of such costs and maintain our interest in such ultra deep prospects 
to that end  we expect to seek partners to enter into arrangements that will provide the necessary funding to pay some  or all  of our share of the joint venture costs with the effect of reducing our interest in the joint venture 
we presently have no commitments to provide funding to cover our share of such costs 
unexpected declines in commodity prices or production levels  or failures in achieving production increases through short and mid term development plans  could result in our inability to support our operations and drilling and development plans 
further  as noted above  in order to further supplement our liquidity and increase our operating flexibility  we intend to enter into a new revolving credit facility 
to that end  we continue to pursue efforts to secure a definitive agreement to provide a revolving credit facility but  as of this writing  have not yet established such a facility and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in establishing a revolving credit facility on terms that we consider to be favorable or at all 
cash  cash flows and working capital we had a cash balance of million and working capital of million at december  as compared to a cash balance of million and working capital of million at december  the change in cash on hand and working capital is primarily attributable to cash flows from operations supplemented by the receipt of proceeds from our placement of common stock and our december placement of additional notes and partially offset by increased investment in our development program and losses arising from lost production in the wake of hurricane isaac 
operations provided cash flow of million during as compared to million during the change in operating cash flows during was principally attributable to lost production due to the temporary shut in of our wells in the wake of hurricane isaac 
investing activities used cash flows of million during as compared to million used during the increase in cash used in investing activities during was attributable to acceleration of our development and drilling plans and investments in infrastructure projects 
financing activities provided cash flows of million during as compared to million during cash flows provided by financing activities during the reflected the receipt of funds from our equity offering million  short term notes payable issued for insurance premium finance million and our offering of additional notes million 
cash flows provided by financing activities during related to short term notes payable issued for insurance premiums million  funds received from our april and july private placements of common stock and warrants million  all partially offset by retirement of indebtedness under our prior credit facilities and payments for insurance premiums 
cash flows from financing activities during reflects the net cash received from our july placement of equity but exclude proceeds from the equity placement and note placement that were funded into escrow and applied directly to retire indebtedness 
the repayment of amounts owing under our prior credit facilities totaling million  including retirement of letter of credit obligations million  and the receipt of funds from the july equity placement and placement of notes each to the extent funded into escrow and applied to repayment of the indebtedness were reported as noncash financing activities 
debt at december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  consisting of million in face amount of senior secured notes due less million of debt discount 
we had no letters of credit outstanding at december  that were not fully collateralized by cash 
as noted  in july  we issued million of our notes and retired all obligations owing under our prior credit facilities and all outstanding letter of credit obligations 
in december  we issued an additional million of our notes 
the notes are our senior secured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the guarantors and will rank equally in right of payment with our and the guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes mature on july   and interest is payable on the notes on january and july of each year  commencing january  we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after january  at the redemption prices specified in the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we may also redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a make whole redemption price specified in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest  at any time prior to january  within each twelve month period commencing on july  and ending january   we may also redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  we may redeem up to of the notes prior to january  under certain circumstances with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings and at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
capital expenditures our capital spending for was million relating primarily to development of our oil and gas properties  including drilling development wells  recompletions  workovers and investments in multiple infrastructure projects 
capital expenditures were up from million during as of march   we anticipate that our budget for drilling  recompletion and workover projects in will be approximately as noted  we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in our cash flows from operations 
actual levels of capital expenditures in any year may vary significantly due to many factors  including the extent to which properties are acquired  drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services 
in addition to our budgeted drilling  recompletion and workover projects  at march  we were evaluating a possible tubing replacement program and a facility upgrade program in main pass each of which may entail capital expenditures on our part 
we have initially identified up to shut in wells that are potential candidates for tubing replacement with the objective of gaining barrels of oil equivalent production  or more  per day per well 
our initial estimate is that a program at that scale would cost approximately  per well 
commencement of a tubing replacement program remains subject to further analysis of shut in well candidates  further quantification of estimated costs and potential production gains and other factors 
in main pass  we have verbally agreed to the broad outline of a program to upgrade our production handling capabilities at our facilities to accommodate the handing of production from the operator of a new discovery near our facilities 
the facility upgrade  in addition to handling production from the operator  would be expected to allow us to bring production back to our facility that is currently handled at a nearby platform operated by a third party  potentially saving operating costs in the field and increasing potential production in the field due to decreases in line pressure 
the operator in question has indicated a willingness to provide an oil storage barge  separator and heater treater but negotiations remain ongoing regarding the relative contributions and rights of the parties in connection with the potential upgrade of our main pass facilities 
until negotiations regarding the main pass upgrade are finalized  we are unable to estimate the amount of capital expenditures  if any  we will be required to make on such project 
contractual obligations the following table details our long term debt and contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter debt operating leases capital leases asset retirement obligations total debt consists of amounts owing under our notes 
risk management activities commodity derivative instruments due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and requirements under our prior revolving credit agreement  historically we periodically entered into price risk management transactions eg  swaps  and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production 
in certain cases  this allowed us to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
the commodity derivative instruments applied to only a portion of our production  and provided only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices  and partially limited our potential gains from future increases in prices 
none of these instruments were used for trading purposes 
during the first quarter of  the administrative agent under our prior revolving credit agreement liquidated all of our commodity derivative instruments and applied the proceeds to indebtedness owed thereunder 
during the third quarter of  we reinstituted our hedging program 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
prices have fluctuated significantly during the last five years and such volatility is expected to continue  and the range of such price movement is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
during the quarter ended september   we resumed our hedging program under which  in the normal course of business we periodically enter into commodity derivative transactions  including fixed price and ratio swaps to mitigate exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had the following crude oil hedge contracts outstanding beginning ending fixed total net unrealized instrument date date price bbls gain loss swap january march swap january march swap january march subsequent to december   we entered into additional crude oil swap contracts for the period april to march covering to  barrels of oil per day at prices ranging from to 
we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of crude oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 
unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts that are effective are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of oil and gas hedging in the consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
for  we recorded an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
shell trading us company is the counterparty to each of our present forward physical contracts and fixed price swap contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty on our commodity derivatives positions 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
interest rate risk we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on our existing debt 
in the event that we put in place a new revolving credit facility  we anticipate that borrowings under such a facility will bear interest at a floating rate in which case we would be exposed to risk associated with such fluctuation
