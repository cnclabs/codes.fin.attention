item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is related to our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto beginning on f of this form k 
statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information before item b above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company based in philadelphia  pennsylvania and engaged in the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral and immune based chronic disorders 
our flagship products include alferon n injection and the experimental therapeutic ampligen 
alferon n injection is approved for a category of std infection  and ampligen represents an experimental rna nucleic acid being developed for globally important viral diseases and disorders of the immune system 
hemispherx platform technology includes large and small agent components for potential treatment of various severely debilitating and life threatening diseases 
we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting research and development programs 
fair value in connection with equity financings on may and   we issued warrants the warrants that are single compound derivatives containing both an embedded right to obtain stock upon exercise a call and a series of embedded rights to settle the warrants for cash upon the occurrence of certain events each  a put 
generally  the put provisions allow the warrant holders liquidity protection  the right to receive cash in certain situations where the holders would not have a means of readily selling the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants eg  where there would no longer be a significant public market for our common stock 
however because the contractual formula used to determine the cash settlement value of the embedded put requires use of certain assumptions  the cash settlement value of the embedded put can differ from the fair value of the unexercised embedded call option at the time the embedded put option is exercised 
specifically  the put rights would be triggered upon the happening of a fundamental transaction as defined below that also is an all cash transaction  a rule e transaction under the exchange act where the company would be taken private  or a transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange 
fundamental transactions include i a merger or consolidation of the company with or into another person or entity  ii a sale  lease  license  transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the company s assets  iii any purchase offer  tender offer or exchange offer in which holders of company common stock are permitted to sell  tender or exchange their shares for other securities  cash or property  which offer has been accepted by the holders of or more of the company s outstanding common stock  iv a reclassification  reorganization or recapitalization of the common stock pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities  cash or property  or v a stock purchase or other business combination with another person or entity is effected pursuant to which such other person or entity acquires more than of the outstanding shares of common stock 
pursuant to the warrants  the put rights enable the warrant holders to receive cash in the amount of the black scholes merton value obtained from the ov function on bloomberg  lp bloomberg determined as of the day of consummation of the applicable fundamental transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting a a risk free interest rate corresponding to the us treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction and the warrant expiration date  b an expected volatility equal to the greater of and the day volatility obtained from the hvt function on bloomberg as of the trading day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction  c the underlying price per share used in such calculation shall be the sum of the price per share being offered in cash  if any  plus the value of any non cash consideration  if any  being offered in such fundamental transaction and d a remaining option time equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction and the warrant expiration date 
the company recomputes the fair value of the warrants at the end of each quarterly reporting period 
such value computation includes subjective input assumptions that are consistently applied each period 
if the company were to alter its assumptions or the numbers input based on such assumptions  the resulting fair value could be materially different 
fair value at measurement dates during the period from warrants issued may   may  and may  to december   and  were estimated using the following assumptions underlying price per share exercise price per share risk free interest rate expected holding period years years years expected volatility expected dividend yield none none none the significant assumptions using the monte carlo simulation approach for valuation of the warrants are i risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rates for the warrants are based on u 
s treasury constant maturities for periods commensurate with the remaining expected holding periods of the warrants 
ii expected holding period 
the expected holding period represents the period of time that the warrants are expected to be outstanding until they are exercised 
the company utilizes the remaining contractual term of the warrants at each valuation date as the expected holding period 
iii expected volatility 
expected stock volatility is based on daily observations of the company s historical stock values for a period commensurate with the remaining expected holding period on the last day of the period for which the computation is made 
iv expected dividend yield 
expected dividend yield is based on the company s anticipated dividend payments over the remaining expected holding period 
as the company has never issued dividends  the expected dividend yield is and this assumption will be continued in future calculations unless the company changes its dividend policy 
v expected probability of a fundamental transaction 
the possibility of the occurrence of a fundamental transaction triggering a put right is extremely remote 
as discussed above  a put right would only arise if a fundamental transaction is an all cash transaction  results in the company going private  or is a transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange 
the company believes such an occurrence is highly unlikely because a 
the company only has one product that is fda approved for sale  but such product will not be available for commercial sales any sooner than the second half of  b 
the production of new alferon n injection api inventory will not commence until the capital improvement and validation phases are complete  c 
the company is expected to be required to perform additional clinical trials for fda approval of its flagship product as well as to diversify the applications of its fda approved product  d 
industry and market conditions continue to include a global market recession  adding risk to any transaction  e 
available capital for a potential buyer in a cash transaction continues to be limited  f 
the nature of a life sciences company is heavily dependent on future funding and high fixed costs  including research development  g 
the company has minimal revenue streams which are insufficient to meet the funding needs for the cost of operations or construction at their manufacturing facility  and h 
the company rights plan and executive employment agreements make it less attractive to a potential buyer 
with the above factors utilized in analysis of the likelihood of the put potential liability  the company estimated the range of probabilities related to a put right being triggered as range of probability probability low medium high the monte carlo simulation has incorporated a probability of a fundamental transaction for the life to date for these securities 
vi expected timing of announcement of a fundamental transaction 
as the company has no specific expectation of a fundamental transaction  for reasons elucidated above  the company utilized a discrete uniform probability distribution over the expected holding period to model in the potential announcement of a fundamental transaction occurring during the expected holding period 
vii expected day volatility at announcement of a fundamental transaction 
an estimate of future volatility is necessary as there is no mechanism for directly measuring future stock price movements 
daily observations of the company s historical stock values for the days immediately prior to the warrants grant dates  with a floor of  were utilized as a proxy for the future volatility 
viii expected risk free interest rate at announcement of a fundamental transaction 
the company utilized a risk free interest rate corresponding to the forward us treasury rate for the period equal to the time between the date forecast for the public announcement of a fundamental transaction and the warrant expiration date for each simulation 
ix expected time between announcement and consummation of a fundamental transaction 
the expected time between the announcement and the consummation of a fundamental transaction is based on the company s experience with the due diligence process performed by acquirers  and is estimated to be six months 
the monte carlo simulation approach incorporates this additional period to reflect the delay warrant holders would experience in receiving the proceeds of the put 
results of operations year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was higher when compared to the same period in this  increase in loss was primarily due to an increase in research and development costs in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in  an increase in production cost of goods sold in of approximately  or  an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately  or as compared to the same period in  the revaluation of the liability related to the redeemable warrants resulting in a non cash gain of approximately  in as compared to non cash gain of approximately  for the same period in  resulting in an increased loss of  sale in january of  of our new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards for the years and for approximately  as compared to february  when we effectively sold  of our new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards for the years through for approximately  representing a decrease in income of  or  offset by an increase in interest and other income of approximately  from funds invested in marketable securities

the number of patients increased in there were patients in and patients in participating in the program 
commercial sales of alferon n injection were halted in march when our finished goods inventory expired 
as a result  we had no alferon n injection product to commercially sell in or and all sales revenue in and has been generated from the ampligen cost recovery treatment program 
production cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and this increase of  or was primarily due to cost of fill  finish and packaging of alferon n injection work in process inventory along with a related valuation write down reserve of approximately  to the lower of cost or market 
research and development costs overall research and development r d costs for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to  for the same period a year ago  reflecting an increase of approximately  or 
the increased r d efforts during the year were primarily due to approximately  spent on our efforts regarding the ampligen nda and preparedness for the fda pre approval inspections of the new brunswick manufacturing facility along with approximately  of employment agreement incentive payment to dr 
william a 
carter  our chief executive officer  president and chief scientific officer  with these expenses offset by approximately  of cost savings achieved by suspending alferon related r d projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting an increase of approximately  or 
the higher g a expenses in consisted primarily of an increase of approximately  in legal fees due to the cato capital  llc litigation and efforts to domesticate the judgment against jci in south africa  approximately  of prior year s director s fees paid to dr

for detailed information on the sources of legal fees  see note contingencies under notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income interest and other income for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the primary causes for the increase of investment income was a higher rate of return from our portfolio of short and long term bond and fixed income type investments during  an increase in the size of our portfolio as proceeds were realized from sale of stock through the maxim atm in the latter part of and capital gain distributions of approximately  from the mutual funds investments 
the interest income from the investments is recognized over the life of the instrument 
interest expense in and  we financed through capital leases some office equipment vital to our overall operations as well as manufacturing equipment utilized in the production of alferon 
for the years ended december  and  we had interest expense of approximately  and  respectively from these capital leases 
sale of new jersey tax net operating loss in january  we effectively sold  of our approximately  of new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards for the years and for approximately  as compared to february  when we effectively sold  of our new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards for the years through for approximately  representing a decrease in gain of approximately  or see note income taxes fasb asc income taxes and subsequent event

results of operations year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was lower when compared to the same period in this  decrease in loss was primarily due to a decrease in research and development costs in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in  a decrease in production cost of goods sold in of approximately  or  a decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately  or as compared to the same period in  an adjustment at december  to record the change in fair value for a liability related to certain redeemable warrants originally issued in may this liability was recorded in may  adjusted and revalued to  at december   resulting in a related non cash gain of  in the value of this liability at december  was  the cumulative quarterly adjustments needed during to revalue the liability resulted in a related non cash gain of  for year ended december  this resulted in a decrease in loss of  in compared to  the receipt of funds from the sale of state new jersey tax net operating losses for years to for  which were offset by a decrease in interest and other income in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in net loss per share for the year ended was approximately versus approximately for the same period in the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  was  as compared to  as of december  revenues revenues from our ampligen cost recovery treatment program for the year ended december  were approximately  compared to revenues of  for the same period in  an increase of  or for patients in and patients in participating in the program 
commercial sales of alferon n injection were halted in march when our finished goods inventory expired 
as a result  we had no alferon n injection product to commercially sell in or and all sales revenue in and has been generated from ampligen cost recovery clinical treatment programs 
production cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and this decrease of  or was primarily due to the shrinkage of work in process due to restarting the manufacturing process and the resulting necessary additional testing of equipment  work in process and finished goods inventory for quality control 
the additional costs related to addressing manufacturing issues were approximately  and the lower cost to maintain existing alferon n injection and ampligen inventory including storage  stability testing  transport and reporting costs due to our efforts to reduce the production costs of alferon n injection for potential future commercial sales 
these savings achieved in were somewhat offset by comparison to due to last year s recognition of insurance proceeds of approximately  received for storm damages which occurred at the new brunswick  nj facility and september costs related to the transfer of existing alferon n injection and ampligen inventory to a new vendor bioridge in coordination with the sales  marketing and education effort to be undertaken by armada healthcare for alferon n injection 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to  for the same period a year ago  reflecting a decrease of  or 
in we spent approximately  for the ampligen new drug treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome  approximately  for alferon ldo for influenza and approximately  for other projects 
the primary factors for the decrease in research and development costs were a suspension of some clinical  research and development costs related to alferon ldo as we work to select a vendor to conduct a confirmatory study  which will help us to further evaluate the potential effectiveness of this product and determine the cost benefit of proceeding with the planned study of seasonal and pandemic influenza 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of  or 
the primary reason for this decrease in expense in consisted primarily of a decrease in legal fees totaling approximately  due to settlement in of various legal proceedings 
interest and other income interest and other income for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
the primary causes for the decrease of interest income in were the use of some of the proceeds from investments in operations  thereby diminishing the amounts available for investments and proportionately reducing the flow of interest income  and the receipt of capital gain distributions in of approximately  which did not re occur in interest expense and financing costs in and prior to the establishment of the margin account loan  we financed through capital leases some office equipment vital to our overall operations as well as manufacturing equipment utilized in the production of alferon 
for the year ended december  and  we had interest expense of approximately  and  respectively 
sale of new jersey tax net operating loss in february  we received approximately  from the sale of the state of new jersey tax net operating losses for years to no such sale occurred in redeemable warrants valuation adjustment the december  and revaluations resulted in non cash adjustments to the redeemable warrants liability as of december  and of approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of  liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended december   was approximately  compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  or 
excluding the proceeds from the sale of new jersey net operating loss carry forwards  cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended december   was approximately  compared to  cash used in operating activities increased by approximately  or over the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to our efforts regarding the ampligen nda and preparedness for the fda pre approval inspections of the new brunswick manufacturing facility 
in january  we effectively sold  of our new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards for the years and for approximately  as compared to february  when we effectively sold  of our new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards for the years through for approximately  as of december   we had approximately  of new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards expiring in the years through available to offset future state taxable income or possibly sell though the state of new jersey s corporate business tax transfer program 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities inclusive of  in marketable securities collateralizing certain debts  or an increase of approximately  from december  however  if we are unable to commercialize and sell ampligen or alferon ldo and or recommence material sales of alferon n injection  our operations  financial position and liquidity may be adversely impacted  and additional financing may be required  however  there is no assurance that such financing will be available 
in its crl  the fda communicated that hemispherx should conduct at least one additional clinical trial  complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analysis 
until we undertake the end of review conference s with the fda  we are unable to reasonably estimate the nature  costs  necessary efforts to obtain fda clearance or anticipated completion dates of any additional clinical study or studies 
utilizing the industry norms for undertaking a phase iii clinical study  we estimate upon acceptance of the study s design that it would take approximately months to three years to complete a new well controlled ampligen clinical study for resubmission to the fda 
it can be reasonably anticipated that the time and cost to undertake clinical trial s  studies and data analysis are beyond our current financial resources without gaining access to additional funding 
the actual duration to complete the clinical study may be different based on the length of time it takes to design the study and obtain fda s acceptance of the design  the final design of an acceptable phase iii clinical study design  availability of suitable participants and clinical sites along with other factors that could impact the implementation of the study  analysis of results or requirements of the fda and or other governmental organizations

risk factors  we may require additional financing which may not be available 
the limited number of shares of common stock available for financing without prior stockholder approval may hinder our ability to raise additional funding 
a margin account loan was established with wells fargo advisors for which the proceeds of this flexible form of indebtedness effectively serves us as a line of credit to finance the capital improvement project underway at the new brunswick  new jersey manufacturing facility 
in order to maintain this margin account  established on july   we needed to pledge  restrict from sale and segregate to a margin account our marketable securities at an approximate ratio of two to one  based on the diversity of securities pledged as collateral  for debt undertaken 
with the exception of collateral requirements  we maintain all the rights and benefits of ownership including receipt of interest  dividends or proceeds from the securities 
while this margin account has no material establishment or maintenance fees  from its inception in october through september  it carried an effective interest rate of per annum applied against the margin debit balance ie  those funds withdrawn and outstanding  based on the prevailing wells fargo base rate less 
currently  an effective interest rate of per annum is being applied against the margin debit balance by wells fargo advisors 
as of december   the principal loan balance of the margin account was approximately  for which approximately  in marketable securities were restricted as dedicated collateral for the indebtedness 
at december   the principal loan balance of the margin account was approximately  for which approximately  in marketable securities were restricted as dedicated collateral 
the finance and construction period interest charges were approximately  and  for the twelve months ended december  and three months ended december   respectively 
see note margin account loan 
on july   we entered into a new eda with maxim the new eda pursuant to which we may sell up to  worth of our shares of common stock from time to time through maxim  as sales agent 
under the new eda  maxim is entitled to a fixed commission rate of of the gross sales price of shares sold under the new eda  up to aggregate gross proceeds of  and thereafter  at a fixed commission rate of of the gross sales price of shares sold under the eda 
sales of the shares  if any  may be made in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in rule under the securities act of  as amended  including sales made by means of ordinary brokers transactions  including on the nyse mkt  at market prices or as otherwise agreed with maxim 
we have no obligation to sell any of the shares and may at any time suspend offers under the new eda or terminate the new eda 
the shares are being sold pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement on form s  declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on july  on september   we filed a prospectus supplement with the securities and exchange commission related to the offering of  shares under the atm 
on october   we filed an updated prospectus supplement 
as a result  as of the date of this report  an aggregate of  shares are allocated for public sale under the prospectus supplement pursuant to the atm 
as of december   we had sold an aggregate of approximately  shares that resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately  after direct expenses along with commissions paid to maxim of approximately  see note stockholders equity 
during the twelve months ended december   we sold no shares through this program and received no net cash proceeds 
there can be no assurances that  if needed  we will be able to raise adequate funds from these or other sources or enter into licensing  partnering or other arrangements to advance our business goals 
our inability to raise such funds or enter into such arrangements  if needed  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  acquisitions of intellectual property or assets  enhancements to the manufacturing process  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory processes including the commercializing of ampligen products or new utilization of alferon products

new accounting pronouncements refer to note i recent accounting standards and pronouncements under notes to consolidated financial statements 
disclosure about off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenue from the sale of ampligen under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is delivered  as title is then transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has been accepted by the customer 
inventories we use the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market method of accounting for inventory 
patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years 
we review our patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans 
stock based compensation under fasb asc compensation stock compensation asc share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the provisions of asc  using a modified prospective application 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton pricing option valuation model 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we use historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life  which represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding until they are exercised  and forfeiture rates 
redeemable warrants we utilize the guidance contained in asc formerly sfas in the determination of whether to record warrants and options as equity and or liability 
if the guidance of asc is deemed inconclusive  we continue our analysis utilizing asc formerly eitf 
our method of recording the related value attempts to be consistent with the standards as defined by the financial accounting standards board utilizing the concept of fair value from asc that states that any fair value measurement requires that the reporting entity to determine the valuation technique s appropriate for the measurement  considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs fall 
we recomputed the value of the redeemable warrants at the end of each quarterly period 
we use the monte carlo simulation approach which includes subjective input assumptions that are consistently applied each quarter 
if we were to alter our assumptions or the numbers input based on such assumptions  the resulting fair value could be materially different 
as discussed in greater detail in fair value at the beginning of this item  the significant assumptions using this model are i risk free interest rate  ii expected holding period  iii expected volatility  iv expected dividend yield  v expected probability of a fundamental transaction  vi expected timing of announcement of a fundamental transaction  vii expected day volatility at announcement of a fundamental transaction  viii expected risk free interest rate at announcement of a fundamental transaction  and ix expected time between announcement and consummation of a fundamental transaction 
concentration of credit risk our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks 
at and since january   we have had bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured limits 
concentration of credit risk  with respect to receivables  is limited through our credit evaluation process 
we do not require collateral on our receivables 
our receivables historically consisted principally of amounts due from wholesale drug companies 
at both december  and there were no receivables 
all sales for years ended december  and were prepaid by the customer related to the ampligen cost recovery treatment program 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities restricted and non restricted at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding needs  we intend to invest the excess cash in money market accounts or three to twelve month financial instruments 
we employ established conservative policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to investment exposure
