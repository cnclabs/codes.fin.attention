item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering  developing  manufacturing and commercializing small molecule drugs for patients with serious diseases 
over the last two years  we have obtained approval for  and initiated commercial sales of  our first two products incivek telaprevir  which we market in the united states and canada for the treatment of adults with genotype hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection  and kalydeco ivacaftor  which we market in the united states  canada and europe for the treatment of patients six years of age and older with cystic fibrosis  or cf  who have a specific genetic mutation that is referred to as the gd mutation 
we receive royalties from sales in europe and other countries of telaprevir  which is marketed as incivo  by our collaborator  janssen pharmaceutica  nv we invest in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for patients with serious diseases  with a focus on specialty markets 
our strategy is to make focused investments to invent and develop innovative drugs  while we continue to market incivek and kalydeco to eligible patients to generate revenues and maintain a strong financial position 
each of our products has achieved rapid acceptance for the treatment of patients in the united states  and our total revenues have increased from million in to billion in our total revenues included incivek net product revenues of billion and kalydeco net product revenues of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of billion 
we expect that our total net product revenues will decline in our net product revenues from sales of incivek declined over the course of  and we expect this trend to continue due to reduced demand for current therapies for hcv infection  as it appears that new competitive therapies will reach the market over the next several years 
we expect that kalydeco product revenues will increase in as compared to  as we secure reimbursement for kalydeco in additional international markets 
in the future  we expect that our ability to increase net product revenues will be dependent upon increasing kalydeco sales and introducing one or more of our late stage development products to the market 
in the near term  we plan to focus most of our drug development investment on the following key programs cystic fibrosis our goal is to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to as many patients with cf as possible and to maximize those benefits 
we are conducting three phase label expansion clinical trials and a proof of concept clinical trial of ivacaftor monotherapy in people with certain mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  or cftr  gene that were not studied in prior phase clinical trials 
in february  we initiated an international pivotal phase development program to evaluate combinations of ivacaftor and our investigational cf corrector vx for patients with the most prevalent genetic mutation that causes cf 
hcv we are investigating all oral  interferon free treatment regimens that are weeks or less in duration with a goal of providing a high viral cure rate and improved tolerability  in order to be commercially competitive in the hcv market of the future 
we plan to conduct multiple phase clinical trials to evaluate all oral combination treatment regimens that include our hcv nucleotide analogue vx together with molecules that have potentially complimentary mechanisms  such as ribavirin  or rbv  hcv protease inhibitors  hcv nsa inhibitors and non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitors 
autoimmune diseases we are evaluating our jak inhibitor  vx  in a phase clinical trial that is expected to enroll approximately patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
we may seek collaborators for some of our drug candidates in order to diversify risk  broaden or accelerate or otherwise benefit a development program in an effort to fully realize the value of a drug candidate 
we plan to continue investing in our research programs and supporting scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines 
we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide the drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years 
we have later stage research programs in the areas of cystic fibrosis  huntington disease  multiple sclerosis and cancer 
discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take to years or more 
potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to 
table of contents generate information concerning efficacy  side effects  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product 
most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development  and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval 
because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks  we closely monitor the results of our discovery research  clinical trials and nonclinical studies  and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights  with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs as well as those of our competitors 
if we believe the data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate  we submit a new drug application  or nda  to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions 
to obtain approval  we must  among other things  demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities  processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease  and could delay  limit or deny regulatory approval 
if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether  our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed 
cf kalydeco ivacaftor is approved in the united states  canada and the european union for the treatment of patients with cf six years of age and older who have the gd mutation on at least one allele of the cftr gene 
we are continuing our work in cf to identify and develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to as many patients with cf as possible and to maximize those benefits 
we have multiple ongoing clinical development programs to evaluate our cf treatment regimens  and our research group is working to identify additional corrector compounds that could be included in future dual and or triple combination treatment regimens that have the potential to provide additional benefits to patients with cf 
ivacaftor monotherapy we are conducting three phase label expansion clinical trials and a phase clinical trial of ivacaftor monotherapy we have completed enrollment in a phase clinical trial evaluating ivacaftor in patients six years of age and older with cf with gating mutations other than the gd mutation 
we are continuing enrollment in a phase clinical trial evaluating ivacaftor in patients six years of age and older with cf with the rh mutation in the cftr gene on at least one allele 
we have begun dosing patients in a phase clinical trial in which we are evaluating a pediatric formulation of ivacaftor as a treatment for children two to five years of age with gating mutations in the cftr gene  including the gd mutation 
we are enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial in which we are evaluating ivacaftor in patients with cf who have clinical evidence of residual cftr function 
if we are able to establish that these additional patient groups will benefit from ivacaftor monotherapy  there is the potential to increase the number of patients eligible for treatment with ivacaftor monotherapy to more than of patients with cf 
we expect to obtain data from the phase clinical trials evaluating patients six years of age and older in 
table of contents vx in combination with ivacaftor in february  we initiated an international pivotal phase clinical program to evaluate combinations of vx and ivacaftor in patients with cf who have two copies of the fdel mutation in their cftr gene homozygous 
we plan to conduct two week phase clinical trials that are designed to support approval of the combination of vx and ivacaftor for patients years of age and older 
each phase clinical trial will enroll approximately patients with cf who are homozygous for the fdel mutation  for a total of approximately  patients 
the two clinical trials have the same design and together will be conducted at approximately clinical trial sites in north america  europe and australia 
we expect to obtain final safety and efficacy data from both phase clinical trials in if these trials are successful  we plan to submit an nda to the fda in and a marketing authorization application  or maa  to the european medicines agency  or ema 
we also plan to conduct an week exploratory phase clinical trial of vx in combination with ivacaftor in patients with cf who are years of age and older and who have one copy of the fdel mutation in the cftr gene and a pharmacokinetics and safety clinical trial to evaluate vx in combination with ivacaftor in children with cf six to eleven years of age who have two copies of the fdel mutation 
if successful  we plan to use the data from the pharmacokinetics and safety clinical trial  along with data from the two phase clinical trials  for registration in the united states in patients six to eleven years of age  following registration in patients years of age and older  and are continuing discussions with european regulatory agencies for patients in this age group 
hcv janssen and we market incivek incivo in direct competition with merck co  inc victrelis boceprevir  another hcv protease inhibitor that was approved for sale in the united states and europe in we expect that a number of new therapies for hcv infection will become available to patients over the next several years 
the most advanced drug candidates  gilead gs and janssen tmc  may be approved for administration in combination with pegylated interferon  or peg ifn  and rbv  as soon as late or the top line results reported by gilead and janssen from recently completed phase clinical trials suggest that the safety and efficacy profiles of gs and tmc will position them  if approved  to potentially take a significant portion of the market for hcv therapies 
we plan to compete in the hcv infection market as it shifts away from current treatment regimens  including our incivek triple combination therapy  to regimens that incorporate new drugs with improved safety  efficacy and or tolerability  by pursuing development of all oral regimens incorporating one or more of our drug candidates  particularly our hcv nucleotide analogue vx a number of pharmaceutical companies are investigating combination regimens that incorporate one or more of an hcv protease inhibitor  an hcv nucleotide analogue  an hcv non nucleotide polymerase inhibitor or an nsa inhibitor 
clinical trials of these investigational combination regimens are being conducted in a wide variety of patient populations  including treatment na ve and treatment failure patients  and across all hcv genotypes  which respond differently to different combinations of molecules employing different mechanisms 
in the future  we expect that the market for any specific hcv treatment regimen  including incivek triple combination therapy  could be affected by the introduction of new competitive drugs or drug combinations  sales from currently approved drugs  adverse information regarding the safety characteristics or efficacy of the regimen  significant new information regarding potential treatment regimens being evaluated in clinical trials  and enrollment by patients in clinical trials being conducted by us or our competitors 
while it is possible that a portion of patients with hcv infection would continue to benefit from treatment regimens that include peg ifn  we expect that treatment regimens that include the administration of peg ifn by injection will command a relatively small portion of the overall market 
we are evaluating potential all oral treatment regimens in planned and ongoing phase clinical trials in order to determine which regimen or regimens appear likely to provide benefits to patients and to take forward into phase clinical development 
some of our competitors potential all oral treatment regimens are more advanced  including all oral treatment regimens that are being evaluated in phase clinical trials by gilead and abbvie  inc while the development and regulatory timelines for drug candidates for the treatment of hcv infection are subject to risk and uncertainty  and the development of a number of hcv infection drug candidates  including bristol myers squibb bms and one of our two hcv nucleotide analogues  als  ended in  we believe that i substantial additional clinical data regarding potential all oral treatment regimens will become available in and ii it is possible that one or more all oral treatment regimens for genotype hcv infection could be commercially available as soon as late as a result  if we are successful in developing all oral treatment regimens that include vx and or vx  independently or with a collaborator  it is likely 
table of contents that our all oral treatment regimens would compete directly with one or more previously approved all oral treatment regimens 
drug supply in order to generate revenues from our approved products  we must manufacture  or have manufactured  our products in accordance with our specifications and regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand 
we rely on an international network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our products and for supplies of compounds for clinical trials  and we expect that we will continue to rely on third parties to provide these manufacturing services for the foreseeable future 
third party contract manufacturers  including some in china  supply us with raw materials  and contract manufacturers in the european union and the united states convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form 
establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third party relationships 
although we believe we effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain  we do not have complete control over their activities 
we require a supply of incivek for commercial sale in the united states and canada 
we attempt to manage our incivek inventory levels based on forecasted demand  which has had variable results due to the rapidly evolving nature of the hcv market  which resulted in decreased demand for incivek 
we currently believe that we have sufficient supply to meet forecasted demand for incivek 
in addition  we have significant quantities of materials that we do not expect to utilize 
we require a supply of ivacaftor for commercial sale as kalydeco and for use in our clinical trials 
we obtain ivacaftor to meet our commercial and clinical supply needs through a third party manufacturing network 
our supply chain includes sole source suppliers 
a disruption in the commercial supply of kalydeco for patients would have a significant impact on patients  our business and our product revenues 
a disruption in the clinical supply of ivacaftor could delay the completion of clinical trials and impact timelines for filing an snda or nda 
accordingly  we are in the process of establishing secondary sources for our kalydeco supply needs to reduce the risk of a supply disruption 
in  we plan to obtain an alternative source for the active ingredient of ivacaftor  which is a sole sourced material that is critical to the supply of ivacaftor  and to obtain second source suppliers in for other components of the ivacaftor supply chain 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish secondary sources for all of our kalydeco supply needs on a timely basis or at all 
regulatory compliance our marketing of pharmaceutical products  which began in  is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations 
we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify  prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance 
among other laws  regulations and standards  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims statutes  and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved  or off label  uses 
anti kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit  offer  receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to induce  the referral of business  including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain  administer and expand these compliance programs globally 
operations over the last several years we experienced significant growth and expanded our operations globally to support the launch of our first two products and our continued investment in key development and research programs 
we are planning to move our corporate headquarters and a majority of our employees from a number of buildings in cambridge  massachusetts into a new facility in boston  massachusetts in the first half of this move is intended to allow us to consolidate our headquarters into one campus and to update our physical infrastructure  including our laboratories and other research facilities 
in order to manage the global expansion of our business and our move to these new headquarters  we will need to enhance our cross functional operational  financial and management processes while continuing to attract and maintain highly skilled employees 
we expect that managing our growing operations will be challenging and will require significant financial and management resources

we believe these decreases are the result of a combination of factors  including new safety and efficacy data that have been reported by our competitors regarding treatment regimens for hcv infection that may become commercially available over the next several years 
we began recognizing net product revenues from sales of kalydeco in the first quarter of  and kalydeco net product revenues increased on a quarterly basis during since its approval  most eligible patients in the united states have initiated and are receiving treatment with kalydeco 
kalydeco net product revenues were million in the fourth quarter of  including million of net product revenues from countries in europe 
further increases in kalydeco net product revenues in are dependent on ongoing reimbursement decisions in international markets 
we currently receive funding for kalydeco from france and germany  while we are continuing to discuss the reimbursement rate we will receive in those countries in future periods 
funding for kalydeco has been recommended in england and ireland  and we anticipate that reimbursement in these countries will begin in the second quarter of royalty revenues janssen obtained approval to market incivo in the european union in the third quarter of our royalty revenues increased by million in as compared to due to a million increase in royalty revenues from sales of incivo by janssen

we sold our rights to these hiv royalties in for a one time cash payment of million 

table of contents collaborative revenues our collaborative revenues have fluctuated significantly on an annual basis 
this variability has been due to  among other things the achievement of significant milestone revenues in  the amendment of our collaboration agreement with mitsubishi tanabe  which provided for an up front payment that was recognized over the period from the third quarter of through the second quarter of  the amendment to our collaboration agreement with the cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated  or cfft  which began providing us additional research and development support in  and variable revenues we received from services we provided to janssen and mitsubishi tanabe through our third party manufacturing network

research and development expenses comparison comparison increase increase increase increase in thousands in thousands  except percentages research expenses development expenses total research and development expenses our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates 
we do not assign our internal costs  such as salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and infrastructure costs  to individual drugs or drug candidates  because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs 
these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs  such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research  which we do allocate by individual program 
all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred 
to date  we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
in addition  the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
over the three year period ended december   costs related to our hcv and cf programs have represented the largest portion of our development costs 
any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change 
in the first quarter of  we initiated a pivotal phase clinical program to evaluate vx in combination with ivacaftor 
we expect to obtain final safety and efficacy data from two phase clinical trials in this program in if these clinical trials are successful  we plan to submit an nda to the fda in we cannot make a meaningful estimate when  if ever  our other clinical development programs will generate revenues and cash flows

provision for income taxes in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
this provision for income taxes was principally due to a provision of million attributable to noncontrolling interest alios

a summary of net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest alios in and is as follows in thousands loss income before provision for benefit from income taxes decrease increase in fair value of contingent milestone and royalty payments provision for benefit from income taxes net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest alios in and  the fair value of contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios increased by million and million  respectively 
the increases in the fair value of contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios were due to the advancement of our hcv nucleotide analogue program in and  including the positive data we received in from a phase clinical trial that evaluated als now formulated as vx 
increases in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios result in a decrease in net income attributable to vertex or an increase in net loss attributable to vertex on a dollar for dollar basis 
if vx continues to advance in clinical development  we expect to record additional increases in the fair value of these contingent milestone and royalty payments 
changes in the fair value of these contingent milestone and royalty payments and the effects of these changes on net income loss attributable to vertex were material in and and may be material in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding alios cash and cash equivalents  of billion  which was an increase of million from million as of december  this increase was due to cash receipts from product sales and royalties and million in cash we received from issuances of common stock pursuant to employee benefit plans 
these cash receipts were partially offset by cash expenditures we made related to  among other things  research and development expenses  sales  general and administrative expenses and milestone payments to alios  as well as million for capital expenditures for property and equipment 
sources of liquidity we intend to rely on cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity and cash flows from royalties as a secondary source of liquidity 
we also generate proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
other possible sources of liquidity include commercial debt  public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and or development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  software and equipment leases  strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions 
future capital requirements we are incurring substantial expenses to commercialize incivek and kalydeco  while at the same time continuing focused investment in our research and development programs 
we may require capital to repay the million in aggregate principal amount of notes that mature on october  the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  and we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on april and october of each year 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at a price equal to approximately per share  subject to adjustment  and can be called by us at any time on or after october  in addition  we have substantial lease obligations that will continue through 
table of contents we expect that cash flows from incivek incivo and kalydeco together with our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amounts of future revenues generated by incivek incivo and kalydeco  and the number  breadth  cost and prospects of our research and development programs 
financing strategy although we do not have any plans to do so in the near term  we may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities  securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing 
as part of our strategy for managing our capital structure  we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues  privately negotiated transactions and market purchases  depending on market conditions and our perceived needs at the time 
we expect to continue pursuing a general financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional transactions with respect to our outstanding debt obligations  and the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
we will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
any capital transaction related to our outstanding debt obligations may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual commitments and obligations the first part of the following table sets forth commitments and obligations that were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  certain other obligations and commitments  while not required to be included on the consolidated balance sheet  may have a material effect on our liquidity

table of contents in  we entered into various agreements for the lease of equipment and software licenses  expiring in the leases were accounted for as capital leases 
liabilities assumed under capital leases are recorded within capital lease obligations  current portion and capital lease obligations  excluding current portion on our consolidated balance sheet 
our construction financing lease obligation relates to two buildings under construction on fan pier in boston  massachusetts 
although we will lease the space in these buildings  we are deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of these buildings during the construction period and have recorded a long term liability under the caption construction financing lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
commitments set forth under research  development and drug supply costs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business that were reflected in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  additional commitments and obligations not required to be recorded on consolidated balance sheet at december  our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations include interest that will accrue on the notes after december   facility operating leases  our leases for the fan pier buildings  and contractual commitments related to our research  development and drug supply activities 
these items are not required to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
our future minimum commitments under our kendall square lease for the period commencing on january  are million for  million for and  million for and  and million from january  through the expiration of the lease in april these amounts are included in the table above as part of our facility operating leases 
rent payments for our kendall square lease will be subject to increase in may  based on changes in an inflation factor 
we are using approximately of the kendall square facility for our operations 
we have entered into two subleases for the remaining rentable square footage at the kendall square facility to offset our on going contractual lease obligations 
the future minimum committed income from the subleases is million for and million for and these amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above 
see note q  restructuring expense  to our consolidated financial statements 
fan pier leases sets forth the future minimum rental payments that we are obligated to pay after taking occupancy of approximately million square feet of office and laboratory space in two buildings under construction in boston  massachusetts less certain amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  under the caption construction financing lease obligation 
we expect to commence these rental payments in december the rental payments will extend for years from the commencement date 
commitments set forth under research  development and drug supply costs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business that were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  a commercial milestone payment we expect to pay to cfft upon achievement of certain sales levels for kalydeco is included in other for collaborative arrangements we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain development  manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of pre established developmental  regulatory and or commercial targets 
our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs 
due to the nature of these arrangements  the future potential payments related to the attainment of specified development and regulatory approval milestones over a period of several years are inherently uncertain  and accordingly  no amounts have been recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  see note b  collaborative arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to our collaboration with alios  alios is eligible to receive development milestone payments from us of up to million if vx is approved and commercialized 
the agreement provides for additional development milestone 
table of contents payments to alios if a second hcv nucleotide analogue is approved and commercialized 
as of december   alios had earned million of these milestone payments  all of which had been paid as of december  alios also is eligible to receive commercial milestone payments from us of up to million  as well as tiered royalties on net sales of approved drugs 
contingent payments under this agreement become due and payable only upon achievement of certain milestones and are not included in the contractual obligations table above 
tax related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
as of december   we have million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions  million of which are directly attributable to alios 
we have no legal obligation associated with alios potential tax liabilities 
as of december   we cannot reasonably estimate the amount we expect to pay within the next twelve months in connection with such settlements 
other funding commitments as of december   we have several ongoing clinical trials 
we make our most significant clinical trial payments to clinical research organizations  or cros 
although our contracts with cros are cancelable  at our option  with notice  we historically have not cancelled such contracts 
we have recorded accrued expenses of approximately million on our consolidated balance sheet for expenditures incurred for clinical trials as of december  we have approximately million in cancelable future commitments based on existing contracts as of december  that are not included in the contractual commitments and obligations table because of our termination rights 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to  or terminations of  existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts 
our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance payment obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not for cause employment termination under existing employment contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we monitor and analyze changes in facts and circumstances that might have a material effect on our estimates and assumptions 
changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions  including in certain circumstances future projections  that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies  each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management  are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition  consolidation of variable interest entity  intangible assets  accruals  commercial supplies and inventories  and income taxes 
our accounting policies  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  including note a  nature of business and accounting policies  included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenues  net we generate product revenues principally from sales in the united states 
we sell our products to a limited number of major wholesalers  as well as selected regional wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers  collectively our customers  who subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers 
separately  we have arrangements with numerous third party payors that provide for government mandated and privately negotiated rebates  chargebacks and discounts 
we recognize net product revenues from sales of our products upon delivery to our customers as long as there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between us and our customer  collectability is reasonably assured  and the price is fixed or determinable 
we have written contracts with our customers and delivery occurs when a customer receives our products 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of each of our customers and have determined that all of our material customers are creditworthy 
in order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable  we must be able to calculate our gross product revenues from our customers and reasonably estimate our net product revenues 
our gross product revenues are based on the fixed price for our products that we charge our customers 
we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues i trade allowances  such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and customer fees  ii estimated government and private payor rebates  chargebacks and discounts  such as medicaid reimbursements  iii reserves for expected product returns and iv estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers  including patients 
these estimates  and in particular the estimates for rebates  chargebacks and discounts and expected product returns  require us to make significant judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenues on sales of our products 
the value of the rebates  chargebacks and discounts provided to third party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third party payors 
typically  government mandated discounts in the united states and canada are significantly larger than discounts provided to other third party payors 
in order to estimate our total rebates  chargebacks and discounts  we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third party payor  which is referred to as the payor mix 
we track available information regarding changes  if any  to the payor mix for our products  to our contractual terms with third party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel 
we adjust our estimated rebates  chargebacks and discounts based on new information  including information regarding actual rebates  chargebacks and discounts for our products  as it becomes available 
claims by third party payors for rebates  chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us three to six months following the related sales  potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known 
if we increased our estimate of the percentage of patients receiving our products covered by third party payors entitled to government mandated discounts by two percentage points  our net product revenues would decrease by less than one percent for the three months ended december  our customers have the right to return unopened unprescribed packages beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending twelve months after the labeled expiration date 
as of december   returns of our products have been minimal 
based on our specialty distribution model with weekly reporting of inventory levels provided to us by our limited number of customers  prescription data from third parties  the estimated remaining shelf life of our products previously shipped and currently being shipped  and contractual agreements with our customers  which include provisions designed to limit the amount of inventory they maintain  we have estimated that our product returns will be less than one percent of cumulative sales 
we track actual returns by individual production lots and will continue to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel 
if necessary  we will adjust our estimated product returns based on new information as it becomes available 
kalydeco was approved in the european union in the third quarter of and international kalydeco net product revenues did not represent a significant portion of our total net product revenues in in  we expect that an increased percentage of our net product revenues will be due to sales of kalydeco in international markets 
we sell kalydeco in europe primarily to distributors  government run hospitals and private pharmacies that prescribe kalydeco to patients 
we recognize net product revenues from sales of kalydeco in europe upon delivery to our customers as long as there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between us and our customer  collectability is reasonably assured  and the price is fixed or determinable 

table of contents up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration agreements  including the million we received from janssen in  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur 
when the period of performance is based on the period over which research and or development is expected to occur  we are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines 
because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  these estimates regarding the period of performance have changed in the past and may change in the future 
our estimates regarding the period of performance under the janssen collaboration agreement were adjusted in  and  as a result of changes in the global development plan for telaprevir 
these adjustments were made on a prospective basis beginning in the periods in which the changes were identified and resulted in decreases in the amount of revenues we recognized on a quarterly basis from the janssen collaboration 
milestone payments at the inception of each agreement that includes contingent milestone payments payable to us  we evaluate whether the contingencies underlying each milestone event are substantive  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone event  as well as the level of successful effort and investment required 
if we do not consider a milestone event to be substantive  the revenues from the related milestone payment will be recognized over the period of performance 
where a substantive milestone event is achieved pursuant to a collaboration agreement and the corresponding payment is reasonably assured  we recognize the payment as earned 
because achievement of a substantive milestone event under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone event often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
the milestone events that we achieved under our janssen collaboration agreement in that resulted in million in revenues were considered substantive and the revenues related to each milestone event were recognized in the quarter in which the corresponding payment became reasonably assured 
royalty revenues royalty revenues for incivo are recognized based on net sales of incivo as reported to us by janssen and are recognized in the period the sales occur 
because net sales as reported by janssen include certain estimates  we could experience future adjustments to royalty revenues and the adjustments could be significant 
consolidation of variable interest entity in  we entered into an agreement with alios pursuant to which we agreed to collaborate on the research  development and commercialization of als now formulated as vx and als  two hcv nucleotide analogues discovered by alios 
in  we received data from phase clinical trials in which alios evaluated als and als based on this data  we are continuing the development of vx and have ended all development activities related to als we are responsible for all expenses related to the development and commercialization of the compounds and provide research funding to alios 
we paid alios a million up front payment  and alios is eligible to receive research and development milestone payments  commercial milestone payments and tiered royalties on net sales of any approved drugs licensed by us under the collaboration agreement 
our interests in alios are limited to those accorded to us pursuant to our collaboration agreement with alios  and we have no equity interest  or right to acquire any equity interest  in alios 
in addition to alios activities related to hcv nucleotide analogues  alios is engaged in separate programs directed at developing novel drugs 
our collaboration with alios requires us to apply accounting policies that involve significant judgments and that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
under applicable accounting guidance  as a result of the relationship established through the collaboration agreement  alios is deemed to be a variable interest entity  or vie 
because we acquired an exclusive license to certain intellectual property belonging to the vie  and based on the significance of the licensed intellectual property to alios taken as a whole  the collaboration is treated for accounting purposes as if we have acquired an interest in the entire vie 
in the alios collaboration  where a through the joint steering committee  we have the power to direct the development and commercialization of vx  which are the activities that most significantly affect the 
table of contents economic performance of alios  b we are required to fund research and development activities related to the licensed assets and c we are entitled to receive a majority of the potential revenues from sales of any drugs developed pursuant to the collaboration  we are deemed under accounting guidance to be the primary beneficiary of a vie that is a business 
as a result  we are required to consolidate alios financial statements into our financial statements 
we believe that the following effects of the consolidation on our consolidated financial statements are the most significant in each period  we record net loss income attributable to the alios noncontrolling interest 
this net loss income reflects alios net loss income for the period as adjusted for gains and losses in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by us to alios 
determining the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments payable by us to alios requires us to make significant estimates regarding the probability and potential timing of achieving each of the milestones pursuant to the agreement  future potential net sales of the hcv nucleotide analogues licensed from alios and appropriate discount and tax rates 
we base our estimate of the probability of achieving the relevant milestones on industry data for similar assets and our own experience 
the discount rates used in the valuation model represent a measure of credit risk associated with settling the liability 
significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions at each reporting period 
changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of milestone and royalty payment obligation 
we expect that the net loss income attributed to noncontrolling interest alios will continue to be affected by changes in the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments 
for example  in we received positive results from a phase clinical trial of als and the fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty payments increased by million due to increases in the likelihood of achieving milestones and obtaining regulatory approvals  together with decreases in the time period over which we are discounting potential milestone and royalty payments 
increases in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios result in a decrease in net income attributable to vertex or an increase in net loss attributable to vertex on a dollar for dollar basis 
changes in the fair value of these contingent milestone and royalty payments and the effects of these changes on net income loss attributable to vertex were material in and and may be material in future periods 
since the effective date of the collaboration agreement we have consolidated all of alios expenses and revenues into our consolidated statements of operations  eliminating all intercompany balances and transactions 
in future periods  if alios increases its headcount and or expands its activities related to its other programs  its operating expenses could increase substantially 
to the extent that alios pursues other programs  we expect that expenses of alios related to those activities would be reflected in our research and development expenses and our sales  general and administrative expenses as a result of the financial statement consolidation 
we would not be entitled to any benefits from those activities 
if we cease to have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of alios because of the expansion of alios activities related to its other programs or for any other reason cease to be alios primary beneficiary  we would deconsolidate alios 
we reflect all of alios cash and cash equivalents as restricted cash and cash equivalents alios when we consolidate alios balance sheets 
we do not have any rights to alios cash or cash equivalents  these resources are not available to fund research and development programs pursuant to the collaboration agreement and these amounts do not provide us with any additional liquidity 
as a result of payments we have made to alios under the collaboration agreement  alios had significant liquid assets as of december  alios has control over the restricted cash and cash equivalents alios  including the ability to distribute the restricted cash and cash equivalents to alios equityholders  and as a result this asset  although carried on our consolidated balance sheet  is not included in the discussion of our liquidity and should be disregarded when evaluating our financial condition 
intangible assets as of december  and  our intangible assets consisted of indefinite lived in process research and development assets of i million related to our hcv nucleotide analogue program  which includes the hcv nucleotide analogue vx and included the hcv nucleotide analogue als and ii million related to vx we collaborate with alios on research and development activities related to the hcv nucleotide program and acquired vx when we acquired virochem pharma inc  or virochem  in 
table of contents each of these research and development assets relate to drug candidates that are being developed for the treatment of hcv infection 
we maintain an indefinite lived in process research and development asset on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired 
if we complete a project  we will amortize the carrying value of the related intangible asset as part of cost of product revenues over the remaining estimated life of the asset 
if we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project  we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets such as in process research and development assets  using a variety of methods  including present value models that are based upon multiple probability weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates 
the present value models require us to make significant assumptions regarding the estimates that market participants would make in evaluating a drug candidate  including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug candidate  the timing of and the expected costs to complete in process research and development projects  future net cash flows from potential drug sales  which are based on estimates of the sales price of the drug  the number of patients that will be diagnosed and treated and our competitive position in the marketplace  and appropriate discount and tax rates 
we test our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october  and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist 
events that could result in an impairment  or trigger an interim impairment assessment  include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate  changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate or new information regarding potential sales for the drug 
in connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment  we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
the field of hcv infection treatment is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advances  and several of our competitors are conducting phase clinical trials evaluating their drug candidates for the treatment of genotype hcv infection  including clinical trials evaluating all oral treatment regimens and combination treatment regimens that include peg ifn and ribavirin 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop vx or vx if the fair value of vx and or vx becomes impaired due to i unfavorable safety or efficacy data from any ongoing or future clinical trial of our drug regimens  ii regulatory delays  iii favorable results of testing or earlier fda or foreign regulatory approval of competitors products or iv any other information that affects the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing vx or vx  we would incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
alios collaboration we recorded million of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet based on our estimate of the fair value of alios hcv nucleotide analogue program as of the transaction date and made significant estimates regarding the probability of obtaining regulatory approval of an hcv nucleotide analogue  the timing and expected costs of clinical trials and other development activities  future potential cash flows from sales of drugs and the appropriate discount and tax rates 
we determined because of the advancement of vx that there was no impairment to the alios hcv nucleotide program in the third quarter of when we ended development of als no impairment has been found with respect to these intangible assets since the effective date of the collaboration 
virochem acquisition as of december   the intangible assets acquired from virochem that were reflected on our consolidated balance sheet related to two drug candidates  vx and vx vx and vx had estimated fair values on the acquisition date and december  of million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair values ascribed to vx and vx on the acquisition date were based on the estimated fair value that would be ascribed to each of these drug candidates by a market participant that acquired both drug candidates in a single transaction 
in the third quarter of  we identified certain factors that were considered impairment indicators related to vx we determined that the fair value of vx was zero dollars  based on the advancement of vx in the third quarter of  our consideration of potentially competitive drug candidates and other factors 
this determination resulted in a million impairment charge in 
table of contents we have tested the fair value of vx on an annual basis since the acquisition date and no impairment has been identified 
as of october   we estimated the fair value that would be attributed to vx by a market participant based on probability weighted present value models involving updated assumptions and estimates regarding the status of the vx development program  the potential future cash flows from sales of vx  and an appropriate discount rate 
when we updated our assumptions  we considered among other factors  the following i we continue to evaluate vx in phase clinical trials and believe that a treatment regimen containing vx in combination with other direct acting antivirals such as vx can be developed for patients with genotype hcv infection  ii our competitors initiated several phase and phase clinical trials during the second half of that include treatment arms with non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitors in combination with other direct acting antivirals that could potentially be competitive in the market for the treatment of hcv infection and iii we believe that in the future several competitive treatment regimens will be available to treat patients with genotype hcv infection 
using these updated assumptions  we determined that as of october   a market participant would assign a fair value to vx exceeding the value reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  we determined that the value of vx was not impaired as of october  and there were no indicators of impairment as of december  accruals research and development expenses  including amounts funded through research and development collaborations  and sales  general and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred 
when third party service providers billing terms do not coincide with our period end  we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  contractual services costs  costs for drug supply  marketing expenses and infrastructure expenses incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
commercial supplies and inventories we began capitalizing the costs of our incivek inventories on january  and the costs of our kalydeco inventories on january  we capitalize inventories produced in preparation for initiating sales of a drug candidate when the related drug candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sale of the inventories 
in determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories  we evaluate  among other factors  information regarding the drug candidate safety and efficacy  the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales  including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement 
in addition  we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventories 
after we begin capitalizing inventories  we perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period  and write down any excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified 
the field of treatment of hcv infection is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advances 
in  following periodic assessments of the recoverability of our inventories  we recorded within cost of product revenues an aggregate of million in charges for excess and obsolete incivek inventories 
periodic assessments of the recoverability of capitalized costs involve significant estimates and judgments on the part of management 
the charges and corresponding inventory write downs were based on our analysis of our incivek inventory levels in relation to our commercial outlook for incivek 
as part of the analysis  we considered  among other factors  i decreases in demand for incivek during and our expectation that demand would decrease further in the future  ii the potential development by us of other drugs and combination treatments for hcv infection  including pursuant to collaboration agreements to evaluate vx in combination with drug candidates controlled by third parties  that make it unlikely that incivek will play a role in future combination therapies  iii the placement of a boxed warning on the incivek prescribing information in december  iv the potential development by our competitors of other drugs and combination treatments for hcv infection  v positive results reported in from clinical trials of drug candidates being developed by us and our competitors and vi the initiation by our competitors of additional phase and phase clinical trials evaluating drug candidates for the treatment of hcv infection 
as of december   we had million in remaining incivek inventories 
we evaluate our incivek inventories on a quarterly basis  and future changes in the outlook for commercial sales of incivek  including changes due to future developments with respect to demand for incivek or the advancement or approval of other drugs or combination treatments for hcv infection  could result in additional inventory write downs and related charges in future periods 

table of contents income taxes we maintain a valuation allowance on our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets because we have an extended history of annual losses 
our us federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately billion as of december  on a quarterly basis  we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets 
after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset as of december  because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in future periods  if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized  i the valuation allowance would be decreased  ii a portion or all of the deferred tax asset would be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and iii we would record non cash benefits in our statements of operations related to the reflection of the deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the united states government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper  and money market funds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of our investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign exchange market risk as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  swiss franc  british pound and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
the current exposures arise primarily from cash  accounts receivable  intercompany receivables  payables and inventories  and calculations of royalties receivable from net sales denominated in foreign currencies 
both positive and negative affects to our net revenues from international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite affect that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
we are considering a foreign currency management program with the objective of reducing the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues
