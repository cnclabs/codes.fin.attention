our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across a wide array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive  high quality  cost effective patient care services 
the majority of patients we serve experience significant physical and cognitive disabilities due to medical conditions  such as neurological disorders  strokes  hip fractures  head injuries  and spinal cord injuries  that are generally nondiscretionary in nature and require rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting 
our teams of highly skilled nurses and physical  occupational  and speech therapists utilize proven technology and clinical protocols with the objective of returning patients to home and work 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by physician orders while case managers monitor each patient s progress and provide documentation and oversight of patient status  achievement of goals  discharge planning  and functional outcomes 
our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leads to a higher level of care and superior outcomes 
healthsouth corporation was organized as a delaware corporation in february our principal executive offices are located at grandview parkway  birmingham  alabama  and the telephone number of our principal executive offices is in addition to the discussion here  we encourage you to read item a  risk factors  item  properties  and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which highlight additional considerations about healthsouth 

table of contents competitive strengths as the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and with our business focused primarily on those services  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on our broad platform of clinical expertise  the quality of our clinical outcomes  the application of rehabilitative technology  and the sustainability of best practices 
our strengths can also be described in the following ways people 
we believe our  employees  in particular our highly skilled clinical staff  share a steadfast commitment to providing outstanding rehabilitative care to our patients 
we also undertake significant efforts to ensure our clinical and support staff receives the education and training necessary to provide the highest quality rehabilitative care in the most cost effective manner 
quality 
our hospitals provide a broad base of clinical experience from which we have developed best practices and protocols 
we believe these clinical best practices and protocols help ensure the delivery of consistently high quality rehabilitative healthcare services across all of our hospitals 
we have developed a program called teamworks  which is a series of operations focused initiatives using identified best practices to reduce inefficiencies and improve performance across a wide spectrum of operational areas 
we believe these initiatives have enhanced  and will continue to enhance  patient employee interactions and coordination of care and communication among the patient  the patient s family  the hospital s treatment team  and payors  which  in turn  improves outcomes and patient satisfaction 
efficiency and cost effectiveness 
our size helps us provide inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services on a cost effective basis 
specifically  because of our large number of inpatient hospitals  we can utilize proven staffing models and take advantage of certain supply chain efficiencies 
in addition  we created and installed a proprietary management reporting system  which aggregates timely data from each of our key business systems into a comprehensive reporting package used by the management teams in our hospitals as well as executive management 
this system allows users to analyze data and trends and view reports across the enterprise  region  state  or local levels on an updated basis 
technology 
as a market leader in inpatient rehabilitation  we have devoted substantial effort and expertise to leveraging technology to improve patient care and operating efficiencies 
specific rehabilitative technology  such as our internally developed therapeutic device called the autoambulator  utilized in our facilities allows us to effectively treat patients with a wide variety of significant physical disabilities 
our commitment to technology also includes information technology  such as our rehabilitation specific electronic clinical information system cis and our internally developed management reporting system described above 
to date  we have installed the cis in hospitals with another installations scheduled for we expect to complete installation in our existing hospitals by the end of we believe the cis will improve patient care and safety and enhance operational efficiency 
given the increased emphasis on coordination across the patient care spectrum  we also believe the cis sets the stage for connectivity with referral sources and health information exchanges 
ultimately  we believe the cis can be a key competitive differentiator and impact patient choice 
patients and demographic trends demographic trends  such as population aging  will affect long term demand for healthcare services 
while we treat patients of all ages  most of our patients are persons and older 
we believe the demand for inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services will increase as the us population ages and life expectancies increase 
the number of medicare eligible patients is expected to grow approximately per year for the foreseeable future  creating an attractive market 
we believe these market factors align with our strengths in  and focus on  inpatient rehabilitative care 
unlike many of our competitors that may offer inpatient rehabilitation as one of many secondary services  inpatient rehabilitation is our core business 
strategy our strategy focused on the following priorities continuing to provide high quality  cost effective care to patients in our existing markets while seeking incremental efficiencies in our cost structure  achieving organic growth at our existing hospitals  
table of contents continuing to expand our services to more patients who require inpatient rehabilitative services by constructing and opportunistically acquiring new hospitals in new markets  and continuing to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet 
total discharges grew from to our same store discharges grew during compared to this growth includes the net expansion of licensed beds in our existing hospitals by beds in our quality and outcome measures  as reported through the uniform data system for medical rehabilitation the uds  remained well above the average for hospitals included in the uds database  and they did so while we continued to increase our market share throughout as discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  not only did our hospitals treat more patients and enhance outcomes  they did so in a highly cost effective manner 
we also achieved incremental efficiencies evidenced by the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues 
our growth efforts continued to yield positive results in specifically  we continued development of the following de novo hospitals location of beds expected construction start date expected operational date littleton  colorado south denver q q stuart  florida a joint venture with martin health system q q greater orlando  florida market q q middletown  delaware tbd tbd williamson county  tennessee tbd tbd newnan  georgia tbd tbd we have been awarded a certificate of need from the state authority  the award of which is under appeal 
acquired inpatient rehabilitation beds in andalusia  alabama from a subsidiary of lifepoint hospitals in order to add beds at our existing hospital in dothan  alabama  acquired the bed inpatient rehabilitation unit of christus santa rosa hospital medical center 
the operations of this unit have been relocated to and consolidated with our existing hospital in san antonio  texas  entered into a letter of intent to acquire walton rehabilitation hospital  a bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in augusta  georgia 
this transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of broke ground on a replacement hospital for healthsouth rehabilitation hospital of western massachusetts which is currently leased 
we expect to relocate operations from the currently leased hospital to the new facility in december  and began accepting patients at our newly built  bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in ocala  florida in december 
we also continued to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet in we improved our overall debt profile in august by amending our credit agreement 
in that amendment  we increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from million to million and eliminated the former million term loan million then outstanding  reduced the interest rate spread by basis points to an initial interest rate of libor plus  and extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from may to august then  in september  we completed a registered public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due at a public offering price of of the principal amount  the proceeds of which were used to 
table of contents repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and redeem of the outstanding principal amount of our existing senior notes due and our existing senior notes due as a result of these transactions and our continued strong cash flows from operations  our liquidity increased from approximately million as of december  to approximately million as of december  in addition  we repurchased  shares of our convertible perpetual preferred stock for million 
we also purchased  in conjunction with our joint venture partner  the land and building previously subject to an operating lease associated with our joint venture hospital in fayetteville  arkansas 
we believe our proven track record of producing superior clinical results for a lower average reimbursement payment than other inpatient rehabilitation providers will allow us to adjust to future governmental reimbursement initiatives 
we also believe the regulatory and reimbursement risks discussed below which we have historically faced and will likely continue to face may present us with opportunities to grow by acquiring or consolidating the operations of other inpatient rehabilitation providers in our highly fragmented industry 
we have invested considerable resources into clinical and management systems and protocols that have allowed us to consistently gain market share  realize better outcomes than our competitors and achieve these results at significantly lower costs 
additionally  we believe continued growth in our adjusted ebitda and our strong cash flows from operations will permit us to continue to invest in our core business and in growth opportunities 
our growth strategy in will again focus on organic growth and development activities 
additionally  we have been disciplined in creating a capital structure that is flexible with no significant debt maturities prior to over the past few years  we have redeemed our most expensive debt and reduced our interest expense 
our balance sheet remains strong 
our leverage ratio is within our target range  we have ample availability under our revolving credit facility  we continue to generate strong cash flows from operations  and we have flexibility with how we choose to invest our cash 
in addition to investing in our core business model and growth initiatives  we will continue to consider additional shareholder value enhancing strategies such as repurchases of our common and preferred stock  common stock dividends  and  if deemed prudent  further reductions to our long term debt  recognizing that these actions may increase our leverage ratio 
on february   our board of directors approved an increase in our existing common stock repurchase authorization from million to million 
we intend to pursue a tender offer for our common stock for up to the full amount of this authorization 
for additional discussion of our strategy  business outlook  adjusted ebitda  and common stock repurchase authorization  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and liquidity and capital resources 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals  of whom approximately  were full time employees 
we are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages  hours  benefits  and other terms and conditions relating to employment 
except for approximately employees at one inpatient rehabilitation hospital about of that hospital s workforce  none of our employees are represented by a labor union as of december  like most healthcare providers  our labor costs are rising faster than the general inflation rate 
in some markets  the lack of availability of medical personnel is a significant operating issue facing healthcare providers 
to address this challenge  we will continue to focus on maintaining the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and improving our recruiting  retention  and productivity 
the shortage of nurses and other medical personnel  including therapists  may  from time to time  require us to increase utilization of more expensive temporary personnel  which we refer to as contract labor 
competition the inpatient rehabilitation industry is highly fragmented  and we have no single  similar direct competitor 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units  many of which are within acute care hospitals  in the markets we serve 
for a list of our markets by state  see the table in item  properties 
smaller privately held companies compete with us primarily in select geographic markets in texas and the west 
in addition  there are public companies that own primarily long term acute care hospitals ltchs but own or operate a small number of inpatient rehabilitation facilities as well  one of which also manages the operations of inpatient rehabilitation facilities as part of its business model 
other providers of post acute care services may attempt to become competitors in the future 
for example  over the past few years  the number of nursing homes marketing themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services has increased even though nursing homes are not required to offer the same level of care  or be licensed  as hospitals 
the primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided  the treatment outcomes achieved  and the presence of physician owned providers 
however  the previously enacted ban on new  or expansion of existing  physician owned hospitals should limit to some degree that competitive factor going forward 
see the regulation relationships with physicians and other providers section below for further discussion 
additionally  for a discussion regarding the effects of certificate of need requirements on competition in some states  see the regulation certificates of need section below 

table of contents we rely significantly on our ability to attract  develop  and retain nurses  therapists  and other clinical personnel for our hospitals 
we compete for these professionals with other healthcare companies  hospitals  and potential clients and partners 
in addition  physicians and others have opened inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in direct competition with us  particularly in states in which a certificate of need is not required to build a hospital  which has occasionally made it more difficult and expensive to hire the necessary personnel for our hospitals in those markets 
regulatory and reimbursement challenges the healthcare industry is currently facing many well publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges 
it always has been a highly regulated industry  and the inpatient rehabilitation sector is no exception 
successful healthcare providers are those who provide high quality  cost effective care and have the ability to adjust to changes in the regulatory environment 
we believe we have the necessary capabilities scale  infrastructure  balance sheet  and management to adapt to and succeed in a highly regulated industry  and we have a proven track record of doing so 
reduced medicare reimbursement on august   president obama signed into law the budget control act of  which provided for an automatic reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers in january on january   the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which delayed this reduction until march  at which time the president must issue an executive order implementing it 
we currently estimate this automatic reduction  known as sequestration  will begin impacting net operating revenues in mid march and result in a net decrease in our net operating revenues of approximately million in additionally  concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions  further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program  or both 
we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions  if any  will ultimately be enacted into law  or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 
if enacted  such initiatives or reductions would likely be challenging for all providers  would likely have the effect of limiting medicare beneficiaries access to healthcare services  and could have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
however  we believe our efficient cost structure and substantial owned real estate coupled with the steps we have taken to reduce our debt and corresponding debt service obligations should allow us to absorb  adjust to  or mitigate any potential initiative or payment reductions more easily than most other inpatient rehabilitation providers 
in addition  we decided for the current year to replace the annual merit increase typically provided to nonmanagement employees in october of each year with a one time  merit based  year end bonus paid in the fourth quarter of we believe this action will enhance our flexibility to address and mitigate the expected impact of sequestration and potential additional medicare payment reductions in and beyond 
for further discussion of the potential adverse impacts of medicare reimbursement reductions  see item a  risk factors and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview 
changes to our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform on march   president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca into law 
on march   president obama signed into law the health care and education reconciliation act of  which amended the ppaca together  the healthcare reform laws 
most notably  the healthcare reform laws have impacted  or could in the future impact  our business by reducing annual market basket updates to providers  which are discussed in greater detail below under sources of revenue medicare reimbursement  the possible combining  or bundling  of reimbursement for a medicare beneficiary s episode of care at some point in the future  implementing a voluntary program for accountable care organizations  and creating an independent payment advisory board 
many aspects of implementation and interpretation of the healthcare reform laws are still uncertain 
given the complexity and the number of changes in these laws  we cannot predict their ultimate impact 
however  we believe the above provisions are the ones with the greatest potential impact on us 
we will continue to evaluate these laws  and  based on our track record  we believe we can adapt to these regulatory changes 
furthermore  we have engaged  and will continue to engage  actively in discussions with key legislators and regulators to attempt to ensure any healthcare laws or regulations adopted or amended promote our goal of high quality  cost effective care 
for further discussion of the potential adverse impacts of healthcare related laws and regulations  see item a  risk factors 

table of contents sources of revenues we receive payment for patient care services from the federal government primarily under the medicare program  managed care plans and private insurers  and  to a considerably lesser degree  state governments under their respective medicaid or similar programs and directly from patients 
revenues and receivables from medicare are significant to our operations 
in addition  we receive relatively small payments for non patient care activities from various sources 
the following table identifies the sources and relative mix of our revenues for the periods stated for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of healthcare services that are included in managed care and other discount plans in the table above  including private insurance companies  employers  health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos and other managed care plans 
medicare  through its medicare advantage program  offers medicare eligible individuals an opportunity to participate in a managed care plan 
the medicare advantage revenues are also included in managed care and other discount plans in the table above 
patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  and other private insurance plans  hmos  or ppos but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles  copayments  or coinsurance features of their coverage 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third party payors 
the amount of these exclusions  deductibles  copayments  and coinsurance has been increasing each year but is not material to our business or results of operations 
for additional discussion of the risks associated with our concentration of revenues from the federal government  see item a  risk factors 
medicare reimbursement medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons  and persons with end stage renal disease 
medicare  through statutes and regulations  establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare facilities and services  and  from time to time  these methodologies and rates can be modified by the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
in some instances  these modifications can have a substantial impact on existing healthcare providers 
in accordance with medicare laws and statutes  cms makes annual adjustments to medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems  including the inpatient rehabilitation facility irf prospective payment system the irf pps by what is commonly known as a market basket update 
each year  the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  an independent congressional agency that advises congress on issues affecting medicare  makes payment policy recommendations to congress for a variety of medicare payment systems including the irf pps 
congress is not obligated to adopt medpac recommendations  and  based on outcomes in previous years  there can be no assurance congress will adopt medpac s recommendations in a given year 
we cannot predict the adjustments to medicare payment rates congress or cms may make in the future 
congress  medpac  and cms will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings 
for example  the healthcare reform laws require that cms establish new quality data reporting for irfs 
effective october   all irfs are required to submit data on urinary catheter related infections and pressure ulcers for the irf quality reporting program 
beginning october   and each subsequent fiscal year thereafter  failure to submit the required quality data will result in a two percentage point reduction to the applicable facility s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges occurring during that fiscal year 
our hospitals began submitting quality data to cms in october additionally  
table of contents the budget control act of  as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of on january   and its sequestration provision will result in a reduction of in medicare payment rates for all healthcare providers upon executive order of the president in march unless congress and the president take further action 
any downward adjustment to rates  or another pricing roll back  for the types of facilities we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
cms has adopted final rules that require healthcare providers to update and supplement diagnosis and procedure codes to the international classification of diseases th edition icd  effective october  we are currently modifying our systems to accommodate the adoption of icd we expect to be in compliance on a timely basis 
although this adoption process will result in system conversion expenses and may result in some disruptions to the billing process and delays in the receipt of some payments  we do not believe there will be a material impact on our business 
we will continue to monitor this implementation carefully 
a basic summary of current medicare reimbursement in our primary service areas follows inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
as discussed above  our hospitals receive fixed payment reimbursement amounts per discharge under irf pps based on certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by the united states department of health and human services hhs 
in order to qualify for reimbursement under irf pps  our hospitals must comply with various medicare rules and regulations including documentation and coverage requirements  or specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement 
these requirements relate to  among other things  preadmission screening  post admission evaluations  and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care 
with irf pps  our hospitals retain the difference  if any  between the fixed payment from medicare and their operating costs 
thus  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  cost effective providers 
under irf pps  cms is required to adjust the payment rates based on a market basket index  known as the rehabilitation  psychiatric  and long term care hospital market basket 
the market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of a mix of goods and services provided by rehabilitation hospitals and hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units 
the market basket uses data furnished by the bureau of labor statistics for price proxy purposes  primarily in three categories producer price indexes  consumer price indexes  and employment cost indexes 
over the last several years  changes in regulations governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created challenges for inpatient rehabilitation providers 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on  and in some cases  reductions in  the levels of payments to healthcare providers 
for example  on may   cms issued a final rule  known as the rule  stipulating that to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital under the medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions 
under the rule  any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed to meet its requirements would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital  with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services 
on december   the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of the medicare act was signed  setting the compliance threshold at instead of and allowing hospitals to continue using a patient s secondary medical conditions  or comorbidities  to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under the rule 
the long term impact of the freeze at the compliance threshold is positive because it allowed patient volumes to stabilize 
in another example  the medicare act included an elimination of the irf pps market basket adjustment for the period from april  through september  causing a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for medicare reimbursement to a pricing level that existed in the third quarter of  or a medicare pricing roll back  which resulted in a decrease in actual reimbursement dollars per discharge despite increases in costs 
on july   cms released its notice of final rulemaking for the fiscal year irf pps 
this rule was effective for medicare discharges between october  and september  the pricing changes in this rule included a market basket update that was reduced to under the requirements of the healthcare reform laws discussed above  as well as other pricing changes that impacted our hospital by hospital base rate for medicare reimbursement 
the healthcare reform laws also require the market basket update to be reduced by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis 
the productivity adjustments equal the trailing year average of changes in annual economy wide private nonfarm business multi factor productivity 
the productivity adjustment effective october  decreased the market basket update by 
on july   cms released its notice of final rulemaking for the fiscal year irf pps the rule 
this rule is effective for medicare discharges between october  and september  the pricing changes in this rule include a market basket update that has been reduced by to under the requirements of the healthcare reform laws  as well as other pricing changes that impact our hospital by hospital base rate for medicare reimbursement 
the productivity adjustment effective october  is a decrease to the market basket update of 
based on our analysis which utilizes  among other things  the acuity of our patients over the month period prior to the rule s release 
table of contents and incorporates other adjustments included in the rule  we believe our medicare payment rates will see a net increase of approximately beginning october  as discussed above  the effect of sequestration is to reduce that medicare payment rate by beginning in march although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business  our operations are also affected by coverage rules and determinations 
medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local level  that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable and necessary 
current cms coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a qualified rehabilitation physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team 
the interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care 
qualified personnel must provide required rehabilitation nursing  physical therapy  occupational therapy  speech language pathology  social services  psychological services  and prosthetic and orthotic services 
cms has been examining the use of group therapies in many post acute settings 
for individual claims  medicare contractors make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity which can represent more restrictive interpretations of the cms coverage rules 
we cannot predict how future cms coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us 
pursuant to legislative directives and authorizations from congress  cms developed and instituted various medicare audit programs under which cms contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits 
these audits are in addition to those conducted by existing medicare contractors 
some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered 
one type of audit contractor  the recovery audit contractors racs  began post payment audit processes in late for providers in general 
the racs receive claims data directly from medicare contractors on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review claims up to three years from the date a claim was paid  beginning with claims filed on or after october  these rac audits have initially focused on coding errors 
cms is currently expanding the program to medical necessity reviews for inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
the healthcare reform laws extended the rac program to medicare  parts c and d  and medicaid 
on august   cms launched its three year demonstration project that expands the rac program to include prepayment review of medicare fee for service claims 
currently  only acute care hospitals are subject to this review project  but cms could expand it to post acute providers 
this demonstration project will identify specific diagnosis codes for review  and the rac contractors will review the selected claims to determine if they are proper before payment has been made to the provider 
the project covers states  including states in which we operate florida  california  texas  louisiana  illinois  pennsylvania  ohio  and missouri 
providers with claims identified for rac prepayment reviews will have days to respond to requests for additional documentation 
if they do not respond timely  the claim will be denied 
providers will receive determinations within days of submitting the relevant documentation 
cms has also established contractors known as the zone program integrity contractors zpics 
these contractors are successors to the program safeguard contractors and conduct audits with a focus on potential fraud and abuse issues 
like the racs  the zpics conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the united states department of health and human services office of inspector general the hhs oig or the united states department of justice 
unlike racs  however  zpics do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the error 
as a matter of course  we undertake significant efforts through training and education to ensure compliance with coding and medical necessity coverage rules 
despite our belief that our coding and assessment of patients is accurate  audits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by medicare or submitted improper claims in some instances  require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims  and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid 
we cannot predict when or how these programs will affect us 
outpatient services 
our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed under medicare s physician fee schedule 
by statute  the physician fee schedule is subject to annual automatic adjustment by a sustainable growth rate formula that has resulted in reductions in reimbursement rates every year since however  in each instance  congress has acted to suspend or postpone the effectiveness of these automatic reimbursement reductions 
for example  under the cms final notice of rulemaking for the physician fee schedule for calendar year  released on november   a statutory reduction of would have been implemented 
however  the american taxpayer relief act of provided for an extension of the current medicare physician fee schedule payment rates from january  through december   further postponing the statutory reduction 
if congress does not again extend relief as it has done since or permanently modify the sustainable growth rate formula by january   payment levels for outpatient services under the physician fee schedule will be reduced at that point by more than 
we currently estimate that a reduction of that size  before taking into account our efforts to mitigate these changes  which would likely include closure of additional outpatient satellite clinics  would result 
table of contents in a net decrease in our net operating revenues of approximately million annually 
however  we cannot predict what action  if any  congress will take on the physician fee schedule and other reimbursement matters affecting our outpatient services or what future rule changes cms will implement 
medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford healthcare 
as the medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of cms in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines  there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state 
many states have experienced shortfalls in their medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in medicaid reimbursement rates 
additionally  certain states control medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of certain services 
continuing downward pressure on medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our net operating revenues 
however  for the year ended december   medicaid payments represented only of our consolidated net operating revenues 
although the healthcare reform laws contain provisions intended to expand medicaid coverage  part of which were invalidated by the us supreme court  we do not believe the expanded coverage will have a material impact on our consolidated net operating revenues given our current patient mix 
managed care and other discount plans all of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of healthcare services  including medicare advantage  managed care plans  private insurance companies  and third party administrators 
managed care contracts typically have terms of between one and three years  although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year with pre defined rate increases unless a party elects to terminate the contract 
while some of our contracts provide for annual rate increases of two to four percent and our average rate increase in was  we cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases 
our managed care staff focuses on establishing and re negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided 
cost reports because of our participation in medicare  medicaid  and certain blue cross and blue shield plans  we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue  costs  and expenses associated with the services provided by our inpatient hospitals to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
these annual cost reports are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs 
these audits are used for determining if any under or over payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years 
medicare also makes retroactive adjustments to payments for certain low income patients after comparing subsequently published statistical data from cms to the cost report data 
we cannot predict what retroactive adjustments  if any  will be made  but we do not anticipate such adjustments would have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
regulation the healthcare industry in general is subject to significant federal  state  and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided  requiring licensure or certification of our hospitals  regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources  regulating the use of our properties  and controlling our growth 
our facilities provide the medical  nursing  therapy  and ancillary services required to comply with local  state  and federal regulations  as well as  for most facilities  accreditation standards of the joint commission formerly known as the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and  for some facilities  the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities 
we maintain a comprehensive compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
the program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations 
as part of the compliance program  we provide annual compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor  or a toll free telephone hotline 

table of contents licensure and certification healthcare facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal  state  and local regulations relating to  among other things  the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances  infection control  maintenance of adequate records and patient privacy  fire prevention  and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws 
our hospitals are subject to periodic inspection and other reviews by governmental and non governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure 
all of our inpatient hospitals are currently required to be licensed 
in addition  hospitals must be certified by cms to participate in the medicare program and generally must be certified by medicaid state agencies to participate in medicaid programs 
once certified by medicare  hospitals undergo periodic on site surveys and revalidations in order to maintain their certification 
all of our inpatient hospitals participate in the medicare program 
failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals ineligible for medicare or medicaid reimbursement 
in addition  medicare or medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant facilities or otherwise impose sanctions on noncompliant facilities 
non governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if a facility loses its medicare or medicaid certification 
the healthcare reform laws added new screening requirements and associated fees for all medicare providers 
the screening must include a licensure check and may include other procedures such as fingerprinting  criminal background checks  unscheduled and unannounced site visits  database checks  and other screening procedures prescribed by cms 
we have developed operational systems to oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements of the medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities  however  given the complex nature of governmental healthcare regulations  there can be no assurance medicare  medicaid  or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance 
a determination by a regulatory authority that a facility is not in compliance with applicable requirements could also lead to the assessment of fines or other penalties  loss of licensure  and the imposition of requirements that an offending facility takes corrective action 
certificates of need in some states and us territories where we operate  the construction or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  or the introduction of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory bodies under a certificate of need or con law 
as of december   approximately of our licensed beds are located in states or us territories that have con laws 
con laws often require a reviewing agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services 
these laws generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds 
in addition  con laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity care commitments as a condition for approving a certificate of need 
any time a con is required  we must obtain it before acquiring  opening  reclassifying  or expanding a healthcare facility or starting a new healthcare program 
we potentially face opposition any time we initiate a certificate of need project or seek to acquire an existing facility or con 
this opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed con project 
opposition to our applications may delay or prevent our future addition of beds or hospitals in given markets or increase our costs in seeking those additions 
the necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition  including in markets where we hold a con and a competitor is seeking an approval 
we have generally been successful in obtaining cons or similar approvals when required  although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future and the likelihood of success varies by state 
false claims the federal false claims act prohibits the knowing presentation of a false claim to the united states government and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to  per claim 
in addition  the false claims act allows private persons  known as relators  to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints 
because we perform thousands of similar procedures a year for which we are reimbursed by medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations  a billing error or cost reporting error could result in 
table of contents significant civil or criminal penalties under the false claims act 
many states have also adopted similar laws relating to state government payments for healthcare services 
the healthcare reform laws amended the federal false claims act to expand the definition of false claim  to make it easier for the government to initiate and conduct investigations  to enhance the monetary reward to relators where prosecutions are ultimately successful  and to extend the statute of limitations on claims by the government 
for additional discussion  see item a  risk factors  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
relationships with physicians and other providers anti kickback law 
various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of healthcare services  including management or service contracts and investment relationships 
among the most important of these restrictions is a federal law prohibiting the offer  payment  solicitation  or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the medicare or medicaid programs the anti kickback law 
the healthcare reform laws amended the federal anti kickback law to provide that proving violations of this law does not require proving actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation 
another amendment made it clear that anti kickback law violations can be the basis for claims under the false claims act 
these changes and those described above related to the false claims act  when combined with other recent federal initiatives  are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally 
in addition to standard federal criminal and civil sanctions  including imprisonment and penalties of up to  for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims  violators of the anti kickback law may be subject to exclusion from the medicare and or medicaid programs 
in  the hhs oig issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the anti kickback law 
those regulations provide for certain safe harbors for identified types of compensation arrangements that  if fully complied with  assure participants in the particular arrangement that the hhs oig will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the anti kickback law or as the basis for an exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions 
failure to fall within a safe harbor does not constitute a violation of the anti kickback law  but the hhs oig has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny 
a violation of the anti kickback law by us or one or more of our partnerships could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation 
some of our rehabilitation hospitals are owned through joint ventures with institutional healthcare providers that may be in a position to make or influence referrals to our hospitals 
in addition  we have a number of relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers  including management or service contracts 
some of these investment relationships and contractual relationships may not meet all of the regulatory requirements to fall within the protection offered by a relevant safe harbor 
despite our compliance and monitoring efforts  there can be no assurance violations of the anti kickback law will not be asserted in the future  nor can there be any assurance that our defense against any such assertion would be successful 
for example  we have entered into agreements to manage our hospitals that are owned by partnerships 
most of these agreements incorporate a percentage based management fee 
although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts  this safe harbor requires  among other things  the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance 
because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues  the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement 
however  we believe our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and comply with the anti kickback law 
physician self referral law 
the federal law commonly known as the stark law and cms regulations promulgated under the stark law prohibit physicians from making referrals for designated health services including inpatient and outpatient hospital services  physical therapy  occupational therapy  or radiology services  to an entity in which the physician or an immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship  subject to certain exceptions 
the stark law also prohibits those entities from filing claims or billing for those referred services 
violators of the stark law and regulations may be subject to recoupments  civil monetary sanctions up to  for each violation and assessments up to three times the amount claimed for each prohibited service and exclusion from any federal  state  or other governmental healthcare programs 
the statute also provides a penalty of up to  for a circumvention scheme 
there are statutory exceptions to the stark law for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers  including personal services contracts and leases 
however  in order to be afforded protection by a stark law exception  the financial arrangement must comply with every requirement of the applicable exception 
under the healthcare reform laws  the exception to the stark law that currently permits physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an investment or ownership interest has been dramatically limited by providing that only physician owned hospitals with a provider agreement in place on december  are exempt from the general ban on self referral 
existing physician owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the physician ownership percentage in the hospital after march  additionally  physician owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed 
table of contents beds after march   except when certain market and regulatory approval conditions are met 
currently  we have no hospitals that would be considered physician owned under this law 
cms has issued several phases of final regulations implementing the stark law 
while these regulations help clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the stark law  it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes 
recent changes to the regulations implementing the stark law further restrict the types of arrangements that facilities and physicians may enter  including additional restrictions on certain leases  percentage compensation arrangements  and agreements under which a hospital purchases services under arrangements 
we may be required to restructure or unwind some of our arrangements because of these changes 
because many of these laws and their implementing regulations are relatively new  we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
we attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the stark law  but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex 
accordingly  we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the stark law 
additionally  no assurances can be given that any agency charged with enforcement of the stark law and regulations might not assert a violation under the stark law  nor can there be any assurance that our defense against any such assertion would be successful or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships  or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships  might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us or on particular healthsouth hospitals 
even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act of  commonly known as hipaa  broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs 
hipaa also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by medicare beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services 
in addition  hipaa created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including the medicare integrity program  and an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to  for providing information on medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least of medicare funds 
penalties for violations of hipaa include civil and criminal monetary penalties 
hipaa and related hhs regulations contain certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
hipaa regulations also regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information  whether communicated electronically  on paper  or orally 
the regulations provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed and require healthcare providers to implement administrative  physical  and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically 
with the enactment of the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the privacy and security requirements of hipaa have been modified and expanded 
the hitech act applies certain of the hipaa privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities 
the modifications to existing hipaa requirements include expanded accounting requirements for electronic health records  tighter restrictions on marketing and fundraising  and heightened penalties and enforcement associated with noncompliance 
significantly  the hitech act also establishes new mandatory federal requirements for notification of breaches of security involving protected health information 
hhs is responsible for enforcing the requirement that covered entities notify any individual whose protected health information has been improperly acquired  accessed  used  or disclosed 
in certain cases  notice of a breach is required to be made to hhs and media outlets 
the heightened penalties for noncompliance range from to  for single incidents to  to  for multiple identical violations 
in the event of violations due to willful neglect that are not corrected within days  penalties are not subject to a statutory maximum 
willful neglect includes the failure to conduct a security risk assessment or adequately implement hipaa compliance policies 
on january   hhs office for civil rights issued a final rule  with a compliance date of september   to implement the hitech act and make other modifications to the hipaa and hitech regulations 
this rule expanded the potential liability for a breach involving protected health information to cover some instances where a subcontractor is responsible for the breaches and that individual or entity was acting within the scope of delegated authority under the related contract or engagement 
the final rule generally defines breach to mean the acquisition  access  use or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted by the hipaa privacy standards  which compromises the security or privacy of protected health information 
under the final rule  improper acquisition  access  use  or disclosure is presumed to be a 
table of contents reportable breach  unless the potentially breaching party can demonstrate a low probability that protected health information has been compromised 
on the whole  it appears the changes to the breach reporting rules could increase breach reporting in the healthcare industry 
in addition  there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns 
facilities will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa 
these laws vary and could impose additional penalties 
any actual or perceived violation of privacy related laws and regulations  including hipaa and the hitech act  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

item a 
risk factors our business  operations  and financial position are subject to various risks 
some of these risks are described below  and you should take such risks into account in evaluating healthsouth or any investment decision involving healthsouth 
this section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us  our industry  or our business  and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors 
more detailed information concerning other risk factors as well as those described below is contained in other sections of this annual report 
reductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third party payors and other legislative and regulatory changes affecting our industry could adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our net operating revenues from the medicare program 
see item  business  sources of revenues  for a table identifying the sources and relative payor mix of our revenues 
historically  congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in regulations governing the healthcare system 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on the increases in and  in some cases  significant roll backs or reductions in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs 
there can be no assurance that future governmental initiatives will not result in pricing roll backs or freezes or reimbursement reductions 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of  which amended the ppaca together  the healthcare reform laws 
many provisions within the healthcare reform laws have impacted or could in the future impact our business  including reducing annual market basket updates to providers  which include annual productivity adjustment reductions  the possible combining  or bundling  of reimbursement for a medicare beneficiary s episode of care at some point in the future  implementing a voluntary program for accountable care organizations acos  and creating an independent payment advisory board 
most notably for us  these laws include a reduction in annual market basket updates to hospitals 
in accordance with medicare laws and statutes  the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services cms makes annual adjustments to medicare reimbursement rates by what is commonly known as a market basket update 
the reductions in our annual market basket updates continue through for each cms fiscal year  which for us begins october  as follows in addition  the healthcare reform laws require the market basket update to be reduced by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis 
the productivity adjustments equal the trailing year average of changes in annual economy wide private nonfarm business multi factor productivity 
the productivity adjustment effective from october  to 
table of contents september  is a decrease to the market basket update of 
we estimate the adjustment effective october  will be a decrease to the market basket update of approximately  but we cannot predict it with certainty 
the healthcare reform laws also directed the united states department of health and human services hhs to examine the feasibility of bundling  including conducting a voluntary  multi year bundling pilot program to test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies 
on january   cms announced the selection of participants in the initial phase of limited scope  voluntary bundling pilot projects 
there will be four project types acute care only  acute post acute  post acute only  and acute and physician services 
in the initial phase  pilot participants along with their provider partners will exchange data with cms on care patterns and engage in shared learning in how to improve care 
the next phase  scheduled to begin in july  will require participants in that phase  pending contract finalization and completion of the standard cms program integrity reviews  to take on financial risk for episodes of care 
per the announcement  cms selected as participants a small number of acute care hospitals with which we have relationships 
therefore  we expect to be part of the related bundling projects as a post acute rehabilitation provider 
we will continue to evaluate on a case by case basis the appropriateness of bundling opportunities for our hospitals and patients 
similarly  the healthcare reform laws required cms to start a voluntary program by january  for acos  in which hospitals  physicians and other care providers develop entities to pursue the delivery of coordinated healthcare on a more efficient  patient centered basis 
conceptually  acos will receive a portion of any savings generated above a certain threshold from care coordination as long as benchmarks for the quality of care are maintained 
in october  cms issued the final rules establishing the voluntary aco program 
these rules are extremely complex and remain subject to further refinement by cms 
as with bundling  we are currently evaluating on a case by case basis appropriate participation opportunities in the aco pilots for our hospitals and patients 
we have expressed interest in participating in several acos but  to date  have not entered into any participation agreements 
another provision of these laws establishes an independent payment advisory board that is charged with presenting proposals  beginning in  to congress to reduce medicare expenditures upon the occurrence of medicare expenditures exceeding a certain level 
however  due to the market basket reductions that are also part of these laws as discussed above  certain healthcare providers  including healthsouth  will not be subject to payment reduction proposals developed by this board and presented to congress through while we may not be subject to payment reduction proposals by this board for a period of time  based on the scope of this board s directive to reduce medicare expenditures and the significance of medicare as a payor to us  other decisions made by this board may adversely impact our results of operations 
given the complexity and the number of changes in these laws  we cannot predict their ultimate impact 
however  we believe the above provisions are the issues with the greatest potential impact on us 
the healthcare reform laws include other provisions that could adversely affect us as well 
they include the expansion of the federal anti kickback law and the false claims act that  when combined with other recent federal initiatives  are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally 
changes include increased resources for enforcement  lowered burden of proof for the government in healthcare fraud matters  expanded definition of claims under the false claims act  enhanced penalties  and increased rewards for relators in successful prosecutions 
cms may also suspend payment for claims prospectively if  in its opinion  credible allegations of fraud exist 
the initial suspension period may be up to days 
however  the payment suspension period can be extended almost indefinitely if the matter is under investigation by the hhs office of inspector general or the united states department of justice the doj 
any such suspension would adversely impact our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
further  under the healthcare reform laws  cms established new quality data reporting  effective october   for all inpatient rehabilitation facilities irfs 
beginning october   and each subsequent fiscal year thereafter  failure to submit the required quality data will result in a two percentage point reduction to the applicable facility s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges occurring during that fiscal year 
our hospitals began submitting quality data to cms in october for additional discussion of general healthcare regulation  see item  business  regulatory and reimbursement challenges and regulation 
some states in which we operate have also undertaken  or are considering  healthcare reform initiatives that address similar issues 
while many of the stated goals of the federal and state reform initiatives are consistent with our own goal to provide care that is high quality and cost effective  legislation and regulatory proposals may lower reimbursements  increase the cost of compliance  and otherwise adversely affect our business 
we cannot predict what healthcare initiatives  if any  will be enacted  implemented or amended  or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us 
on august   president obama signed into law the budget control act of  which provided for an automatic reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers in january on january   the 
table of contents president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which delayed this reduction until march  at which time the president must issue an executive order implementing it 
we currently estimate this automatic reduction  known as sequestration  will begin impacting net operating revenues in mid march and result in a net decrease in our net operating revenues of approximately million in additionally  concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels  including the statutory cap on the ability to issue debt referred to as the debt ceiling  could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions  further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program  or both 
we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions  if any  will ultimately be enacted into law  or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 
if enacted  such initiatives or reductions would likely be challenging for all providers  would likely have the effect of limiting medicare beneficiaries access to healthcare services  and could have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
if we are not able to maintain increased case volumes or reduce operating costs to offset any future pricing roll back  reduction  freeze  or increased costs associated with new regulatory compliance obligations  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our results could be further adversely affected by other changes in laws or regulations governing the medicare program  as well as possible changes to or expansion of the audit processes conducted by medicare contractors or medicare recovery audit contractors 
for additional discussion of healthcare reform and other factors affecting reimbursement for our services  see item  business  regulatory and reimbursement challenges and sources of revenues medicare reimbursement 
in addition  there are increasing pressures  including as a result of the healthcare reform laws  from many third party payors to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
our relationships with managed care and nongovernmental third party payors  such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  are generally governed by negotiated agreements 
these agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third party payors 
our third party payors may also  from time to time  request audits of the amounts paid  or to be paid  to us 
we could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if the auditing payor alleges that substantial overpayments were made to us due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations 
competition for staffing  shortages of qualified personnel  union activity or other factors may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our medical personnel  such as physical therapists  occupational therapists  speech pathologists  nurses  and other healthcare professionals 
we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals 
in some markets  the lack of availability of medical personnel is a significant operating issue facing all healthcare providers 
this shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel or to contract for more expensive temporary personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
if our labor costs increase  we may not experience reimbursement rate increases to offset these additional costs 
because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed  prospective payments  our ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited 
in particular  if labor costs rise at an annual rate greater than our net annual market basket update from medicare  our results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected 
conversely  decreases in reimbursement revenues  such as with sequestration  may limit our ability to increase compensation or benefits to the extent necessary to retain key employees  in turn increasing our turnover and associated costs 
union activity is another factor that may contribute to increased labor costs 
our failure to recruit and retain qualified medical personnel  or to control our labor costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 

table of contents compliance with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to healthcare providers requires substantial time  effort and expense  and if we fail to comply with them  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local government levels 
these laws and regulations relate to  among other things licensure  certification  and accreditation  policies  either at the national or local level  delineating what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement under medicare also referred to as coverage requirements  coding and billing for services  requirements of the compliance threshold under the medicare act  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  including physician self referral and anti kickback laws  quality of medical care  use and maintenance of medical supplies and equipment  maintenance and security of patient information and medical records  acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances  and disposal of medical and hazardous waste 
in the future  changes in these laws or regulations or the manner in which they are enforced could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our hospitals  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs  operating procedures  and contractual arrangements 
for additional discussion of certain important healthcare laws and regulations  see item  business  sources of revenue medicare reimbursement and regulation 
although we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial time  effort  and expense in implementing and maintaining internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties  including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our hospitals  and exclusion or suspension of one or more of our hospitals from participation in the medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state healthcare programs  which  if lengthy in duration and material to us  could potentially trigger a default under our credit agreement 
because medicare comprises a significant portion of our net operating revenues  it is important for us to remain compliant with the laws and regulations governing the medicare program and related matters including anti kickback and anti fraud requirements 
as discussed above in connection with the healthcare reform laws  the federal government has in the last couple of years made fighting healthcare fraud one of the top law enforcement priorities 
in the past few years  the doj and hhs as well as federal lawmakers have significantly increased efforts to combat healthcare fraud 
in recent years  the doj has pursued and recovered a record amount of taxpayer dollars lost to healthcare fraud 
substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
even the assertion of a violation  depending on its nature  could have a material adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation 
our hospitals face national  regional  and local competition for patients from other healthcare providers 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
although we are the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated and discharged  revenues  and number of hospitals  in any particular market we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance this competition  or other competition which we may encounter in the future  will not adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  from time to time  there are efforts in states with certificate of need laws to weaken those laws  which could potentially increase competition in those states 
conversely  competition and statutory procedural requirements in some certificate of need states may inhibit our ability to expand our operations 

table of contents we may have difficulty completing acquisitions  investments  joint ventures or de novo developments consistent with our growth strategy  or we may make investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures that may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities 
we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of  investments in  and joint ventures with rehabilitative healthcare providers and  in the longer term  may do so with other complementary post acute healthcare operations 
we may face limitations on our ability to identify sufficient acquisition targets to meet goals or projections 
acquisitions identified and completed may involve material cash expenditures  debt incurrence  operating losses  amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies  issuances of equity securities  and expenses that could affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
acquisitions  investments  and joint ventures involve numerous risks  including limitations  including state certificates of need as well as cms and other regulatory approval requirements  on our ability to complete such acquisitions  particularly those involving not for profit providers  on terms  timetables  and valuations reasonable to us  limitations in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a cost reasonable to us  difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel  and information systems  and in realizing projected revenues  efficiencies and cost savings  or returns on invested capital  entry into markets  businesses or services in which we may have little or no experience  diversion of business resources or management s attention from ongoing business operations  and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired operations  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and anti trust considerations in specific markets 
in addition to those development activities  we intend to build new  or de novo  inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
the construction of new hospitals involves numerous risks  including the receipt of all zoning and other regulatory approvals  such as a certificate of need where necessary  construction delays and cost over runs 
once built  new hospitals must undergo the state and medicare certification process 
we may be unable to operate newly constructed hospitals as profitably as expected  and those hospitals may involve significant additional cash expenditures and operating expenses that could  in the aggregate  have an adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we are a defendant in various lawsuits  and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases  the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry 
as a result  various lawsuits  claims  and legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us 
we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits  and the material lawsuits are discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us or settlements agreed to could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
additionally  the costs of defending litigation and investigations  even if frivolous or nonmeritorious  could be significant 
we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability  general liability  and workers compensation liability risks through our captive insurance subsidiary  as discussed further in note  self insured risks  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
changes in the number of these liability claims and the cost to resolve them impact the reserves for these risks 
a variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the reserves for these liability risks  which could have an effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the proper function  availability  and security of our information systems is critical to our business 
we are dependent on the proper function  availability and security of our information systems  including our new electronic clinical information system which plays a substantial role in the operations of the hospitals in which it is installed 
we undertake substantial measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems  and we regularly test the adequacy of our security and disaster recovery measures 
we have installed privacy protection systems and devices on our network and electronic devices in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to that data  which includes patient information subject to the protections of the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act 
for additional discussion of these laws  see item  business  regulation 
as part of our efforts  we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the 
table of contents threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches  including unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems 
however  there can be no assurance our safety and security measures or our disaster recovery plan will detect and prevent security breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent damage or interruption of our systems and operations 
we may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning  security breach or unavailability of our information systems 
we may be held liable to our patients and regulators  which could result in fines  litigation  or negative publicity 
failure to maintain proper function  security  and availability of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
our electronic clinical information system is subject to a licensing  implementation  technology hosting  and support agreement with cerner corporation 
in june  we entered into an agreement with cerner to begin a company wide implementation of this system in our inability  or the inability of cerner  to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems  software  and hardware could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 
in addition  costs  unexpected problems  and interruptions associated with the implementation or transition to new systems or technology or with adequate support of those systems or technology across multiple hospitals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
successful execution of our current business plan depends on our key personnel 
the success of our current business plan depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals 
we rely upon their ability  expertise  judgment  discretion  integrity and good faith 
there can be no assurance that we will retain our key executives and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future 
if we lose key personnel  we may be unable to replace them with personnel of comparable experience in  or knowledge of  the healthcare provider industry or our specific post acute segment 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
our leverage or level of indebtedness may have negative consequences for our business  and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
although we have reduced our outstanding long term debt substantially in recent years  we still had approximately billion of long term debt outstanding including that portion of long term debt classified as current and excluding million in capital leases as of december  see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
subject to specified limitations  our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes permit us and our subsidiaries to incur material additional debt 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the risks described here could intensify 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  including limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes  making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for  and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to  changing conditions  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competing providers that have less debt  and exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations for outstanding amounts under our credit facility  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
we are subject to contingent liabilities  prevailing economic conditions  and financial  business  and other factors beyond our control 
although we expect to make scheduled interest payments and principal reductions  we cannot assure you changes in our business or other factors will not occur that may have the effect of preventing us from satisfying obligations under our debt instruments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other needs  we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt  obtain additional financing or reduce expenditures or sell assets we deem necessary to our business 
we cannot assure you any of these measures would be possible or any additional financing could be obtained 

table of contents the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes could affect our ability to execute aspects of our business plan successfully 
the terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes do  and our future debt instruments may  contain various provisions that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things incur or guarantee indebtedness  pay dividends on  or redeem or repurchase  our capital stock  or repay  redeem or repurchase our subordinated obligations  issue or sell certain types of preferred stock  make investments  incur obligations that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us  sell assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  and merge  consolidate  or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities 
for additional discussion of our material debt covenants  see the liquidity and capital resources section of item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  long term debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we remained in compliance with the financial ratios and financial condition tests as of december   we cannot assure you we will continue to do so 
events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests 
a severe downturn in earnings or  if we have outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the time  a rapid increase in interest rates could impair our ability to comply with those financial ratios and financial condition tests and we may need to obtain waivers from the required proportion of the lenders to avoid being in default 
if we try to obtain a waiver or other relief from the required lenders  we may not be able to obtain it or such relief might have a material cost to us or be on terms less favorable than those in our existing debt 
if a default occurs  the lenders could exercise their rights  including declaring all the funds borrowed together with accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable  terminating their commitments or instituting foreclosure proceedings against our assets  which  in turn  could cause the default and acceleration of the maturity of our other indebtedness 
a breach of any other restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement or the indentures governing our senior notes would also after giving effect to applicable grace periods  if any result in an event of default with the same outcome 
as of december   approximately of our consolidated property and equipment  net held by healthsouth corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries was pledged to the lenders under our credit agreement 
see note  long term debt  and note  condensed consolidating financial information  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and item  properties 
uncertainty in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our development objectives 
the global and sovereign credit markets experienced significant disruptions in recent years  and economic conditions remained volatile in  resulting in unsettled credit markets 
future market shocks could result in reductions in the availability of certain types of debt financing  including access to revolving lines of credit 
future business needs combined with market conditions at the time may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
tight credit markets  such as might result from further turmoil in the 
table of contents sovereign debt markets  would likely make additional financing more expensive and difficult to obtain 
the inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our growth opportunities 
as a result of credit market uncertainty  we also face potential exposure to counterparties who may be unable to adequately service our needs  including the ability of the lenders under our credit agreement to provide liquidity when needed 
we monitor the financial strength of our depositories  creditors  and insurance carriers using publicly available information  as well as qualitative inputs 
we may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had an unused federal net operating loss carryforward nol of approximately million approximately billion on a gross basis and state nols of approximately million 
such losses expire in various amounts at varying times through unless they expire  these nols may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our income taxes otherwise payable 
while we believe we will be able to use a substantial portion of these tax benefits before they expire  no such assurances can be provided 
for further discussion of our nols  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance of approximately million against our deferred tax assets 
at the state jurisdiction level  based on the weight of the available evidence including our operating performance in recent years  the scheduled reversal of temporary differences  our forecast of taxable income in future periods in each applicable tax jurisdiction  our ability to sustain a core level of earnings  and the availability of prudent tax planning strategies  we determined it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize a portion of the deferred tax assets  primarily related to state nols  before they expire 
the amount of the valuation allowance has been determined for each tax jurisdiction based on the weight of all available evidence  as described above  including management s estimates of taxable income for each jurisdiction in which we operate over the periods in which the related deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if management s expectations for future operating results on a consolidated basis or at the state jurisdiction level vary from actual results due to changes in healthcare regulations  general economic conditions  or other factors  we may need to increase our valuation allowance  or reverse amounts recorded currently in the valuation allowance  for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
similarly  future adjustments to our valuation allowance may be necessary if the timing of future tax deductions is different than currently expected 
our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowance in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
section of the internal revenue code section imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its nols to reduce its tax liability 
an ownership change is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than of a corporation s stock by its percent shareholders as defined in section over a rolling three year period based upon each of those shareholder s lowest percentage of stock owned during such period 
it is possible that future transactions  not all of which would be within our control  could cause us to undergo an ownership change as defined in section in that event  we would not be able to use our pre ownership change nols in excess of the limitation imposed by section at this time  we do not believe these limitations will affect our ability to use any nols before they expire 
however  no such assurances can be provided 
if we are unable to fully utilize our nols to offset taxable income generated in the future  our results of operations and cash flows could be materially and negatively impacted 
additionally  the imposition of an annual limit could result in it taking longer to utilize our nols  which would adversely affect the present value of those tax assets

executive overview our business we are the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated and discharged  revenues  and number of hospitals 
while our national network of inpatient hospitals stretches across states and puerto rico  our inpatient hospitals are concentrated in the eastern half of the united states and texas 
as of december   we operated inpatient rehabilitation hospitals including hospitals that operate as joint ventures which we account for using the equity method of accounting  outpatient rehabilitation satellite clinics operated by our hospitals  and licensed  hospital based home health agencies 
in addition to healthsouth hospitals  we manage inpatient rehabilitation units through management contracts 
our core business is providing inpatient rehabilitative services 
our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across a wide array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive  high quality  cost effective patient care services 
the majority of patients we serve experience significant physical and cognitive disabilities due to medical conditions  such as neurological disorders  strokes  hip fractures  head injuries  and spinal cord injuries  that are generally nondiscretionary in nature and require rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting 
our teams of highly skilled nurses and physical  occupational  and speech therapists utilize proven technology and clinical protocols with the objective of returning patients to home and work 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by physician orders while case managers monitor each patient s progress and provide documentation and oversight of patient status  achievement of goals  discharge planning  and functional outcomes 
our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leads to a higher level of care and superior outcomes 
overview our strategy focused on the following priorities continuing to provide high quality  cost effective care to patients in our existing markets while seeking incremental efficiencies in our cost structure  achieving organic growth at our existing hospitals  
table of contents continuing to expand our services to more patients who require inpatient rehabilitative services by constructing and opportunistically acquiring new hospitals in new markets  and continuing to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet 
during  discharge growth of coupled with a increase in net patient revenue per discharge generated growth in net patient revenue from our hospitals compared to discharge growth was comprised of growth from new stores and a increase in same store discharges 
our quality and outcome measures  as reported through the uniform data system for medical rehabilitation the uds  remained well above the average for hospitals included in the uds database  and they did so while we continued to increase our market share throughout as evidenced by the decrease in our total operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues  we also achieved incremental efficiencies in our cost structure 
see the results of operations section of this item 
our growth efforts also continued to yield positive results in specifically  we continued development of the following de novo hospitals location of beds expected construction start date expected operational date littleton  colorado south denver q q stuart  florida a joint venture with martin health system q q greater orlando  florida market q q middletown  delaware tbd tbd williamson county  tennessee tbd tbd newnan  georgia tbd tbd we have been awarded a certificate of need from the state authority  the award of which is under appeal 
acquired inpatient rehabilitation beds in andalusia  alabama from a subsidiary of lifepoint hospitals in order to add beds at our existing hospital in dothan  alabama  acquired the bed inpatient rehabilitation unit of christus santa rosa hospital medical center 
the operations of this unit have been relocated to and consolidated with our existing hospital in san antonio  texas  entered into a letter of intent to acquire walton rehabilitation hospital  a bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in augusta  georgia 
this transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of broke ground on a replacement hospital for healthsouth rehabilitation hospital of western massachusetts which is currently leased 
we expect to relocate operations from the currently leased hospital to the new facility in december  began accepting patients at our newly built  bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in ocala  florida in december  and added beds to existing hospitals 
we also continued to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet in we improved our overall debt profile in august by amending our credit agreement to increase the capacity  reduce the interest rate spread  and extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility 
then  in september  we completed a registered public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due at a public offering price of of the principal amount  the proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and redeem of the outstanding principal amount of our existing senior notes due and our existing senior notes due as a result of these transactions and our continued strong cash flows from operations  our liquidity increased from approximately million as of december  to approximately million as of december  in addition  we repurchased  shares of our convertible perpetual preferred stock for million 
we also purchased  in conjunction with our joint venture partner  the land and building previously subject to an operating lease associated with our joint venture hospital in

see the liquidity and capital resources section of this item and note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
business outlook we believe our business outlook remains reasonably positive primarily for two reasons 
first  demographic trends  such as population aging  will positively affect long term demand for healthcare services 
while we treat patients of all ages  most of our patients are persons and older median age of a healthsouth patient is years and have conditions such as strokes  hip fractures  and a variety of debilitating neurological conditions that are generally nondiscretionary in nature 
we believe the demand for inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services will increase as the us population ages and life expectancies increase 
the number of medicare eligible patients is expected to grow approximately per year for the foreseeable future  creating an attractive market 
we believe these market factors align with our strengths in  and focus on  inpatient rehabilitative care 
unlike many of our competitors that may offer inpatient rehabilitation as one of many secondary services  inpatient rehabilitation is our core business 
in addition  we believe we can address the demand for inpatient rehabilitative services in markets where we currently do not have a presence by constructing or acquiring new hospitals 
second  we are the industry leader in this growing sector 
as the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on our broad platform of clinical expertise  the quality of our clinical outcomes  the application of rehabilitative technology  and the sustainability of best practices 
we have invested considerable resources into clinical and management systems and protocols that have allowed us to consistently lower costs 
our commitment to technology also includes the on going implementation of our rehabilitation specific electronic clinical information system 
we believe this system will improve patient care and safety  enhance operational efficiency  and set the stage for connectivity with referral sources and health information exchanges 
our hospitals also participate in the joint commission s disease specific care certification program 
under this program  joint commission accredited organizations  like our hospitals  may seek certification for chronic diseases or conditions such as brain injury or stroke rehabilitation by demonstrating compliance with national standards  demonstrating the effective use of evidence based clinical practice guidelines to manage and optimize patient care  and demonstrating an organized approach to performance measurement and evaluation of clinical outcomes 
obtaining such certifications demonstrates our commitment to excellence in providing disease specific care 
currently  of our hospitals hold one or more disease specific certifications 
while we do not anticipate any significant change to the long term demand for inpatient rehabilitative care or our ability to provide this care on a high quality  cost effective basis  we do expect continued uncertainty surrounding the potential for future changes to the medicare program 
despite this uncertainty  we will continue to maintain our focus on providing high quality care while seeking incremental efficiencies in our cost structure 
our growth strategy remains focused on organic growth and development activities  and we believe continued growth in our adjusted ebitda and our strong cash flows from operations will allow us to invest in these growth opportunities 
we also will continue to consider additional shareholder value enhancing strategies such as repurchases of our common and preferred stock  common stock dividends  and  if deemed prudent  further reductions to our long term debt  recognizing that some of these actions may increase our leverage ratio 
on february   our board of directors approved an increase in our existing common stock repurchase authorization from million to million 
we intend to pursue a tender offer for our common stock for up to the full amount of this authorization 
see the liquidity and capital resources stock repurchase authorization section of this item 
healthcare has always been a highly regulated industry  and we have cautioned our stockholders that future medicare payment rates could be at risk 
while the medicare reimbursement environment may be challenging  the demand for inpatient rehabilitative services is expected to grow 
healthsouth has a proven track record of adapting to and succeeding in a highly regulated environment  and we believe healthsouth is well positioned to continue to succeed and grow in the years to come 
we have adopted strategies to better prepare us to absorb reimbursement risks 
further  we believe the regulatory and reimbursement risks discussed throughout this report may present us with opportunities to grow by acquiring or consolidating the operations of other inpatient rehabilitation providers in our highly fragmented industry 
we have been disciplined in creating a capital structure that is flexible with no significant debt maturities prior to over the past few years  we have redeemed our most expensive debt and reduced our interest expense 
we have not acquired companies outside our core business 
rather  we have invested in our core business and created an infrastructure that enables us to provide high quality care on a cost effective basis 
our balance sheet remains strong 
our leverage ratio is within our target range  we have ample availability under our revolving credit facility  we continue to generate strong cash flows from operations  and we have flexibility with how we choose to invest our cash 
for these and other reasons  we believe we will be able to adapt to any changes in reimbursement and sustain our business model 
we also believe we will be in a position to take action should a properly sized and priced acquisition or consolidation opportunity arise 

table of contents key challenges the healthcare industry is currently facing many well publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges 
it always has been a highly regulated industry  and the inpatient rehabilitation sector is no exception 
successful healthcare providers are those who provide high quality  cost effective care and have the ability to adjust to changes in the regulatory environment 
we believe we have the necessary capabilities scale  infrastructure  and management to adapt to and succeed in a highly regulated industry  and we have a proven track record of doing so 
as we continue to execute our business plan  the following are some of the challenges we face reduced medicare reimbursement 
our challenges related to reduced medicare reimbursement are discussed in item  business  regulatory and reimbursement challenges  and item a  risk factors 
we currently estimate sequestration will result in a net decrease in our net operating revenues of approximately million in additionally  concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions  further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program  or both 
we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions  if any  will ultimately be enacted into law  or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us 
if enacted  such initiatives or reductions would likely be challenging for all providers  would likely have the effect of limiting medicare beneficiaries access to healthcare services  and could have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
however  we believe our efficient cost structure and substantial owned real estate coupled with the steps we have taken to reduce our debt and corresponding debt service obligations should allow us to absorb  adjust to  or mitigate any potential initiative or payment reductions more easily than most other inpatient rehabilitation providers 
changes to our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform 
our challenges related to healthcare reform are discussed in item  business  regulatory and reimbursement challenges  and sources of revenue medicare reimbursement  and item a  risk factors 
many provisions within the healthcare reform laws as defined in item  business  regulatory and reimbursement challenges have impacted  or could in the future impact  our business 
most notably for us are the reductions in our annual market basket updates 
in addition  the healthcare reform laws require the market basket update to be reduced further by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis 
the reductions to our market basket update in effect for fiscal year and our estimates of the reductions for fiscal year are presented in the table below 
the amounts presented exclude the automatic reduction to our rates due to sequestration fiscal year q q fiscal year q q market basket update healthcare reform reduction basis points basis points productivity adjustment basis points approximately basis points uses the rule as discussed and defined below for fiscal year and management s estimates for fiscal year on july   the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services cms released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year the rule for irfs under the prospective payment system irf pps 
as shown in the above table  the rule is effective for medicare discharges between october  and september  and includes certain reductions to our market basket update 
it also includes other pricing changes that impact our hospital by hospital base rate for medicare reimbursement 
based on our analysis which utilizes  among other things  the acuity of our patients over the month period prior to the rule s release  and which incorporates other adjustments included in the rule and the productivity adjustment discussed above  we believe the rule will result in a net increase to our medicare payment rates of approximately effective october   before applying the effect of sequestration 
given the complexity and the number of changes in the healthcare reform laws  we cannot predict their ultimate impact 
we will continue to evaluate these laws  and  based on our track record  we believe we can adapt to these regulatory changes 
further  we have engaged  and will continue to engage  actively in discussions with 
table of contents key legislators and regulators to attempt to ensure any healthcare laws or regulations adopted or amended promote our goal of high quality  cost effective care 
maintaining strong volume growth 
as discussed above  the majority of patients we serve experience significant physical and cognitive disabilities due to medical conditions  such as neurological disorders  strokes  hip fractures  head injuries  and spinal cord injuries  that are generally nondiscretionary in nature and which require rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting 
in addition  because most of our patients are persons and older  our patients generally have insurance coverage through medicare 
however  we do treat some patients with medical conditions that are discretionary in nature 
during periods of economic uncertainty  patients may choose to forgo discretionary procedures 
we believe this is one of the factors creating weakness in the number of patients admitted to and discharged from acute care hospitals 
because approximately of our patients are referred to us by acute care hospitals  if these patients continue to forgo procedures and acute care providers report soft volumes  it may be more challenging for us to maintain our recent volume growth rates 
recruiting and retaining high quality personnel 
our operations are dependent on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our medical personnel  such as physical therapists  occupational therapists  speech pathologists  nurses  and other healthcare professionals 
in some markets  the lack of availability of medical personnel is an operating issue facing all healthcare providers 
we have maintained a comprehensive compensation and benefits package to attempt to remain competitive in this challenging staffing environment while remaining consistent with our goal of being a high quality  cost effective provider of inpatient rehabilitative services 
unlike certain other post acute settings  patients treated in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals require and receive significantly more intensive services because of their acute medical conditions 
this includes hour per day  seven days per week supervision by registered nurses 
as part of our efforts to continue to provide high quality inpatient rehabilitative services  our hospitals are utilizing more certified rehabilitation registered nurses crrns 
we encourage our nursing professionals to seek crrn certifications via salary incentives and tuition reimbursement programs 
while these incentive programs increase our costs  we believe the benefits of increasing the number of crrns out weigh such costs and further differentiate us  in particular our quality of care  from other post acute providers 
recruiting and retaining qualified personnel for our hospitals will remain a high priority for us 
see also item a  risk factors 
operating in a highly regulated industry 
we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local government levels 
these rules and regulations have affected  or could in the future affect  our business activities by having an impact on the reimbursement we receive for services provided or the costs of compliance  mandating new documentation standards  requiring licensure or certification of our hospitals  regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources  regulating the use of our properties  and limiting our ability to enter new markets or add new beds to existing hospitals 
ensuring continuous compliance with these laws and regulations is an operating requirement for all healthcare providers 
reimbursement for our inpatient rehabilitation services is discussed above and in item  business  sources of revenues 
our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed under medicare s physician fee schedule 
by statute  the physician fee schedule is subject to annual automatic adjustment by a sustainable growth rate formula that has resulted in reductions in reimbursement rates every year since however  in each instance  congress has acted to suspend or postpone the effectiveness of these automatic reimbursement reductions

we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial time  effort  and expense in implementing and maintaining internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance  and we are committed to continued adherence to these guidelines 
more specifically  because medicare comprises a significant portion of our net operating revenues  it is important for us to remain compliant with the laws and regulations governing the medicare program and related matters including anti kickback and anti fraud requirements 
if we were unable to remain compliant with these regulations  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially  adversely impacted 
see also item  business  regulation  and item a  risk factors 
we are very proud of what we have accomplished in  and we look forward to the year ahead 
these key challenges notwithstanding  we have a strong business model  a strong balance sheet  and a proven track record of achieving 
table of contents strong financial and operational results 
we are in a position to continue to grow  adapt to external events  and create value for our shareholders in and beyond 
results of operations reclassifications effective january   we adopted accounting standards update  healthcare entities topic  presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain healthcare entities  which requires certain healthcare entities to present the provision for doubtful accounts relating to patient service revenue as a deduction from patient service revenue in the statement of operations rather than as an operating expense 
all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
our adoption of this standard had no net impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
this standard also requires healthcare entities to provide enhanced disclosure about their policies for recognizing revenue and assessing bad debts  as well as qualitative and quantitative information about changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
see the net operating revenues and accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts sections of note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we negotiated with our partner to amend the joint venture agreement related to st 
vincent rehabilitation hospital which resulted in a change in accounting for this hospital from the equity method of accounting to a consolidated entity 
the amendment revised certain participatory rights held by our joint venture partner resulting in healthsouth gaining control of this entity from an accounting perspective

payor mix during   and  we derived consolidated net operating revenues from the following payor sources for the year ended december  medicare medicaid workers compensation managed care and other discount plans other third party payors patients other income total our payor mix is weighted heavily towards medicare 
our hospitals receive medicare reimbursements under irf pps 
under irf pps  our hospitals receive fixed payment amounts per discharge based on certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by the united states department of health and human services 
under irf pps  our hospitals retain the difference  if any  between the fixed payment from medicare and their operating costs 
thus  our hospitals benefit from being high quality  low cost providers 
for additional information regarding medicare reimbursement  see the sources of revenues section of item  business 
during  we experienced an increase in managed medicare and private fee for service plans that are included in the managed care and other discount plans category in the above table 
as part of the balanced budget act of  congress created a program of private  managed healthcare coverage for medicare beneficiaries 
this program has been referred to as medicare part c  or medicare advantage 
the program offers beneficiaries a range of medicare coverage options by providing a choice between the traditional fee for service program under medicare parts a and b or enrollment in a health maintenance organization hmo  preferred provider organization ppo  point of service plan  provider sponsor organization  or an insurance plan operated in conjunction with a medical savings account 
prior to  private fee for service plans were not required to build provider networks  did not have the same quality reporting requirements to cms as other plans  and were reimbursed by medicare at a higher rate 
in  these requirements and reimbursement rates were revised to be similar to other existing payor plans 
as these requirements changed  payors began actively marketing and converting their 
table of contents members from private fee for service plans to one of their existing hmo or ppo plans  where provider networks and reporting requirements were already established  or back to traditional medicare coverage 
this shift of payors from private fee for service plans back to traditional medicare can be seen in the above table 
our consolidated net operating revenues consist primarily of revenues derived from patient care services 
net operating revenues also include other revenues generated from management and administrative fees and other nonpatient care services 
these other revenues approximated   and of consolidated net operating revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
under irf pps  hospitals are reimbursed on a per discharge basis 
thus  the number of patient discharges is a key metric utilized by management to monitor and evaluate our performance 
the number of outpatient visits is also tracked in order to measure the volume of outpatient activity each period

full time equivalents included in the above table represent healthsouth employees who participate in or support the operations of our hospitals and exclude an estimate of full time equivalents related to contract labor 
we actively manage the productive portion of our salaries and benefits utilizing certain metrics  including employees per occupied bed  or epob 
this metric is determined by dividing the number of full time equivalents  including an estimate of full time equivalents from the utilization of contract labor  by the number of occupied beds during each period 
the number of occupied beds is determined by multiplying the number of licensed beds by our occupancy percentage 
in the discussion that follows  we use same store comparisons to explain the changes in certain performance metrics and line items within our financial statements 
we calculate same store comparisons based on hospitals open throughout both the full current period and prior periods presented 
these comparisons include the financial results of market consolidation transactions in existing markets  as it is difficult to determine  with precision  the incremental impact of these transactions on our results of operations 

table of contents compared to net operating revenues net patient revenue from our hospitals was higher for the year ended december  than the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a increase in patient discharges and a increase in net patient revenue per discharge 
discharge growth was comprised of growth from new stores and a increase in same store discharges 
discharge growth was enhanced during compared to by the additional day in february due to leap year as well as a basis point increase in discharges resulting from the consolidation of st 
vincent rehabilitation hospital beginning in the third quarter of  as described above 
net patient revenue per discharge in benefited from pricing adjustments from medicare as discussed in item  business  sources of revenues and managed care payors  higher average acuity for the patients served  and a higher percentage of medicare patients as shown in the above payor mix table 
outpatient and other revenues include the receipt of state provider taxes 
a number of states in which we operate hospitals assess a provider tax to certain healthcare providers 
those tax revenues at the state level are generally matched by federal funds 
in order to induce healthcare providers to serve low income patients  many states redistribute a substantial portion of these funds back to the various providers 
these redistributions are based on different metrics than those used to assess the tax  and are thus in different amounts and proportions than the initial tax assessment 
as a result  some providers receive a net benefit while others experience a net expense 
see the discussion of other operating expenses below for information on state provider tax expenses 
while state provider taxes are a regular component of our operating results  during  a new provider tax was implemented in pennsylvania where we operate nine inpatient hospitals 
as a result of the implementation of this new provider tax in pennsylvania  we recorded approximately million in revenues related to the period from july  through december  when we were notified by pennsylvania of the specific provider tax refund to be issued to us after pennsylvania had received approval from cms on its amended state plan relative to these taxes 
excluding the state provider tax refunds discussed above  outpatient and other revenues decreased during compared to due to the decrease in outpatient volumes  the closure of outpatient satellite clinics in prior periods  and a reduction in home health pricing related to the medicare home health rule 
outpatient volumes in the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by the implementation of therapy caps to all hospital based outpatient programs 
the middle class tax relief and job creation act of applied therapy caps limiting how much medicare will pay for medically necessary outpatient therapy services per medicare patient in any one calendar year starting october  when this was implemented in october  many medicare beneficiaries had already reached their cap limit for and chose not to receive additional outpatient therapy services since such services would not be covered by medicare 
the decrease in outpatient volumes was slightly offset by an increase in the number of home health visits included in these volume metrics 
provision for doubtful accounts as disclosed previously  we have experienced denials of certain diagnosis codes by medicare contractors based on medical necessity 
we dispute  or appeal  most of these denials  and we have historically collected approximately of all amounts denied 
the resolution of these disputes can take in excess of one year  and we cannot provide assurance as to the ongoing and future success of these disputes 
as such  we make provisions against these receivables in accordance with our accounting policy that necessarily considers historical collection trends of the receivables in this review process as part of our provision for doubtful accounts 
therefore  as we experience increases or decreases in these denials  or if our actual collections of these denials differs from our estimated collections  we may experience volatility in our provision for doubtful accounts 
see also item  business  sources of revenues medicare reimbursement  to this report 
the change in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenues in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in medicare claim denials and a lengthening in the related adjudication process 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits are the most significant cost to us and represent an investment in our most important asset our employees 
salaries and benefits include all amounts paid to full and part time employees who directly participate in or support the operations of our hospitals  including all related costs of benefits provided to employees 
it also includes amounts paid for contract labor 
salaries and benefits increased in compared to primarily due to increased patient volumes  including an increase in the number of full time equivalents as a result of our and development activities and the consolidation of 
table of contents st 
vincent rehabilitation hospital discussed above  an approximate merit increase provided to employees on october   a change in the skills mix of employees at our hospitals  and a one time  merit based  year end bonus paid in the fourth quarter of to all eligible nonmanagement employees 
as part of the standardization of our labor practices across all of our hospitals and as part of our efforts to continue to provide high quality inpatient rehabilitative services  our hospitals are utilizing more registered nurses and crrns  which increases our average cost per full time equivalent  and fewer licensed practical nurses 
these increases were offset by reductions in self insured workers compensation costs primarily due to revised actuarial estimates resulting from better than expected claims experience in prior years and a reduction in group medical costs due to favorable claim trends 
we did not grant a merit increase to our employees on october  rather  we replaced merit increases in with a one time  merit based  year end bonus paid in the fourth quarter of to all eligible nonmanagement employees 
we did this to reward our nonmanagement employees for their performance in while not carrying the additional costs associated with a merit increase into and beyond where we face the impact of sequestration and the risk of potential additional medicare reimbursement reductions 
salaries and benefits increased by approximately million in the fourth quarter of as a result of this special bonus 
this bonus was approximately million more than would have been included in our fourth quarter results had we given a merit increase to all nonmanagement employees effective october  in addition  because merit increases were foregone in  management has determined the company will absorb all of the increased costs associated with medical plan benefits to employees in salaries and benefits as a percent of net operating revenues increased in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the higher skills mix of our employees in compared to  the one time bonus discussed above  and the ramping up of operations at our newly opened hospital in ocala  florida ie  costs with no to little revenues offset by continued improvement in labor productivity  as shown in our epob metric above 
hospital related expenses other operating expenses other operating expenses include costs associated with managing and maintaining our hospitals 
these expenses include such items as contract services  utilities  non income related taxes  insurance  professional fees  and repairs and maintenance 
as a percent of net operating revenues  other operating expenses decreased during compared to due primarily to our increasing revenue base as well as a decrease in self insurance costs in as disclosed previously  we update our actuarial estimates surrounding our self insurance reserves in june and december of each year 
self insurance costs associated with professional and general liability risks were less in than in due to revised actuarial estimates resulting from better than expected claims experience in prior years 
see note  self insured risks  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses in included approximately million of expenses associated with the implementation of the new pennsylvania state provider tax program  as discussed above  offset by a million nonrecurring franchise tax recovery 
other operating expenses associated with the implementation of our electronic clinical information system were approximately million higher in than in occupancy costs occupancy costs include amounts paid for rent associated with leased hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation satellite clinics  including common area maintenance and similar charges 
these costs decreased as a percent of net operating revenues in compared to due to our purchase of the land and building previously subject to an operating lease associated with our joint venture hospital in fayetteville  arkansas 
occupancy costs are expected to continue to decrease as a percent of net operating revenues going forward 
supplies supplies expense includes all costs associated with supplies used while providing patient care 
these costs include pharmaceuticals  food  needles  bandages  and other similar items 
supplies expense decreased as a percent of net operating revenues in compared to due to our increasing revenue base  our supply chain efforts  and our continual focus on monitoring and actively managing pharmaceutical costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily include administrative expenses such as information technology services  corporate accounting  human resources  internal audit and controls  and legal services that are managed from our corporate headquarters in birmingham  alabama 
these expenses also include all stock based compensation expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during compared to primarily resulted from increased expenses associated with stock based compensation 
our restricted stock awards contain vesting requirements that include a service condition  market condition  performance condition  or a combination thereof 
due to the company s recent operating performance  our noncash expenses associated with these awards increased in depreciation and amortization while our capital expenditures increased during the latter half of and all of  the majority of these expenditures related to land and construction in progress for our de novo hospitals and capitalized software costs associated with the implementation of our electronic clinical information system at our hospitals 
depreciation on these assets  excluding land which is nondepreciable  does not begin until the applicable assets are placed in service 
therefore  while we expect depreciation and amortization to increase going forward  we did not experience a significant increase in these charges during government  class action  and related settlements the gain included in government  class action  and related settlements in and resulted from the recovery of assets from richard scrushy  as discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
professional fees accounting  tax  and legal in and  professional fees accounting  tax  and legal related primarily to legal and consulting fees for continued litigation and support matters arising from prior reporting and restatement issues 
these fees in and specifically included million and million  respectively  related to our obligation to pay of any recovery from richard scrushy to the attorneys for the derivative shareholder plaintiffs  as discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees the decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees during compared to was due to a decrease in our average borrowings outstanding and a decrease in our average cash interest rate 
during  we reduced total debt by approximately million  including the redemption of our senior notes due our average cash interest rate was during compared to for our average cash interest rate decreased as a result of the redemption of the senior notes due during  which was our most expensive debt  as well as the amendment to our credit agreement in may which reduced by basis points each of the various applicable interest rates for any outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 
in addition  pricing on our term loan and revolving credit facility declined an additional basis points in the third quarter of in conformity with our credit agreement s leverage grid

income from continuing operations before income tax expense excluding the loss on early extinguishment of debt during  the increase in our pre tax income from continuing operations in compared to resulted from increased net operating revenues  improved operating leverage and labor productivity  and a decrease in interest expense 
provision for income tax expense due to our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nols  we currently estimate our cash income tax expense to be approximately million to million per year due primarily to state income tax expense of subsidiaries which have separate state filing requirements  alternative minimum taxes  and federal income taxes for subsidiaries not included in our federal consolidated income tax return 
for the years ended december  and  cash income tax expense was million and million  respectively 
our effective income tax rate for was 
our provision for income tax expense in was less than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of noncontrolling interests and a decrease in the valuation allowance offset by state income tax expense 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the allocation of income or loss related to pass through entities  which we refer to as the impact of noncontrolling interests in this discussion 
our effective income tax rate for was 
the provision for income tax expense in was less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to an approximate million benefit associated with a current period net reduction in the valuation allowance and an approximate million net benefit associated with settlements with various taxing authorities including the settlement of federal income tax claims with the internal revenue service for tax years and offset by approximately million of net expense primarily related to corrections to deferred tax assets associated with our nols and corresponding valuation allowance 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  out of period adjustments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in certain state jurisdictions  we do not expect to generate sufficient income to use all of the available nols prior to their expiration 
this determination is based on our evaluation of all available evidence in these jurisdictions including results of operations during the preceding three years  our forecast of future earnings  and prudent tax planning strategies 
it is possible we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance at some future time if our forecast of future earnings varies from actual results on a consolidated basis or in the applicable state tax jurisdiction  or if the timing of future tax deductions differs from our expectations 
as part of our continued efforts to maximize our income tax benefits  we requested a pre filing agreement with the irs  the primary purpose of which was to consider whether certain amounts related to the restatement of our financial statements for periods prior to result in net increases to our federal nol and adjustments to other tax attributes 
the pre filing agreement program permits taxpayers to resolve certain tax issues in advance of filing their corporate income tax returns 
during the year ended december   the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately million based on these developments 
due to the unique nature of our claims and uncertainties around this process  we did not recognize any amounts associated with our request as of december  in july  the irs granted our request to utilize the pre filing agreement process 
depending upon the process undertaken by the irs to audit and settle these matters  the accounting recognition criteria for these positions could be met either in part or in total as the process continues or upon completion of the process 
therefore  as we continue this process with the irs  it is reasonably possible that over the next twelve month period we may experience an increase or decrease to our unrecognized tax benefits  our nols  other tax attributes  or any combination thereof that could have a material net favorable impact on income tax expense and our effective income tax rate 
due to the aforementioned uncertainties regarding the outcome of this process  it is not possible to determine the range of any impact at this time

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners in our consolidated affiliates 
fluctuations in these amounts are primarily driven by the financial performance of the applicable hospital population each period 
other factors that increased amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in over include bed additions at joint venture hospitals  the consolidation of st

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is expected to increase by approximately million in due to changes at two of our existing hospitals 
we have entered into an agreement to convert our owned hospital in jonesboro  arkansas into a joint venture with st 
bernards healthcare 
following the formation of the joint venture  our ownership percentage will be reduced to approximately 
this transaction is consistent with our strategy of aligning with high quality acute care hospitals in key markets 
in addition  our share of profits from our joint venture hospital in memphis  tennessee will decrease in from to pursuant to the terms of that partnership agreement entered into in compared to net operating revenues net patient revenue from our hospitals was higher for the year ended december  than the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a increase in patient discharges and a increase in net patient revenue per discharge 
discharge growth included a increase in same store discharges 
net patient revenue per discharge increased primarily due to pricing adjustments from medicare and managed care payors  a higher percentage of medicare patients as shown in the above payor mix table  and a higher percentage of neurological cases which increased the average acuity for the patients we served 
on october   we received a market basket update that was reduced to under the requirements of the healthcare reform laws 
as discussed above  during  a new provider tax was implemented in pennsylvania where we operate nine inpatient hospitals 
as a result of the implementation of this new provider tax in pennsylvania  we recorded approximately million in related to the period from july  through december  when we were notified by pennsylvania of the specific provider tax refund to be issued to us after pennsylvania had received approval from cms on its amended state plan relative to these taxes 
excluding the pennsylvania provider taxes  outpatient and other revenues would have been relatively flat year over year as the impact of the decrease in outpatient volumes and the closure of outpatient satellite clinics in prior periods was offset by an increase in the number of home health visits included in these volume metrics 
because home health visits receive a higher reimbursement rate per visit  we experienced an improvement in our net outpatient revenue per visit which offset a portion of the decrease in volume during compared to provision for doubtful accounts the change in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net operating revenues in was primarily the result of an increase in medicare claim denials offset by collections in excess of amounts previously reserved for denied claims 
in addition  we continued to benefit from the enhancements we implemented in to our processes around the capture and recovery of medicare related bad debts 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits increased from to primarily due to increased patient volumes  including an increase in the number of full time equivalents as a result of our and development activities  an approximate merit increase provided to employees on october   a change in the skills mix of employees at our hospitals  the training and orienting of new employees as a result of our increased volumes  and rising benefits costs

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased in compared to as a result of increased capital expenditures in both years and acquisitions in government  class action  and related settlements as discussed above  the gain included in government  class action  and related settlements in resulted from the recovery of assets from richard scrushy  as discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during  healthsouth was relieved of its contractual obligation to continue paying premiums on certain split dollar life insurance policies on the life of richard scrushy 
the split dollar life insurance policies were owned by trusts established by richard scrushy for the benefit of his children 
during  the split dollar policies were terminated and their net cash surrender proceeds in the amount of approximately million was divided among healthsouth  richard scrushy s wife  and the scrushy children s trusts

loss on interest rate swaps our loss on interest rate swaps represented amounts recorded related to the fair value adjustments and quarterly settlements recorded for our interest rate swaps that were not designated as hedges 
as discussed in note  derivative instruments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  both of our interest rate swaps not designated as hedges expired in march the last interest rate set date for these swaps was december  at that time  we accrued the final net settlement payments for these swaps 
therefore  we did not record any losses related to these swaps in the net loss recorded in represented the change in the market s expectations for interest rates over the remaining term of the swap agreements 
in addition  loss on interest rate swaps also included any ineffectiveness associated with our former two forward starting interest rate swaps that were designated as hedges 
in association with the refinancing transactions discussed in note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in  we terminated our two forward starting interest rate swaps 
accordingly  during  we reclassified the existing cumulative loss associated with these two swaps  or million  from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings in the line titled loss on interest rate swaps 
in addition  we recorded a million charge associated with the settlement payment to the counterparties as part of loss on interest rate swaps during in october  an unwind fee of million was paid to the counterparties under these agreements to effect the termination

provision for income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate for was 
our provision for income tax expense in was less than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to an approximate million benefit associated with a current period net reduction in the valuation allowance and an approximate million net benefit associated with settlements with various taxing authorities including the settlement of federal income tax claims with the irs for tax years and offset by approximately million of net income tax expense primarily related to corrections to deferred tax assets associated with our nols and corresponding valuation allowance 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  out of period adjustments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income tax benefit in primarily resulted from a reduction in the valuation allowance 
based on the weight of available evidence including our generation of pre tax income from continuing operations on a three year look back basis  our forecast of taxable income in future periods in each applicable tax jurisdiction  our ability to sustain a core level of earnings  and the availability of prudent tax planning strategies  we determined  in the fourth quarter of  it is more likely than not a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized on a federal basis and in certain state jurisdictions in the future and decreased our valuation allowance by million 
this benefit was offset by settlements related to federal irs examinations  including reductions in unrecognized tax benefits

table of contents net income attributable to noncontrolling interests amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in over due primarily to bed additions at joint venture hospitals 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company will be primarily in the area of labor costs 
the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
while we believe the current economic climate may help to moderate wage increases in the near term  there can be no guarantee we will not experience increases in the cost of labor  as the need for clinical healthcare professionals is expected to grow 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
our supply chain efforts and our continual focus on monitoring and actively managing pharmaceutical costs has enabled to us to accommodate increased pricing related to supplies and other operating expenses over the past few years 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases 
it should be noted that we have little or no ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing services to medicare and medicaid patients due to federal and state laws that establish fixed reimbursement rates

maintaining adequate liquidity includes supporting the execution of our operating and strategic plans and allowing us to weather temporary disruptions in the capital markets and general business environment 
maintaining flexibility in our capital structure includes limiting concentrations of debt maturities in any given year  allowing for debt prepayments without onerous penalties  and ensuring our debt agreements are limited in restrictive terms and maintenance covenants 
in the second quarter of  both moody s and s p upgraded our corporate credit rating 
as a result of our credit rating upgrades  and consistent with the above objectives  in august  we amended and restated our credit agreement to increase the size of our revolver from million to million  eliminate the former million term loan million outstanding  extend the revolver maturity from may to august  and lower the interest rate spread by basis points to an initial rate of libor plus 
in addition  in september  we completed a registered public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due at a public offering price of of the principal amount  the proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and redeem of the outstanding principal amount of our existing senior notes due and our existing senior notes due see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have been disciplined in creating a capital structure that is flexible with no significant debt maturities prior to our balance sheet remains strong 
our leverage ratio is within our target range  we have ample availability under our revolving credit facility  we continue to generate strong cash flows from operations  and we have flexibility with how we choose to invest our cash 
current liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount excludes million in restricted cash and million of restricted marketable securities million of restricted marketable securities are included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
our restricted assets pertain primarily to obligations associated with our captive insurance company  as well as obligations we have under agreements with joint venture partners 
see note  cash and marketable securities  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  as of december   we had approximately million available to us under our revolving credit facility 
our credit agreement governs the majority of our senior secured borrowing capacity and contains a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio as financial covenants 
our leverage ratio is defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of consolidated total debt less up to million of cash on hand to adjusted ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
our interest coverage ratio is defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest expense  excluding the amortization of financing fees  for the trailing four quarters 
as of december   the maximum leverage ratio requirement per our credit agreement was x and the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement was x  and we were in compliance with these covenants 
we do not face near term refinancing risk  as the amounts outstanding under our credit agreement do not mature until  and none of our bonds are due until and beyond 
see the contractual obligations section below for information related to our contractual obligations as of december  we anticipate we will continue to generate strong cash flows from operations that  together with availability under our revolving credit facility  will allow us to continue to invest in growth opportunities and continue to improve our existing core business 
we also will continue to consider additional shareholder value enhancing strategies such as repurchases of our

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from to primarily resulted from the increase in our net operating revenues  improved operating leverage  and a decrease in interest expense 
net cash provided by operating activities for included million related to the premium paid in conjunction with the redemption of our senior notes and a million decrease in the liability associated with refunds due patients and other third party payors 
the decrease in this liability primarily related to a settlement discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities during included million of proceeds from the sale of five of our ltchs in august excluding these proceeds  the increase in cash flows used in investing activities resulted from increased capital expenditures  including capitalized software costs  in compared to the increase in our capital expenditures in primarily resulted from de novo development activities including land purchases  increased hospital refresh projects  implementation of our electronic clinical information system  and the purchase of the real estate associated with our joint venture hospital in fayetteville  arkansas see also financing activities below 
financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities during included the repurchase of  shares of our convertible perpetual preferred stock  distributions to noncontrolling interests of consolidated affiliates  dividends paid on our preferred stock  and net principal payments on debt offset by capital contributions from consolidated affiliates primarily associated with the purchase of the real estate associated with our joint venture hospital in fayetteville  arkansas 
cash flows used in financing activities during included net principal payments on debt  including the redemption of our senior notes due  distributions to noncontrolling interests of consolidated affiliates  and dividends paid on our preferred stock 
net debt payments  including debt issue costs  were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
compared to operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from to primarily resulted from the increase in our net operating revenues and effective expense management 
as discussed above  net cash provided by operating activities for included million related to the premium paid in conjunction with the redemption of our senior notes in june and september and a million decrease in the liability associated with refunds due patients and other third party payors 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities during included million of proceeds from the sale of five of our ltchs in august  as discussed above and in note  assets and liabilities in and results of discontinued operations  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding these proceeds  the net increase in net cash used in investing activities year over year would have resulted from increased purchases of property and equipment in offset by the acquisition of two inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and net settlements on interest rate swaps during purchases of 
table of contents property and equipment increased in primarily due to our purchase of leased properties associated with two of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities during compared to resulted from the debt related transactions discussed in note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net debt payments  including debt issue costs  were approximately million during compared to approximately million of net debt payments during contractual obligations our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in millions total and thereafter long term debt obligations long term debt  excluding revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations a revolving credit facility interest on long term debt b capital lease obligations c operating lease obligations d e purchase obligations e f other long term liabilities g total a included in long term debt are amounts owed on our bonds payable and other notes payable

amounts exclude amortization of debt discounts  amortization of loan fees  or fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
c amounts include interest portion of future minimum capital lease payments 
d we lease approximately one third of our hospitals as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business 
some of our hospital leases require percentage rentals on patient revenues above specified minimums and contain escalation clauses 
the minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
e future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
f purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on healthsouth and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to software licensing and support 
g because their future cash outflows are uncertain  the following noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above general and professional liability and workers compensation risks  deferred income taxes  and our estimated liability for unsettled litigation 
for more information  see note  self insured risks  note  income taxes  and 
table of contents note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
also  at december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
at this time  we cannot estimate a range of the reasonably possible change that may occur 
we continue to actively pursue  through ongoing discussions with taxing authorities  the maximization of our income tax benefits  primarily related to our federal nol 
our capital expenditures include costs associated with our hospital refresh program  de novo projects  capacity expansions  technology initiatives  and building and equipment upgrades and purchases 
during the year ended december   we made capital expenditures of million for property and equipment and capitalized software 
approximately million of the amount spent were considered nondiscretionary expenditures 
capital expenditures in included the purchase of the real estate associated with our joint venture hospital in fayetteville  arkansas for approximately million  half of which was reimbursed to us by our joint venture partner through a capital contribution 
in addition  we used million for our acquisition activities  as discussed above 
during  we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures 
this range includes the estimated investment to replace our currently leased hospital in ludlow  massachusetts  but it excludes all other lease buy out opportunities  as it is difficult to estimate how these negotiations may proceed with our current landlords 
in addition  the estimated range for capital expenditures is exclusive of acquisitions 
the anticipated increase in over amounts spent for capital expenditures in is due to increased de novo and capacity expansion projects in actual amounts spent will be dependent upon the timing of construction projects 
approximately million to million of this budgeted amount is considered nondiscretionary expenditures 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  we expect to close the transaction to acquire walton rehabilitation hospital in augusta  georgia in the first quarter of stock repurchase authorization in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
no repurchases were made under this original authorization 
on february   our board of directors approved an increase in our existing common stock repurchase authorization from million to million 
the repurchase authorization does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares  has an indefinite term  and is subject to termination at any time by our board of directors 
subject to certain terms and conditions  including a maximum price per share and compliance with federal and state securities and other laws  we intend to pursue a tender offer for our common stock for up to the full amount of this authorization 
the specific timing and parameters will be dictated by market conditions 
any such tender offer would be funded with a combination of cash on hand and availability under our million revolving credit facility 
even if successful at the full amount authorized  any such tender offer would result in a modest impact on our leverage ratio  with the resulting ratio remaining within our target range 
we believe the contemplated tender offer is consistent with our strategy of deploying financial resources towards long term  shareholder value creating opportunities 
our board of directors also previously granted discretion to management to opportunistically repurchase from time to time  subject to similar conditions  warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement  dated as of january   with wells fargo bank northwest  na  as warrant agent  and up to million of our convertible perpetual preferred stock 
likewise  this authority did not require the purchase of a specific number of warrants or shares  had an indefinite term  and was subject to termination at any time by our board of directors 
the board of directors decision to increase the common stock repurchase authorization  as discussed above  on february  replaces this authorization for warrants and preferred stock 
see note  earnings per common share  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these warrants 
as discussed in note  convertible perpetual preferred stock  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we repurchased  shares of our preferred stock for million during adjusted ebitda management believes adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement is a measure of our ability to service our debt and our ability to make capital expenditures 
we reconcile adjusted ebitda to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities 
we use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because it is the key component of certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these covenants are material terms of the credit agreement 
noncompliance with these financial covenants under our credit agreement our interest coverage ratio and our leverage ratio could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
if we anticipated a potential covenant violation  we would seek relief 
table of contents from our lenders  which would have some cost to us  and such relief might not be on terms favorable to those in our existing credit agreement 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants  we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness  making certain payments  and acquiring and disposing of assets 
consequently  adjusted ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
in general terms  the credit agreement definition of adjusted ebitda  referred to as adjusted consolidated ebitda there  allows us to add back to consolidated net income interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization and then add back to consolidated net income all unusual or nonrecurring items reducing consolidated net income of which only up to million in a year may be cash expenditures  any losses from discontinued operations and closed locations  costs and expenses  including legal fees and expert witness fees  incurred with respect to litigation associated with stockholder derivative litigation  including the matters related to ernst young llp and richard scrushy discussed in note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and share based compensation expense 
we also subtract from consolidated net income all unusual or nonrecurring items to the extent increasing consolidated net income 
under the credit agreement  the adjusted ebitda calculation does not include net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and includes gain or loss on disposal of assets  professional fees unrelated to the stockholder derivative litigation  and unusual or nonrecurring cash expenditures in excess of million 
these items may not be indicative of our ongoing performance  so the adjusted ebitda calculation presented here includes adjustments for them 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  and the items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
therefore  adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our adjusted ebitda for the years ended december    and was as follows in millions reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  net income income from discontinued operations  net of tax  attributable to healthsouth provision for income tax expense benefit loss on interest rate swaps interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees loss on early extinguishment of debt professional fees accounting  tax  and legal government  class action  and related settlements net noncash loss on disposal or impairment of assets depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense net income attributable to noncontrolling interests gain on consolidation of st

as of december   we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
as of december   we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
see note  derivative instruments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on historical experience  current trends  and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates  and judgments to ensure our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize net patient service revenue in the reporting period in which we perform the service based on our current billing rates ie  gross charges less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  net operating revenues  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
our patient accounting system calculates contractual allowances on a patient by patient basis based on the rates in effect for each primary third party payor 
other factors that are considered and could further influence the level of our reserves include the patient s total length of stay for in house patients  each patient s discharge destination  the proportion of patients with secondary insurance coverage and the level of reimbursement under that secondary coverage  and the amount of charges that will be disallowed by payors 
such additional factors are assumed to remain consistent with the experience for patients discharged in similar time periods for the same payor classes  and additional reserves are provided to account for these factors 
management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms that result from contract renegotiations and renewals 
in addition  laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
due to complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  which are often subject to interpretation  we may receive reimbursement for healthcare services authorized and provided that is different from our estimates  and such differences could be material 
however  we continually review the amounts actually collected in subsequent periods in order to determine the amounts by which our estimates differed 
historically  such differences have not been material from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collection of outstanding receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
we provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts  and note  accounts receivable  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our policies related to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement  but patient responsibility amounts deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
changes in general economic conditions such as increased unemployment rates or periods of recession  business office operations  payor mix  or trends in federal or state governmental and private employer healthcare coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  our historical collection experience for each type of payor  and other relevant factors so that the remaining receivables  net of allowances  are reflected at their estimated net realizable values 

table of contents in addition  we have experienced denials of certain diagnosis codes by medicare contractors based on medical necessity 
we dispute  or appeal  most of these denials  and we collect approximately of all amounts denied 
because we do not write off receivables until all collection efforts have been exhausted  we do not write off receivables related to denied claims while they are in this review process 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
as of december  and  million and million  or and  respectively  of our patient accounts receivable represented denials by medicare contractors that were in the medical necessity review process 
during the years ended december    and  we wrote off million  million  and million  respectively  of previously denied claims while we collected million  million  and million  respectively  of previously denied claims 
the table below shows a summary of our net accounts receivable balances as of december  and information on the concentration of total patient accounts receivable by payor class can be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies  accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december  in millions days days days days days patients accounts receivable  net other accounts receivable accounts receivable  net self insured risks we are self insured for certain losses related to professional liability  general liability  and workers compensation risks 
although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims  a substantial portion of our professional liability  general liability  and workers compensation risks are insured through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
see note  self insured risks  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our self insured risks 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our reserves and provisions for professional liability  general liability  and workers compensation risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates calculated by third party actuaries 
the actuaries consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  exposure data  loss development  and geography 
periodically  we review the assumptions and the valuations provided by third party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
the time period to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claims are settled or litigated 
the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed management s estimates 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
goodwill absent any impairment indicators  we evaluate goodwill for impairment as of october st of each year 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our single reporting unit 
we assess qualitative factors in our single reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two step 
table of contents quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the quantitative impairment test is required only if we conclude it is more likely than not our reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
if  based on our qualitative assessment  we were to believe we must proceed to step  we would determine the fair value of our reporting unit using generally accepted valuation techniques including the income approach and the market approach 
we would validate our estimates under the income approach by reconciling the estimated fair value of our reporting unit determined under the income approach to our market capitalization and estimated fair value determined under the market approach 
values from the income approach and market approach would then be evaluated and weighted to arrive at the estimated aggregate fair value of the reporting unit 
the income approach includes the use of our reporting unit s projected operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions 
the projected operating results use management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the forecasted period including assumptions for pricing and volume  operating expenses  and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include cost saving synergies and tax benefits that would accrue to a market participant under a fair value methodology 
the market approach estimates fair value through the use of observable inputs  including the company s stock price 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  goodwill and other intangibles  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the following events and circumstances are certain of the qualitative factors we consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount macroeconomic conditions  such as deterioration in general economic conditions  limitations on accessing capital  or other developments in equity and credit markets  industry and market considerations and changes in healthcare regulations  including reimbursement and compliance requirements under the medicare and medicaid programs  cost factors  such as an increase in labor  supply  or other costs  overall financial performance  such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue or earnings  other relevant company specific events  such as material changes in management or key personnel or outstanding litigation  material events  such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of our reporting unit s net assets  including acquisitions and dispositions  and consideration of the relationship of our market capitalization to our book value  as well as a sustained decrease in our share price 
in the fourth quarter of  we assessed the qualitative factors described above for our reporting unit and concluded it is more likely than not the fair value of our reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
as a result of this assessment of qualitative factors  we determined it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test on our reporting unit 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to goodwill impairment charges 
however  at this time  we continue to believe our reporting unit is not at risk for any impairment charges 
income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we also evaluate our tax positions and establish assets and liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  income taxes  and note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of income taxes and our policies related to income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income we will ultimately generate in the future  as well as other factors 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine the extent a valuation allowance should be provided against deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
our operating performance in recent years  the scheduled reversal of temporary differences  our forecast of taxable income in future periods in each applicable tax jurisdiction  our ability to sustain a core level of earnings  and the availability of prudent tax planning strategies are important considerations in our assessment 
our forecast of future earnings includes assumptions about patient volumes  payor reimbursement  labor costs  hospital operating expenses  and interest expense 
based on the weight of available evidence  we determine if it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions which are periodically audited by tax authorities 
in addition  our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in tax law  the tax jurisdictions in which we operate  and the results of income tax audits 
during the year ended december   we decreased our valuation allowance by million 
as of december   we had a remaining valuation allowance of million which primarily related to state nols 
at the state jurisdiction level  we determined it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize a portion of the deferred tax assets before they expire 
the amount of the valuation allowance has been determined for each tax jurisdiction based on the weight of all available evidence  as described above  including management s estimates of taxable income for each jurisdiction in which we operate over the periods in which the related deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
while management believes the assumptions included in its forecast of future earnings are reasonable and it is more likely than not the net deferred tax asset balance as of december  will be realized  no such assurances can be provided 
if management s expectations for future operating results on a consolidated basis or at the state jurisdiction level vary from actual results due to changes in healthcare regulations  general economic conditions  or other factors  we may need to increase our valuation allowance  or reverse amounts recorded currently in the valuation allowance  for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
similarly  future adjustments to our valuation allowance may be necessary if the timing of future tax deductions is different than currently expected 
our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowance in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
we continue to actively pursue  through ongoing discussions with taxing authorities  the maximization of our income tax benefits  primarily related to our federal nol 
although management believes its estimates and judgments related to these claims are reasonable  depending on the ultimate resolution of these tax matters  actual amounts recovered could differ from management s estimates  and such differences could be material 
see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our participation in the pre filing agreement process with the irs 
assessment of loss contingencies we have legal and other contingencies that could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  litigation reserves  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have provided for losses in situations where we have concluded it is probable a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in determining the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial statement impact of such events 
if further developments or resolution of a contingent matter are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period related to an existing contingent matter 
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
we use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on these items 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates impacts the net fair value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest expense or cash flows 
interest rate changes on variable rate debt impact our interest expense and cash flows  but do not impact the net fair value of the underlying debt instruments 
our fixed and variable rate debt excluding capital lease obligations and other notes payable as of december  is shown in the following table in millions as of december  carrying amount of total estimated fair value of total fixed rate debt variable rate debt total long term debt as of december   our revolving credit facility is the only piece of our long term debt that carries a variable interest rate 
as discussed in note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in september  we completed a public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we used million of the net proceeds from this transaction to repay the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
therefore  as of december   no variable rate debt was outstanding 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the estimated net fair value of our fixed rate debt  and a decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate million increase in its estimated net fair value 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies  are currently  and have been  insignificant to our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows
