item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item  included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion also contains forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview we are an automated global electronic market maker and broker specializing in routing orders and executing and processing trades in securities  futures and foreign exchange instruments on more than electronic exchanges and trading venues around the world 
since our inception in  we have focused on developing proprietary software to automate broker dealer functions 
the advent of electronic exchanges in the last years has provided us with the opportunity to integrate our software with an increasing number of exchanges and trading venues into one automatically functioning  computerized platform that requires minimal human intervention 
in connection with our ipo priced on may   ibg  inc purchased of the membership interests in ibg llc  became the sole managing member of ibg llc and began to consolidate ibg llc financial results into its financial statements 
overview of recapitalization transactions and our organizational structure prior to the ipo  we had historically conducted our business through a limited liability company structure 
our primary assets are our ownership of approximately of the membership interests of ibg llc  the current holding company for our businesses  and our controlling interest and related contractual rights as the sole managing member of ibg llc 
the remaining approximately of ibg llc membership interests are held by holdings  a holding company that is owned by our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  thomas peterffy  and his affiliates  management and other employees of ibg llc  and certain other members 
the ibg llc membership interests held by holdings will be subject to purchase by us over time in connection with offerings by us of shares of our common stock 
purchases of ibg llc membership interests  held by holdings  by the company are governed by the exchange agreement  a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and filed with the sec on november  the exchange agreement  as amended june   provides that the company may facilitate the redemption by holdings of interests held by its members through the issuance of shares of common stock through a public offering in exchange for the interests in ibg llc being redeemed by holdings

as part of a redeployment of the company capital to its shareholders  the company affected a series of dividend payments  including a dividend of per share  which was paid to the company common shareholders in december in december  the company declared and paid a special dividend of per share to its common shareholders 
during the second quarter of  the company declared and paid a cash dividend of per share and has continued this quarterly dividend policy through the current fiscal year end 
we expect to pay a quarterly dividend of per share to our common stockholders for the foreseeable future 
business segments the company reports its results in two business segments  electronic brokerage and market making 
these segments are analyzed separately as we derive our revenues from these two principal business activities as well as allocate resources and assess performance 
electronic brokerage 
we conduct our electronic brokerage business through our ib subsidiaries 
as an electronic broker  we execute  clear and settle trades globally for both institutional and individual customers 
capitalizing on the technology originally developed for our market making business  ib systems provide our customers with the capability to monitor multiple markets around the world simultaneously and to execute trades electronically in these markets at a low cost  in multiple products and currencies from a single trading account 
we offer our customers access to all classes of tradable  primarily exchange listed products  including stocks  bonds  options  futures  forex and mutual funds traded on more than exchanges and market centers and in countries around the world seamlessly 
market making 
we conduct our market making business through our th subsidiaries 
as one of the largest market makers on many of the world leading exchanges  we provide liquidity by offering competitively tight bid offer spreads over a broad base of over  tradable  exchange listed products 
as principal  we commit our own capital and derive revenues or incur losses from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold 
because we provide continuous bid and offer quotations and we are continuously both buying and selling quoted securities  we may have either a long or a short position in a particular product at a given point in time 
our entire portfolio is evaluated each second and continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day  thus minimizing the risk of our portfolio at all times 
this real time rebalancing of our portfolio  together with our real time proprietary risk management system  enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up market and down market scenarios 
business environment throughout  investors endured an extended period of uncertainty as they awaited key economic and political events to play out  including the continuation of talks to resolve the euro zone debt crisis  the us presidential election and the looming fiscal cliff 
several high profile trading glitches contributed to rising investor skepticism about market stability 
waning confidence by market participants likely contributed to falling exchange traded volumes and volatility levels throughout the year as investors were unsure where to invest and kept high levels of cash 
these market conditions 
table of contents dampened our results in both the electronic brokerage and market making segments  which rely on growing investor participation  trading volumes and higher volatility levels 
while our customer trading levels decreased in conjunction with these adverse market conditions  the decline was not as pronounced as that of the overall industry 
our daily average revenue trades by cleared customers declined from the prior year  compared to a decline in global trading volumes of exchange listed equity based options and a decline in us trading volumes  according to data obtained from exchanges worldwide 
despite the decrease in customer activity  we continued to see strong account growth as our reputation for being the broker of choice amongst professional traders continued to spread  by word of mouth  through advertising and in favorable third party reviews 
our customer accounts grew by in  which exceeded the annual growth rate of the larger electronic brokers 
this growth was predominantly in institutional accounts 
financial advisors  hedge and mutual funds  and proprietary trading firms were our fastest growing customer segments 
we are benefiting from the surge in independent advisors  who are leaving traditional brokerage firms and require sophisticated trade allocation technology  to manage complex portfolio strategies across several separately managed accounts 
we have also developed a niche by offering prime brokerage services to hedge funds that are too small to be serviced well by the larger investment banks 
the following is a summary of the key profit drivers that affect our business and how they compared to the prior year global trading volumes 
according to data received from exchanges worldwide  volumes in exchange listed equity based options decreased by approximately globally and in the us for the year ended december   as compared to during we accounted for approximately of the exchange listed equity based options including options on etfs and stock index products volume traded worldwide and approximately of exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us it is important to note that this metric is not directly correlated with our profits 
see the tables on pages of this annual report on form k for additional details regarding our trade volumes  contract and share volumes and brokerage statistics 
volatility 
our market making profits are generally correlated with market volatility since we typically maintain an overall long volatility position  which protects us against a severe market dislocation in either direction 
based on the chicago board options exchange volatility index vix  the average volatility level fell to historic lows  averaging in  lower than it was during  while the vix spent days above in  it never reached this level in the ratio of actual to implied volatility is also meaningful to our results 
because the cost of hedging our positions is based on implied volatility  while our trading profits are  in part  based on actual market volatility  a higher ratio is generally favorable and a lower ratio generally has a negative effect on our trading gains 
this ratio averaged approximately during  about lower than it was in bid offer spreads 
bid offer spreads on us exchange traded options widened only slightly in as reported by the nasdaq omx phlx market  bid offer spreads in were approximately wider than in we believe this increase can be attributed to the heightened scrutiny over high frequency trading firms hft that began after the may flash crash 
regulators and exchanges have since been enacting rules that eliminate some of the advantages hfts had over registered market makers and have increased oversight of these firms 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act has also imposed stricter reporting and disclosure requirements on the hedge fund industry 
yet persistently low volatility levels have help keep spreads relatively tight 

table of contents currency fluctuations 
as a global market maker trading on exchanges around the world in multiple currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we actively manage this exposure by keeping our net worth in proportion to a defined basket of currencies we call the global in order to diversify our risk and to align our hedging strategy with the currencies that we use in our business 
because we report our financial results in us dollars  the change in the value of the global to the us dollar affects our earnings 
the value of the global  as measured in us dollars  at december  declined compared to its value at december  this had a relatively small negative impact on our comprehensive earnings 
financial overview diluted earnings per share were for year ended december  the calculation of diluted earnings per share is detailed in note  to the audited consolidated financial statements  in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december  on a comprehensive basis  which includes the effect of changes in the us dollar value of the company us subsidiaries  diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   inclusive of the effect of reversing deferred taxes on other comprehensive income provided in error in prior years

our results in any given period may be materially affected by volumes in the global financial markets  the level of competition and other factors 
electronic brokerage is more predictable  but it is dependent on customer activity  growth in customer accounts and assets  interest rates and other factors

income before income taxes of each of our business segments and our total income before income taxes are summarized below year ended december  in millions electronic brokerage market making corporate total corporate includes corporate related activities as well as inter segment eliminations 
revenue trading gains trading gains are generated in the normal course of market making 
trading revenues are  in general  proportional to the trading activity in the markets 
our revenue base is highly diversified and comprised of millions of relatively small individual trades of various financial products traded on electronic exchanges  primarily in stocks  options and futures 
trading gains accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trading gains include a portion of translation gains and losses stemming from the basket of foreign currencies we call the global  which we employ to carry out our currency exposure strategy 
a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
trading gains also include revenues from net dividends 
market making activities require us to hold a substantial inventory of equity securities 
we derive significant revenues in the form of dividend income from these equity securities 
this dividend income is largely offset by dividend expense incurred when we make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is 
table of contents generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase the stock after the dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading gains and our net interest income from the market making segment are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
our trading gains are geographically diversified 
in  and  we generated  and  respectively  of our trading gains from operations conducted internationally 
commissions and execution fees we earn commissions and execution fees from our cleared customers for whom we act as executing and clearing brokers and from our non cleared customers for whom we act as an execution only broker 
we have a commission structure that allows customers to choose between an all inclusive bundled rate or an unbundled rate that has lower commissions for high volume customers 
for unbundled commissions  we charge regulatory and exchange fees  at our cost  separately from our commissions  adding transparency to our fee structure 
commissions and execution fees accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commissions and execution fees are geographically diversified 
in  and we generated  and  respectively  of commissions and execution fees from operations conducted internationally 
interest income and interest expense we earn interest on customer funds segregated in safekeeping accounts  on customer borrowings on margin  secured by marketable securities these customers hold with us  from our investment in government treasury securities  from borrowing securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on bank balances 
interest income accounted for  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income is partially offset by interest expense 
we pay interest on cash balances customers hold with us  for cash received from lending securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on our borrowings 
during we discontinued our senior notes program  which resulted in a reduction in our senior notes outstanding by million and a reduction in interest expense on our senior notes of million  as compared to the prior year 
interest expense was  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have automated and integrated our securities lending system with our trading system 
as a result  we have been able to tailor our securities lending activity to produce more optimal results when taken together with trading gains see description under trading gains above 
our net interest income accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents other income other income consists primarily of market data fee income  payment for order flow income  minimum activity fee income from customers and mark to market gains or losses on non market making securities primarily strategic investments 
our other income accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs and expenses execution and clearing expenses our largest single expense category is execution and clearing expenses  which includes the costs of executing and clearing our market making and electronic brokerage trades  as well as other direct expenses  including payment for order flow  regulatory fees and market data fees 
execution fees are paid primarily to electronic exchanges and market centers on which we trade 
clearing fees are paid to clearing houses and clearing agents 
payments for order flow are made as part of exchange mandated programs and to otherwise attract order volume to our system 
market data fees are fees that we must pay to third parties to receive streaming price quotes and related information 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits includes salaries  bonuses and other incentive compensation plans  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs and other related employee costs 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization occupancy expense consists primarily of rental payments on office and data center leases and related occupancy costs  such as utilities 
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets such as computing and communications hardware as well as amortization of leasehold improvements and capitalized in house software development 
communications communications expense consists primarily of the cost of voice and data telecommunications lines supporting our business including connectivity to exchanges around the world 
general and administrative expenses in this category are primarily incurred for professional services  such as legal and audit work  and other operating expenses such as advertising and exchange membership lease expenses 
income tax expense we pay us federal  state and local income taxes on our taxable income  which is proportional to the percentage of ibg llc owned by ibg  inc our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the respective jurisdictions in which they operate 
noncontrolling interest we are the sole managing member of ibg llc and  as such  operate and control all of the business and affairs of ibg llc and its subsidiaries and consolidate ibg llc financial results into our financial statements 
we hold approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
holdings is owned by the original members of ibg llc and holds approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
we reflect holdings ownership as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statement of 
table of contents financial condition  consolidated statement of comprehensive income  consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows 
our share of ibg llc net income  excluding holdings noncontrolling interest  is approximately and similarly  outstanding shares of our common stock represent approximately of the outstanding membership interests of ibg llc 
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
over the past several years  the effects of market structure changes  competition in particular  from hfts and market conditions have  during certain periods  exerted downward pressure on bid offer spreads realized by market makers 
retail broker dealer participation in the equity markets has fluctuated over the past few years due to investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors 
retail transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 
in recent years  in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations  which may allow them to compete more effectively with us 
scrutiny of equity and option market makers  hedge funds and soft dollar practices by regulatory and legislative authorities has increased 
new legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future 
additional consolidation among market centers may adversely affect the value of our smart routing software 
a driver of our market making profits is the relationship between actual and implied volatility in the equities markets 
the cost of maintaining our conservative risk profile is based on implied volatility  while our profitability  in part  is based on actual volatility 
hence  our profitability is increased when actual volatility runs above implied volatility and it is decreased when actual volatility falls below implied volatility 
implied volatility tends to lag actual volatility 
see risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
non gaap financial measures non gaap measures are used to isolate items that the company management views as non operating in nature  which is intended to give a clearer presentation of operating results 
given its material impact on our reported financial results  the following non gaap measure is presented for in december  we effected a series of dividend payments  culminating in a cash dividend of per share  which was paid to holders of ibkr common stock 
in total  ibg llc paid out about billion 
funding for this dividend originated with our swiss company  which paid a dividend to ibg llc  its parent company 
ibg llc  in turn  paid a dividend to its members  including interactive brokers group  inc  the public company 
on a consolidated reporting basis  these dividends had no effect on the company reported income 
however  the original dividend from the swiss company was made from earnings that were not previously taxed in the us as a result  this triggered a us federal income tax liability for the company  which is reported as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
this income tax liability was funded by reserving a portion of the 
table of contents dividend that the company received 
the remaining after tax amount was paid to the company common stockholders 
the result was cash flow neutral for the public company 
at december   approximately million of accumulated earnings that have not been previously subject to income tax in the us were held in the company us subsidiaries 
additional dividends originating from these subsidiaries up to this amount as adjusted over time would be subject to us income tax  as described above 
dividends paid from the remaining equity capital would not be subject to additional income tax 
the company also decided to pay a dividend equivalent to employees holding unvested shares in our stock incentive plan 
this amounted to approximately million and was recorded as compensation expense 
in summary  this item reduced diluted eps by approximately for the year 
the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust this non operating item in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in order to achieve a proper representation of the company financial performance

the decrease in trading gains was a result of a more challenging market making environment  which featured lower volatility and lower exchange traded volumes than during the prior year 
in addition  trading gains were impacted by a million unfavorable swing in currency translation 
consistent with the overall decrease in trading volumes  commissions and execution fees declined due to lower stock  options and futures volumes from customers 
a reduction in interest expense on our senior notes and higher net fees earned from securities borrowed and loaned transactions contributed to an increase in net interest income 
trading volume is an important driver of revenues and costs for both our electronic brokerage and market making segments 
during  options and futures contracts and stock shares executed by our subsidiaries decreased by  and  respectively 
trading gains 
overall trading gains for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  as market makers  we provide liquidity by buying from sellers and selling to buyers 
during the year ended december   our market making operations executed million trades  a decrease of 
table of contents as compared to the number of trades executed in the year ended december  the decrease in trading gains was driven  in part  by a swing in currency translation gains  which contributed of the drop  a million loss in compared to an million gain in as part of managing our overall exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we maintain our capital in a basket of currencies we call the global 
a substantial portion of the currency translation effects may result from the holding of our equity in globals 
a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
trading gains were negatively impacted by a decrease in average volatility  as measured by the vix  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the average ratio of actual to implied volatility decreased from in compared to during the prior year 
in addition  diminishing market participation by retail investors made the trading environment more difficult than that of the prior year 
acting to offset these factors  bid offer spreads on us exchange traded options  as reported by the nasdaq omx phlx market  were approximately wider during the year ended december  than in the prior year 
as a result  our trading gains  after removing the effects of currency translation  decreased by from the year ago period 
included in trading gains are net dividends 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase stock after the ex dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes  reflecting the value of dividends paid to shareholders  must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
commissions and execution fees 
commissions and execution fees for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was driven by lower overall trade volume from our customers  where volumes in options and futures contracts and stock shares decreased by   and  respectively  for the year ended december  from the prior year 
during the second half of we observed a surge in volumes driven by concerns over the us debt downgrade and the european debt crisis 
total darts for cleared and execution only customers for the year ended december  decreased to approximately  as compared to approximately  during the year ended december  darts for cleared customers  ie  customers for whom we execute trades as well as clear and carry positions  decreased to approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the number of customer accounts grew by to approximately  at december   as compared to approximately  at december  average commission per dart for cleared customers  for the year ended december   decreased by to  compared to for the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
net interest income interest income less interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was driven primarily by a reduction in interest expense on our senior notes  higher net fees earned from securities borrowed and loaned transactions and higher customer cash and margin balances 
interest expense on our senior notes decreased by million compared to the year ago quarter as we discontinued our senior notes program in june average customer cash balances increased by  to billion  and average customer fully secured margin borrowings increased  to billion  for the year ended december   as compared to billion and billion  respectively  for the year ended december  
table of contents interest expense on customer cash balances decreased for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  as lower benchmark rates on foreign currency balances more than offset higher balances in those currencies 
given the low benchmark interest rates  we did not pay interest on customer balances denominated in us dollars in interest income from fully secured margin borrowings increased approximately million as higher us dollar borrowings and a higher average fed funds effective rate more than offset interest rate compression in certain foreign currencies 
the average fed funds effective rate increased basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  we earn fees on securities loaned and borrowed to support customer long and short stock holdings in margin accounts 
in addition  our stock yield enhancement program provides an opportunity for customers with fully paid stock to allow ib to lend it out 
in exchange for lending out their stock  our customers receive of the stock loan fees 
ib places cash collateral securing the loans in the customer account 
in the market making segment  as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading income and our net interest income are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
average securities borrowed decreased by  to billion  and average securities loaned increased by  to billion  for the year ended december  net interest earned from securities borrowed and loaned is also affected by the level of demand for securities positions held by our market making companies and by our customers 
during the year ended december   net fees earned by our brokerage and market making segments from securities borrowed and loaned transactions increased million compared to the year ended december  other income 
other income  for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the primary revenue components of other income are market data fees collected from customers  order flow fees paid by us options exchanges and minimum activity fees from customers 
the increase in other income was driven by a million decrease in mark to market losses on non market making securities 
during the fourth quarter of we revalued at zero our equity investment in mf global following its bankruptcy filing 
our decrease in mark to market losses was partially offset by a million decrease in order flow income  compared to the prior year 
non interest expenses non interest expenses  for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million from million  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower execution and clearing expenses and general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  non interest expenses increased to for the year ended december  from during the year ended december  execution and clearing 
execution and clearing expenses  for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december   as a result of lower trading volume in options futures and stocks product classes 
during  options and futures contracts and stock shares executed by our subsidiaries decreased by  and  respectively 

table of contents employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expenses  for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in employee compensation was largely a result of a special discretionary grant of million of restricted stock units awarded on january  the special award was made to provide our employees with greater equity participation in the company and was designed to give lower compensated employees a proportionally higher award 
this increase also reflects the growth in the average number of employees to for the year ended december   as compared to for the prior year 
as we continue to grow  our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff 
as a percentage of total net revenues  employee compensation and benefits expenses were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december   decreased million  or to million  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was due to an million decrease in bad debt expenses and a million decrease in other administrative fees compared to the prior year 
income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to income tax expense for the year ended december   while income before taxes decreased by million  or  during the same period

year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues total net revenues for the year ended december  increased million or  to  million from million during the year ended december  trading volume is an important driver of revenues and costs for both our market making and electronic brokerage segments 
during  options and futures contracts executed by our operating companies increased by and  respectively  while stock shares volume decreased 
brokerage options and futures contract volumes increased and  respectively  market making options and futures contract volumes increased and  respectively  while brokerage stock share volume increased and market making stock share volume decreased 
in brokerage  although stock volume for the year was stable  we observed decreases primarily in low priced stocks after we raised risk margin requirements  to better protect against sudden price moves  on companies with small market capitalization 
in market making  decreases in stock volume resulted from targeted paring back of activity at certain exchanges to improve profitability and avoid high fees 
increased customer cash and margin balances contributed to an increase of million in net interest income in our brokerage segment

a large portion of the currency translation effects result from the holding of our equity in globals 
a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
included in trading gains are net dividends 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase stock after the ex dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes  reflecting the value of dividends paid to shareholders  must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
commissions and execution fees 
commissions and execution fees for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was driven by higher overall trade volume from our customers

as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading income and our net interest income are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
net interest income increased million as loan balances with ibg llc were reduced and the rates paid on those loans were lower than in the prior year 
in addition  net interest income from operating cash accounts increased million 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in net interest earned from securities borrowed and loaned

of our translation gains  million was attributable to an increase in the value of a million tax credit receivable denominated in swiss francs and million was a result of increases in gains from foreign currency forward positions compared the prior year 
our losses were further offset by a million increase in market data and minimum activity fees compared to the prior year

at december   total assets were billion of which approximately billion  or were considered liquid 

table of contents daily monitoring of liquidity needs and available collateral levels is undertaken to help ensure that an appropriate liquidity cushion  in the form of unpledged collateral  is maintained at all times 
our ability to quickly reduce funding needs by balance sheet contraction without adversely affecting our core businesses and to pledge additional collateral in support of secured borrowings is continuously evaluated to ascertain the adequacy of our capital base 
we actively manage our excess liquidity and we maintain significant borrowing facilities through the securities lending markets and with banks

these expenditure items are reported as property and equipment 
capital expenditures for property and equipment were approximately  and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our gross capital expenditures will be lower than in as we complete the expansion of our data center and backup facilities 
in the future  we plan meet capital expenditure needs as we continue our focus on technology infrastructure initiatives to further enhance our competitive position 
we anticipate that we will fund capital expenditures with cash from operations and cash on hand 
in response to changing economic conditions  we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them either upward or downward to match our actual performance 
if we pursue any strategic acquisitions  we may incur additional capital expenditures

seasonality our businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations  reflecting varying numbers of market participants at times during the year and varying numbers of trading days from quarter to quarter  including declines in trading activity due to holidays 
typical seasonal trends may be superseded by market or world events  which can have a significant impact on prices and trading volume 

table of contents inflation although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we believe that inflation has not had for the three most recent years  and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on our results of operations 
strategic investments and acquisitions we periodically engage in evaluations of potential strategic investments and acquisitions 
the company holds strategic investments in electronic trading exchanges including boston options exchange  llc  onechicago llc and cboe stock exchange  llc 
the company has also made investments in quadriserv inc  an electronic securities lending platform provider and factor advisors  llc  an exchange traded funds etf issuer 
we intend to continue making acquisitions on an opportunistic basis  generally only when the acquisition candidate will  in our opinion  enable us to acquire either technology or customers faster than we could develop them on our own 
at december   there were no definitive agreements with respect to any material acquisition 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements ibg  inc may be exposed to a risk of loss not reflected in the consolidated financial statements for futures products  which represent obligations of the company to settle at contracted prices  which may require repurchase or sale in the market at prevailing prices 
accordingly  these transactions result in off balance sheet risk as ibg  inc cost to liquidate such futures contracts may exceed the amounts reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
critical accounting policies valuation of financial instruments due to the nature of our operations  substantially all of our financial instrument assets  comprised of financial instruments owned  securities purchased under agreements to resell  securities borrowed and receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are carried at fair value based on published market prices and are marked to market daily  or are assets which are short term in nature such as u 
s 
government treasury bills or spot foreign exchange and are reflected at amounts approximating fair value 
similarly  all of our financial instrument liabilities that arise from financial instruments sold but not yet purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  securities loaned and payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are short term in nature and are reported at quoted market prices or at amounts approximating fair value 
our long and short positions are valued at either the last consolidated trade price or the last consolidated bid offer mid point where applicable at the close of regular trading hours  in their respective markets 
given that we manage a globally integrated market making portfolio  we have large and substantially offsetting positions in securities and commodities that trade on different exchanges that close at different times of the trading day 
as a result  there may be large and anomalous swings in the value of our positions daily and  accordingly  in our earnings in any period 
this is especially true on the last business day of each calendar quarter  although such swings tend to come back into equilibrium on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter 
principles of consolidation  including noncontrolling interests the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ibg  inc and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries 
as sole managing member of ibg llc  ibg  inc exerts control over the group operations 
in accordance with asc  consolidation  the company consolidates the group 
table of contents consolidated financial statements and records as noncontrolling interest the interests in the group that ibg  inc does not own 
we are the sole managing member of ibg llc and  as such  operate and control all of the business and affairs of ibg llc and its subsidiaries and consolidate ibg llc financial results into our financial statements 
we hold approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
holdings is owned by the original members of ibg llc and holds approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
our share of ibg llc net income  excluding holdings noncontrolling interest  is approximately and similarly  outstanding shares of our common stock represent approximately of the outstanding membership interests of ibg llc 
prior to the june  amendment to the exchange agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements  the company was required to report holdings ownership as redeemable noncontrolling interests ie  temporary equity pursuant to asc  asc and asc s a formerly fasb emerging issues task force topic d  outside of total equity in the consolidated financial statements 
redemption value of these redeemable noncontrolling interests was measured as the number of equivalent shares of member interests in ibg llc owned by holdings multiplied by the then current market price per share of the company common stock 
the excess of the redemption value over the book value of these interests  which did not affect net income attributable to common stockholders or cash flows  was required to be accounted for as a reduction of the company stockholders equity in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the company elected to recognize changes in redemption value in each reporting period immediately as they occurred as if the end of each reporting period was also the redemption date for the entire redeemable noncontrolling interest under paragraph b of asc s a  notwithstanding that the redeemable noncontrolling interests are redeemable over a period of time pursuant to a redemption schedule see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for periods after the amendment  the noncontrolling interests in ibg llc attributable to holdings will be reported as a component of total equity 
earnings per share earnings per share eps are computed in accordance with asc  earnings per share 
shares of class a and class b common stock share proportionately in the earnings of ibg  inc basic earnings per share are calculated utilizing net income available for common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding for that period 
diluted earnings per share are calculated utilizing the company basic net income available for common stockholders divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding with no adjustments to net income available to common stockholders for dilutive potential common shares 
the company has determined to reflect topic d measurement adjustments for non fair value redemption rights through application of the two class method of calculating earnings per share in lieu of recognizing the impact through the determination of net income attributable to common shareholders 
furthermore  in accordance with footnote of asc s a  the company has elected to treat only the portion of the periodic measurement adjustments that reflect a redemption in excess of fair value as being akin to a dividend  reducing net income attributable to common stockholders for purposes of applying the two class method 
decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests through topic d measurement adjustments are reflected in the application of the two class method only to the extent they represent recoveries of amounts previously accounted for by applying the two class method 

table of contents stock based compensation ibg  inc follows asc  compensation stock compensation  to account for its stock based compensation plans 
asc requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
as a result  ibg  inc expenses the fair value of awards granted to employees  generally in the year of grant in recognition of plan forfeiture provisions described below and the remaining over the related vesting period utilizing the graded vesting method permitted under asc in the case of retirement eligible employees those employees older than  of awards are expensed when granted 
awards granted under the stock based compensation plans are subject to forfeiture in the event an employee ceases employment with the company 
the plans provide that employees who discontinue employment with the company without cause and continue to meet the terms of the plans post employment provisions will forfeit of unvested previously granted awards unless the employee is over the age of  in which case the employee would be eligible to receive of unvested awards previously granted 
contingencies our policy is to estimate and accrue for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings  to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with asc  contingencies 
potential losses that might arise out of tax audits  to the extent that such losses are more likely than not  would be estimated and accrued in accordance with asc significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability accrued with respect to litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses based on  among other factors  the progress of each case  our experience with and industry experience with similar cases and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
we have been from time to time subject to certain pending and legal actions which arise out of the normal course of business 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  particularly in proceedings where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages  or which are in their early stages 
we cannot predict with certainty the actual loss or range of loss related to such legal proceedings  the manner in which they will be resolved  the timing of final resolution or the ultimate settlement 
consequently  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses related to such legal matters  even in instances where it is reasonably possible that a future loss will be incurred 
as of december   we  along with certain of our subsidiaries  have been named parties to legal actions  which we and or such subsidiaries intend to defend vigorously 
although the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect  if any  on our business or financial condition  but may have a material impact on the results of operations for a given period 
as of december  and december   reserves provided for potential losses related to litigation matters were not material 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
such 
table of contents estimates include the estimated fair values of ibg llc and the company in connection with accounting for redeemable noncontrolling interests  value of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting  the estimated useful lives of property and equipment  including capitalized internally developed software  the allowance for doubtful accounts  compensation accruals  current and deferred income taxes and estimated contingency reserves 
income taxes ibg  inc accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the company income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits are based on enacted tax laws and reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
determining income tax expense requires significant judgments and estimates 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of the underlying assets and liabilities 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
deferred income taxes have not been provided for us tax liabilities or for additional foreign taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been indefinitely reinvested 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  on the basis of the technical merits 
asc also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the company records tax liabilities in accordance with asc and adjusts these liabilities when management judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available

table of contents standards by us issuers ifrs roadmap 
the statement supported convergence of accounting standards and the development of a single set of global accounting standards

the staff report did not reject some form of convergence between us gaap and ifrs  but also did not endorse adoption and did not commit to the extent or timing of adoption 
while a formal commitment regarding possible incorporation of ifrs into us gaap has not been determined  based on continuing joint efforts between the fasb and iasb  it is likely that convergence to some extent will occur in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
our exposures to market risks arise from assumptions built into our pricing models  equity price risk  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations  changes in interest rates which impact our variable rate debt obligations  and risks relating to the extension of margin credit to our customers 
pricing model exposure our strategy as a market maker is to calculate quotes a few seconds ahead of the market and execute small trades at tiny but favorable differentials as a result 
this is made possible by our proprietary pricing model  which continuously evaluates and monitors the risks inherent in our portfolio  assimilates market data and reevaluates the outstanding quotes in our entire portfolio each second 
certain aspects of the model rely on historical prices of securities 
if the behavior of price movements of individual securities diverges substantially from what their historical behavior would predict  we might incur trading losses 
we attempt to limit such risks by diversifying our portfolio across many different options  futures and underlying securities and avoiding concentrations of positions based on the same underlying security 
historically  our losses from these events have been immaterial in comparison to our annual trading profits 
foreign currency exposure as a result of our international market making activities and accumulated earnings in our foreign subsidiaries  our income and net worth is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our european operations and some of our asian operations are conducted by our swiss subsidiary  the 
the is regulated by the swiss financial market supervisory authority as a securities dealer and its financial statements are presented in swiss francs 
accordingly  the is exposed to certain foreign exchange risks as described below the buys and sells futures contracts and securities denominated in various currencies and carries bank balances and borrows and lends such currencies in its regular course of business 
at the end of each accounting period the assets and liabilities are translated into swiss francs for presentation in its financial statements 
the resulting gains or losses are reported as translation gain or loss in the income statement 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  the swiss franc balances are translated into us dollars for us gaap purposes 
the translation gains or losses appear as such on ibg  inc consolidated statement  of comprehensive income  included in trading gains 
the net worth is carried on the books in swiss francs in accordance with swiss accounting standards 
at the end of each accounting period  the net worth is translated at the then prevailing exchange rate into us dollars and the resulting gain or loss is reported as oci in 
table of contents our consolidated statement of financial condition and consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
to a smaller extent  oci is also produced by our other non us subsidiaries 
historically  we have taken the approach of not hedging the above exposures  based on the notion that the cost of constantly hedging over the years would amount to more than the random impact of rate changes on our non us dollar balances 
for instance  an increase in the value of the swiss franc would be unfavorable to the earnings of the but would be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that the yearly translation gain or loss into us dollars is likely to move in the opposite direction 
since  we have expanded our market making systems to incorporate cash forex and forex options to hedge our currency exposure at little or no cost and to hedge our currency exposure throughout each day on a continuous basis 
in connection with the development of our currency strategy  we determined to base our net worth in globals  a basket of currencies 
periodically  we re evaluate the composition of the global  in we expanded the composition of the global from six to currencies 
the table below shows a comparison of the us dollar equivalent of the global as december  and as of as of currency composition fx rate global in usd equiv 
of comp 
fx rate global in usd equiv 
of comp 
change in of comp 
usd eur jpy gbp cad brl inr chf hkd aud krw mxn sek nok sgd dkk because we actively manage our global currency exposure by maintaining our equity in globals  we consider ourselves a global enterprise based in a diversified basket of currencies rather than a us dollar based company 
the us dollar value of the global decreased from to  or  in at december  approximately of our equity was denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
the effects of our currency strategy appear in two places in the financial statements as a component of trading gains in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income and as oci in the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition 
the full effect of the global is captured in comprehensive income 
reported results on a comprehensive basis reflect the us gaap convention adopted in that requires the reporting of currency translation results contained in oci as part of reportable earnings 
previously  currency translation results were reported only as a component of changes in total equity in the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition 

table of contents interest rate risk we had no variable rate debt outstanding at december  under our senior secured revolving credit facility  we have the ability to choose borrowing tenors from overnight to twelve months  which permits us to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
we pay our electronic brokerage customers interest based on benchmark overnight interest rates in various currencies 
in a normal rate environment  we typically invest a portion of these funds in us government treasury securities with maturities of up to three months 
under these circumstances  if interest rates were to increase rapidly and substantially  in increments that were not reflected in the yields on these treasury securities  our net interest income from customer deposits would decrease 
based upon investments outstanding at december   we had minimal exposure of this nature 
we also face the potential for reduced net interest income from customer deposits due to interest rate spread compression in a low rate environment 
due to a currently low rate environment  a decrease of us benchmark interest rates by  would reduce our net interest income by approximately million on an annualized basis 
we also face substantial interest rate risk due to positions carried in our market making business to the extent that long or short stock positions may have been established for future or forward dates on options or futures contracts and the value of such positions are impacted by interest rates 
we hedge such risks by entering into interest rate futures contracts 
to the extent that these futures positions do not perfectly hedge this interest rate risk  our trading gains may be adversely affected 
the amount of such risk cannot be quantified 
dividend risk we face dividend risk in our market making business as we derive significant revenues and incur significant expenses in the form of dividend income and expense  respectively  from our substantial inventory of equity securities  and must make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
projected future dividends are an important component of pricing equity options and other derivatives  and incorrect projections may lead to trading losses 
the amount of these risks cannot be quantified 
margin credit we extend margin credit to our customers  which is subject to various regulatory requirements 
margin credit is collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
the risks associated with margin credit increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation 
we are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities  that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
we expect this kind of exposure to increase with growth in our overall business 
because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing firms from certain liabilities or claims  the use of margin credit and short sales may expose us to significant off balance sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations 
as of december   we had billion in margin credit extended to our customers 
the amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin credit we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
our account level margin credit requirements meet or exceed those required by regulation t of the 
table of contents board of governors of the federal reserve 
as a matter of practice  we enforce real time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers positions if their equity falls below required margin requirements 
we have a comprehensive policy implemented in accordance with regulatory standards to assess and monitor the suitability of investors to engage in various trading activities 
to mitigate our risk  we also continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration  large orders or positions  patterns of day trading and other activities that indicate increased risk to us 
our credit exposure is to a great extent mitigated by our policy of automatically evaluating each account throughout the trading day and closing out positions automatically for accounts that are found to be under margined 
while this methodology is effective in most situations  it may not be effective in situations where no liquid market exists for the relevant securities or commodities or where  for any reason  automatic liquidation for certain accounts has been disabled
