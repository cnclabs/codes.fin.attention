services revenues services revenues are derived from professional services that include developing  implementing  integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure  and software applications 
most of our projects are performed on a time and materials basis  while a smaller portion of our revenues is derived from projects performed on a fixed fee basis 
fixed fee engagements represented approximately of our services revenues for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for time and material projects  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours our professionals expend in the performance of the project by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using an input method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
amounts invoiced and collected in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
on most projects  we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging  and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our clients  the total number of our projects that require travel  and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
software and hardware revenues software and hardware revenues are derived from sales of third party software and hardware 
revenues from sales of third party software and hardware are generally recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction 
on rare occasions  we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the transaction and act as an agent 
in these cases  revenues are recorded on a net basis 
software and hardware revenues are expected to fluctuate depending on our clients demand for these products 
if we enter into contracts for the sale of services and software or hardware  management evaluates whether each element should be accounted for separately by considering the following criteria whether the deliverables have value to the client on a stand alone basis  and whether delivery or performance of the undelivered item or items is considered probable and substantially in our control only if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to the delivered item 
further  for sales of software and services  management also evaluates whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software and has fair value evidence for each deliverable 
if management concludes that the separation criteria are met  then it accounts for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of our multiple element arrangements meet these criteria and are accounted for separately  with the arrangement consideration allocated among the deliverables using vendor specific objective evidence of the selling price 
as a result  we generally recognize software and hardware sales upon delivery to the customer and services consistent with the policies described herein 
further  delivery of software and hardware sales  when sold contemporaneously with services  can generally occur at varying times depending on the specific client project arrangement 
delivery of services generally occurs over a period of time consistent with the timeline as outlined in the client contract 
there are no significant cancellation or termination type provisions for our software and hardware sales 
contracts for professional services provide for a general right  to the client or us  to cancel or terminate the contract within a given period of time generally to days notice is required 
the client is responsible for any time and expenses incurred up to the date of cancellation or termination of the contract 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of cash and non cash compensation and benefits  including bonuses and non cash compensation related to equity awards 
cost of revenues also includes the costs associated with subcontractors 
third party software and hardware costs  reimbursable expenses and other unreimbursed project related expenses are also included in cost of revenues 
project related expenses will fluctuate generally depending on outside factors including the cost and frequency of travel and the location of our clients 
cost of revenues does not include depreciation of assets used in the production of revenues which are primarily personal computers  servers  and other information technology related equipment 
gross margins our gross margins for services are affected by the utilization rates of our professionals defined as the percentage of our professionals time billed to clients divided by the total available hours in the respective period  the salaries we pay our professionals  and the average billing rate we receive from our clients 
if a project ends earlier than scheduled  we retain professionals in advance of receiving project assignments  or if demand for our services declines  our utilization rate will decline and adversely affect our gross margins 
gross margin percentages of third party software and hardware sales are typically lower than gross margin percentages for services  and the mix of services and software and hardware for a particular period can significantly impact our total combined gross margin percentage for such period 
in addition  gross margin for software and hardware sales can fluctuate due to pricing and other competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are primarily composed of sales related costs  general and administrative salaries  stock compensation expense  recruiting expense  office costs  bad debts  variable compensation costs  and other miscellaneous expenses 
we work to minimize selling costs by focusing on repeat business with existing clients and by accessing sales leads generated by our software vendors  most notably ibm  oracle and microsoft  whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients 
these relationships enable us to reduce our selling costs and sales cycle times and increase win rates through leveraging our partners marketing efforts and endorsements 
plans for growth and acquisitions our goal is to continue to build one of the leading independent information technology consulting firms by expanding our relationships with existing and new clients and through the continuation of our disciplined acquisition strategy 
our future growth plan includes expanding our business with a primary focus on customers in the united states  both organically and through acquisitions 
given the economic conditions during and we suspended acquisition activity pending improved visibility into the health of the economy

the company has no intention of repatriating cash from its chinese operations in the foreseeable future 
we believe that the currently available funds  access to capital from our credit facility  and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and other capital needs for the next months 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  purchase accounting  accounting for stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenues are primarily derived from professional services provided on a time and materials basis 
for time and material contracts  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours expended in the performance of the contract by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using an input method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
amounts invoiced and collected in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
on many projects we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging  and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
revenues from software and hardware sales are generally recorded on a gross basis considering our role as a principal in the transaction 
on rare occasions  we enter into a transaction where we are not the principal 
in these cases  revenue is recorded on a net basis 
unbilled revenues represent the project time and expenses that have been incurred  but not yet billed to the client  prior to the end of the fiscal period 
for time and materials projects  the client is invoiced for the amount of hours worked multiplied by the billing rates as stated in the contract 
for fixed fee arrangements  the client is invoiced according to the agreed upon schedule detailing the amount and timing of payments in the contract 
clients are typically billed monthly for services provided during that month  but can be billed on a more or less frequent basis as determined by the contract 
if the time and expenses are worked incurred and approved at the end of a fiscal period and the invoice has not yet been sent to the client  the amount is recorded as unbilled revenue once we verify all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  delivery and acceptance have occurred  and collectability is deemed probable 
our policy for revenue recognition in instances where multiple deliverables are sold contemporaneously to the same customer is in accordance with accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc subtopic  software revenue recognition  asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  and asc section s staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition 
specifically  if we enter into contracts for the sale of services and software or hardware  then we evaluate whether each element should be accounted for separately by considering the following criteria whether the deliverables have value to the client on a stand alone basis  and whether delivery or performance of the undelivered item or items is considered probable and substantially in our control only if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to the delivered item 
further  for sales of software and services  we also evaluate whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software and we have fair value evidence for each deliverable 
if we have concluded that the separation criteria are met  then we account for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of our multiple element arrangements meet these criteria and are accounted for separately  with the arrangement consideration allocated among the deliverables using vendor specific objective evidence of the selling price 
as a result  we generally recognize software and hardware sales upon delivery to the customer and services consistent with the policies described herein 
further  delivery of software and hardware sales  when sold contemporaneously with services  can generally occur at varying times depending on the specific client project arrangement 
delivery of services generally occurs over a period of time consistent with the timeline as outlined in the client contract 
there are no significant cancellation or termination type provisions for our software and hardware sales 
contracts for professional services provide for a general right  to the client or to us  to cancel or terminate the contract within a given period of time generally to days notice is required 
the client is responsible for any time and expenses incurred up to the date of cancellation or termination of the contract 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and we are required to assess whether one or more units of accounting are present 
service fees are typically accounted for as one unit of accounting  as fair value evidence for individual tasks or milestones is not available 
we follow the guidelines discussed above in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenues recognized in any accounting period 
if estimates are revised  material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenues recognized for a given period 
revenues are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities 
sales taxes are generally collected and subsequently remitted on all software and hardware sales and certain services transactions as appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
each accounting period  accounts receivable is evaluated for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments  historical experience and other currently available information 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue or bad debts as appropriate in the period the risk is identified 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if the evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  future reductions to revenue or bad debt expense may be incurred 
goodwill  other intangible assets  and impairment of long lived assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  or net liabilities assumed  in a business combination 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill as of october each year and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
asc topic permits  but does not require  an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that our fair value is less than our carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if it is more likely than not that our fair value is less than our carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test will be conducted 
the first step screens for impairment and  when impairment is indicated  a second step is employed to measure the impairment 
we elected to go directly to step one rather than making a more likely than not assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors 
our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of october  our fair value as of the annual testing date exceeded our book value and consequently  no impairment was indicated 
our fair value was determined by weighting the results of two valuation methods market capitalization based on the average price of our common stock  including a control premium  for a reasonable period of time prior to the evaluation date generally days and a discounted cash flow model 
the fair value calculated using our average common stock price including a control premium was weighted while the value calculated by the discounted cash flow model was weighted in our determination of our overall fair value 
while the use of our average common stock price  plus a control premium  may be considered the best evidence of fair value in asc topic  we believe the volatility in our stock price  and in the market overall  are not always consistently aligned with our financial results or outlook 
the discounted cash flow approach allows us to calculate our fair value based on operating performance and meaningful financial metrics 
a key assumption used in the calculation of our fair value using our average common stock price was the consideration of a control premium 
we reviewed industry premium data and determined an appropriate control premium for the analysis based on the low end of any premium received in transactions over the past several years 
significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow model included projections of revenue growth  net income margins  discount rate  and terminal business value 
the forecasts of revenue growth and net income margins are based upon our long term view of the business and are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 
the discount rate utilized was estimated using the weighted average cost of capital for our industry 
the terminal business value was determined by applying a growth factor to the latest year for which a forecast exists 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  non compete arrangements  trade name  and internally developed software  which are being amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives range from one to eight years 
amortization of customer relationships  non compete arrangements  trade name  and internally developed software is considered an operating expense and is included in amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a lack of recoverability or revised useful life 
purchase accounting we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
such fair market value assessments require significant judgments and estimates that can change materially as additional information becomes available 
the purchase price is allocated to intangibles based on our estimate and an independent valuation 
we finalize the purchase price allocation within months of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting valuation estimates are finalized 
accounting for stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
restricted stock awards are valued at the price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
income taxes we calculate and provide for income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  measured using enacted tax rates  are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have established liabilities or reduced assets for uncertain tax positions when we believe those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances each quarter 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements our recently adopted accounting pronouncements are fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  except operating lease commitments as disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we generate a portion of our revenues and incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   we were exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  between the us dollar and the chinese yuan  and between the us dollar and the indian rupee 
we have not hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is not significant 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   there was million outstanding and million of available borrowing capacity under our line of credit facility 
our interest expense will fluctuate as the interest rate for the line of credit floats based  at our option  on our lead lender s prime rate plus a margin or the one month libor rate plus a margin 
based on the million outstanding on the line of credit as of december   an increase in the interest rate of basis points would add  of interest expense per year  which is not considered material to our financial position or results of operations 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  and million at december  the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income
