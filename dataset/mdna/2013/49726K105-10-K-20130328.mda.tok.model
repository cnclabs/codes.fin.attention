item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our business and operations  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors  including the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview kips bay medical  inc we  us  our or the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on may  we are a medical device company focused on manufacturing and commercializing our external saphenous vein support technology  or esvs mesh  for use in coronary artery bypass grafting cabg surgery 
our esvs mesh is a nitinol mesh sleeve that  when placed on the outside of a saphenous vein graft during cabg surgery  is designed to improve the structural characteristics and long term performance of the saphenous vein graft 
cabg surgery is one of the most commonly performed cardiac surgeries in the united states 
in cabg procedures  surgeons harvest blood vessels  including the internal mammary artery from the chest wall and the saphenous vein from the leg  and attach the harvested vessels to the heart in order to bypass  or provide blood flow around  blocked coronary arteries 
we believe the use of our esvs mesh with saphenous vein grafts in cabg surgery will improve the long term outcome of cabg procedures  including improved openness  or patency  and improved blood flow characteristics through the saphenous vein graft  resulting in a reduced need for costly and potentially complicated reoperations or revascularization procedures 
we received authorization to apply the ce mark to our esvs mesh in may and we began marketing and commenced shipments in select international markets in june our esvs mesh is a novel product and we are not aware of the establishment of any specific or supplemental reimbursements for our esvs mesh 
given the budgetary pressures in europe  our sales to date have been limited 
we are currently conducting a feasibility trial for the u 
s food and drug administration fda 
this trial is a multi center  randomized study of external saphenous vein support using our esvs mesh in cabg surgery and is titled the emesh i study 
the objective of this study is to demonstrate the initial safety and performance of the esvs mesh for use as an external saphenous vein graft svg support device during cabg surgery 
the company expects to enroll up to patients at eight european and four us sites and further expects to use the data from this study as the basis for the filing of a request for an investigational device exemption ide to perform a larger pivotal study which is required to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and support a request for approval to sell our esvs mesh in the united states 
enrollments in this trial commenced in late august at the bern university hospital  bern  switzerland and in february at the northeast georgia medical center in gainesville  georgia 
the primary safety endpoint is the day rate of mace  defined as the rate of the composite of total mortality  myocardial infarction heart attack  and or coronary target vessel revascularization percutaneous coronary intervention or cabg within days of the procedure 
the esvs mesh performance will be evaluated based upon the angiographic patency rate of the enrolled grafts  where patency is defined as less than stenosis  or blockage  of the svg at six months after surgery 
we are currently working through the internal review and approval process with a number of leading cardiac centers in europe and the united states to expand the total number of research sites to as of march   six sites have received ethics committee approval and are actively recruiting patients for this study 

table of contents on november   we announced that the us fda had approved with conditions our ide to include four us study sites in the emesh i clinical feasibility trial of our esvs mesh 
in its approval  the fda also indicated that it was allowing a staged enrollment within the united states starting with five patients 
in january the fda expanded their approval to allow for patients 
we are required to provide six month follow up angiogram data for five us patients or  alternatively  a combination of patients from inside and outside the united states  for the fda to review 
if the fda determines that these angiograms are acceptable  we expect to receive the approval from the fda to enroll the remaining us patients initially requested by us 
on march   in response to additional information we provided to the fda  the fda notified us that we had satisfactorily addressed the conditions indicated by the fda in the their november  approval noted above 
upon completion of this study  we expect to request an ide for a pivotal study in the us however  we could be delayed by adverse clinical results or regulatory complications  and we may never receive an ide for a pivotal study or us marketing approval 
in december  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
all shares sold in this offering were newly issued by the company 
gross proceeds from this offering were million 
after deducting the underwriting commissions and other expenses  we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
as additional consideration for this transaction  we issued options to purchase  shares of our common stock to the underwriter and its designees 
these options have a five year term  an exercise price of per share or of the purchase price of shares sold in this public offering  and become exercisable on december   one year after the effective date of this public offering 
on january   we issued an additional  shares to the underwriter at a purchase price of per share pursuant to the underwriter partial exercise of its over allotment option from this public offering 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue as we pursue commercialization of and further regulatory approvals for our esvs mesh 
prior to completing our initial public offering ipo in february  we had financed our operations primarily through the private placement of convertible debt and equity securities 
successful completion of our development programs and  ultimately  our ability to generate revenues and attain profitable operations are dependent on future trends or events  including the availability of adequate reimbursement levels in each jurisdiction 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states and other countries and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs will significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  and could result in lower or no reimbursement for our esvs mesh 
if we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement levels in a sufficient number of jurisdictions  our revenues and gross margins will be harmed 
the willingness of qualified distributors to agree to sell our esvs mesh in each of the markets in which we are approved 
we have identified a number of independent distributors to conduct sales in europe  and we have entered into agreements for distribution in switzerland  italy  germany  france  spain  belgium  the netherlands  luxembourg and the united kingdom 
we have also entered into an agreement with an independent distributor to conduct sales in the united arab emirates 
we may not be able to enter into additional distribution agreements on favorable terms or in a timely manner  which may harm our operating results 
our ability to negotiate satisfactory pricing with qualified distributors 
if we are unable to negotiate satisfactory pricing with qualified distributors in connection with their engagement  our revenues and gross margins may be harmed 

table of contents the pace at which we can train sales representatives of qualified distributors 
we believe we have engaged and we intend to further engage distributors that have experienced sales representatives who we expect to be able to train cardiac surgeons on the advantages and features of our esvs mesh in a timely manner 
in addition  our clinical trial experience has shown that training of cardiac surgeons can occur in a short period of time  normally less than two days  but may take longer 
if we are unable to train cardiac surgeons in a timely manner  our operating results may be harmed 
compliance with regulatory requirements for medical devices 
these regulatory requirements are extensive  and we believe they will continue to expand 
we expect a substantial amount of our expenses will be used for compliance with these regulatory requirements  including in connection with conducting clinical trials  regulatory submissions and ongoing compliance 
the level of acceptance of our esvs mesh in the marketplace 
if our esvs mesh is unable to achieve market acceptance  our revenues will be limited 
key components of our results of operations net sales we received ce mark approval in may and began marketing and commenced shipments of our esvs mesh in select european markets in june we sell our esvs mesh to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
the pricing in all distributor agreements is denominated in us dollars and provides for the transfer of title when we ship our esvs mesh to the distributors 
we invoice shipping charges to our distributors and include them in net sales 
we expense shipping costs at the time we report the related revenue and record them in cost of sales 
cost of sales we fabricate our esvs mesh both at our facility and at a contract manufacturer 
we conduct final assembly and packaging at our facility 
our cost of sales consists primarily of purchased components  direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead and royalties payable to medtronic  inc medtronic 
research and development expenses since our inception  we have focused our activities on the development of our esvs mesh 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
research and development costs include the costs to design  develop  test  seek approval for  and enhance our esvs mesh and production processes 
expenses related to research and development consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  product development  preclinical and clinical trials  professional service fees  materials and supplies and facilities related costs 
we expense amounts paid to obtain patents or acquire licenses  as the ultimate recoverability of the amounts paid is uncertain 
while our research and development expenses to date have been focused on product development and evaluating the feasibility of our esvs mesh  we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical trials 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and costs to complete 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product applications or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product applications 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product 
the cost of clinical trials may 
table of contents vary significantly over the life of the trial as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial  including the number of sites included in the clinical trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that participate in the clinical trials  and the duration of patient follow up 
our reported expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple clinical trial sites and by contract research organizations cros which provide support to us in the conduct of the clinical trials 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones  such as number of patients enrolled 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical trial design or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and other costs  including stock based compensation  for our executive and administrative personnel  legal and other professional fees  travel  sales and marketing costs  insurance and other corporate costs 
we have incurred a significant increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a result of becoming a public company in february these increases have included increased costs for insurance  costs related to quarterly  annual and other periodic filings with the sec and payments to outside consultants  lawyers and accountants 
we have also incurred significant costs to comply with the corporate governance  internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies 
milestone expense as consideration for the purchase of the core intellectual property relating to our esvs mesh  we have agreed to pay medtronic an aggregate of up to million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones 
the milestones and related payments consist of million due on the one year anniversary of the first commercial sale of our esvs mesh  million due when our cumulative net sales reach million and million due when our cumulative net sales reach million 
we recorded our first commercial sale in june and accrued an expense for the first milestone obligation at that time 
this milestone was paid in june interest income interest income consists of interest earned on investments in bank certificates of deposits  money market funds  commercial paper and corporate debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described 
table of contents below 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we sell our esvs mesh to international distributors  which subsequently resell it to hospitals and clinics 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and accounting standards codification asc s  specifically  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of goods occurs through the transfer of title and risks and rewards of ownership  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue as products are shipped based on agreements with each of our distributors  which provide that title and risk of loss pass to the distributor upon shipment of the products to the distributor and do not provide the distributors a right of return 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs  including clinical trial costs  when incurred  consistent with the guidance of asc  research and development 
all of our clinical trials are performed at clinical trial sites and certain trials are administered by cros 
we accrue costs for clinical trials based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up clinical trial sites are accrued immediately 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones  such as number of patients enrolled 
all material clinical trial and cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cros and certain non cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination 
stock based compensation stock based incentive awards are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires companies to measure and recognize the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
compensation cost is recognized ratably using the straight line attribution method over the expected vesting period  which is considered to be the requisite service period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating the compensation costs  instead of accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
all of our previously awarded options were classified as equity instruments and continue to maintain their equity classification 
the fair value of options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the assumptions described in the following sentences 
risk free interest rates are based upon us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term 
expected volatility and forfeiture rates are based on the volatility rates of a set of guideline companies  which consist of public and recently public medical technology companies 
the assumed dividend yield is zero  as we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
the expected term is determined using the simplified method 
table of contents allowed by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering in february  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors at each award grant date based upon a variety of factors  primarily the most recent purchase prices of our common stock issued to third parties in arms length transactions  but also the progress of our product development  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  and the risks associated with our business plan 
if we had made different assumptions and estimates  the amount of our recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions in determining the fair market value of our common stock 
we grant options to employees and non employees  including members of our scientific advisory board 
option grants to employees have a maximum term of ten years and generally vest over four years at the rate of of the total shares underlying the option each year 
options granted to non employees have a maximum term of ten years and generally vest over three years with of the total shares underlying the option vesting on the date of grant and of the total shares vesting in each of the next three years 
option grants to non employees have been made in conjunction with and as sole consideration for their service as advisors to us 
certain of these advisors have also purchased shares of stock in our private placement offerings  but none beneficially own or more of our outstanding common stock 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is measured at each reporting date until the option  or respective portion of the option  vests and the expense recorded by us is updated accordingly

we are not aware of any specific or supplemental reimbursement for our esvs mesh and we expect sales to continue at modest levels until additional clinical study data is available 
research and development our research and development r d expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these increases were driven by increases in clinical study and product development activities related to our esvs mesh 
in november we began enrolling patients in post market studies and in august began enrolling patients in europe for a feasibility study for the fda 
during  we also commenced product development efforts intended to support expanding our product labeling to include the use of alternate sealants and to allow physicians to use our esvs mesh when performing sequential grafts 
we expect that our research and development costs will increase slightly as we conduct our emesh i clinical feasibility trial for the us fda 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  these increases were caused by a combination of factors which include compliance costs associated with becoming a public company in february  costs associated with the expansion of our management team  professional service fees and costs incurred to support our commercial sales activity 
the increased costs related to the expansion of our management team and board of directors  both as part of becoming a public company and to support our commercial sales  included approximately  of increased stock based compensation expenses for calendar we expect sg a expenses to remain relatively stable as we continue to pursue our international sales and marketing efforts 

table of contents interest income interest income decreased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  the decrease resulted from the reduction in our investable cash as we generated operating losses and negative cash flows during the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  in thousands year ended december  percent change net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative milestone expense total operating expenses other income expense interest income interest expense realized gain on sale of short term investment change in fair value of investor stock purchase option net loss before income tax cost of sales  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses include non cash stock based compensation expense as a result of our issuance of stock options and restricted stock grants

table of contents research and development our r d expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was driven by significant activities which were substantially completed in  including product development for our esvs mesh  the follow up from our international feasibility trial  as well as the effects of the decline in the market value of our common stock during on the value of and recorded expense for unvested stock options awarded to non employees 
these changes caused decreases of approximately   and  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by costs associated with the initiation of our european post market studies  which began enrolling patients in november selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  these increases were driven primarily by an additional  of costs incurred in conjunction with becoming a public company in february in addition  we expanded our management team to support our both the requirements associated with being a public company and to support our commercial sales activity 
increased costs related to the expansion of our management team and sales marketing were approximately  and  respectively 
milestone expense our milestone expense for the year ended december  was million 
we recorded this milestone expense in conjunction with the first commercial sale of our esvs mesh and it represents the first sales milestone under our assignment and license agreement with medtronic 
under the provisions of this agreement  the payment of this milestone was due on the first anniversary of our first commercial sale of the esvs mesh  or june  and was paid at that time 
no additional milestones under the assignment and license agreement were attained in interest income interest income increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  the increase resulted from the investment of the net proceeds from our february ipo partially offset by declines in short term interest rates from to change in fair value of investor stock purchase option the change in fair value of investor stock purchase option was a loss of million in this loss resulted from a modification to the second kips bay investments  llc kbi stock purchase option  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the option of million 
kbi exercised this option in february income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods prior to the current year 
the state of minnesota enacted a change to their tax code which made the minnesota research tax credit a refundable credit for fiscal years starting on or after january  based upon our research and development costs which qualify under the minnesota tax code  we recorded an income tax benefit of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal and 
table of contents state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  which if not utilized will begin to expire in and  respectively 
utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we experience an ownership change that may occur  for example  as a result of our public offering of common stock in december and ipo in february aggregated with certain other sales of our stock before or after these offerings 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before they can be used 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our liquidity and capital resources as of december  and and for each of fiscal years ended december   and  and is intended to supplement the more detailed discussion that follows in thousands december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital year ended december  cash flow data cash provided by used in operating activities investment activities financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents our total cash resources  including short term investments  as of december  were million compared to million as of december  as of december   we had  in current liabilities and million in net working capital 
as of december   we had  in current liabilities and million in net working capital 
the increase in our total cash resources resulted from the net proceeds of our public offering of common stock in december  offset by cash used in operations for the increase in our current liabilities as of december  was caused by a combination of costs accrued in conjunction with our public offering of common stock and costs incurred in the conduct of our emesh i clinical feasibility trial 
as we continue to pursue regulatory approvals and continue the process of commercializing our esvs mesh in international markets we expect to continue to incur substantial losses  which will continue to generate negative net cash flows from operating activities 
prior to our february ipo  we had funded our operations primarily through private sales of common stock and convertible debt 
as of february  we had received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of equity securities  and net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of the convertible notes payable  all of which have been converted into common stock 

table of contents in our december public offering of common stock  we sold  shares of common stock receiving net proceeds of million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to seek regulatory approval to market our technology in the united states  to expand regulatory approval abroad  to develop and test additional applications of our esvs mesh  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
on october   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with aspire capital fund  llc  an illinois limited liability company aspire capital  which provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein  aspire capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of million of shares of our common stock over a three year period at purchase prices determined in accordance with the purchase agreement 
this agreement was terminated on december  in conjunction with the closing of our public stock offering completed on the same date 
we incurred no costs in conjunction with terminating this agreement 
in april  we sold  shares of common stock to aspire capital pursuant to the purchase agreement for net proceeds of  in the future  we may seek  or have a need  to raise additional funds through various sources  such as equity and debt financings  or through strategic collaborations and license agreements 
we cannot assure that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations  or if such funds are available to us  that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs 
we expect that the proceeds from our december public offering of common stock and prior initial public offering will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next months  and we have no current intention to enter into a credit facility or loan agreement 
we do not anticipate any adverse effects stemming from the lack of available credit facilities at this time 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  offset in part by depreciation  non cash stock based compensation  changes in the fair value of the kbi stock purchase option liability and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
under the provisions of the assignment and license agreement with medtronic  inc  our first milestone payment obligation of million was due and payable on the one year anniversary of the first commercial sale of our esvs mesh 
we accrued this milestone expense in june and remitted the payment in june net cash provided by used in investment activities net cash provided by used in investment activities was million in  million in and  in cash used in or provided by investment activities is related to purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and private sales of our common stock 

table of contents capital requirements we expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to execute our business strategy including conducting clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval for our esvs mesh in the united states  commercializing our esvs mesh in select european and other international markets  conducting pre clinical and clinical trials to expand indications for our esvs mesh and to pursue other product development initiatives  hiring additional personnel for managerial  research and development  operations and other functions  expanding our facilities to increase our manufacturing and development capabilities  and implementing new operational  financial and management systems to comply with sec requirements 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous current and future factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following our ability to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of our esvs mesh  the selling price of our esvs mesh to distributors and the price that distributors charge hospitals  the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost and delays in product development that may result from changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our esvs mesh  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  the cost of expanding our commercial operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  our ability to establish and maintain effective relationships with independent distributors  the rate at which physicians adopt our esvs mesh for use in cabg surgery  and the progress of preclinical and clinical trials required to support our applications for regulatory approvals  including our human clinical trials in the united states 
we expect that our existing resources as of the date of this annual report  which includes million of net proceeds from our december public offering of common stock  in addition to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  to be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials to obtain regulatory approvals of our esvs mesh 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  stockholders interest will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization goals and harm our business 

table of contents if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies to date  we have not entered into long term minimum purchase commitments with suppliers 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under the lease for our facility in minneapolis  minnesota  and certain office equipment 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations the operating lease obligation for our corporate facilities ends september  royalty payments the core intellectual property relating to our esvs mesh was sold to us by medtronic pursuant to an assignment and license agreement dated october  pursuant to the assignment and license agreement  medtronic also sold to us intellectual property relating to a brushed eptfe vascular graft  or the brushed graft product 
as consideration for the sale of intellectual property relating to the esvs mesh and the brushed graft product and other rights granted by the assignment and license agreement  we have agreed to pay medtronic an aggregate of up to million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones relating to our esvs mesh and the brushed graft product and a royalty of on sales of our esvs mesh and any future sales of the brushed graft product 
this royalty will terminate upon the earlier of the expiration of all of the patents and patent applications  or when the aggregate royalties paid reach million 
in june  we paid the first million milestone payment 
in addition  we have recorded royalty expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities as defined in regulation s k item a 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued asu  comprehensive income  or asu  which amended asu presentation of comprehensive income 
these accounting updates require entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement  or in separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the new requirements do not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income  or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the updates are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only  adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition
