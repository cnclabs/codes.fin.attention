on july   the company s newly formed italian subsidiary  cvs ferrari  srl  entered into an agreement to rent certain assets of cvs spa  on an exclusive rental basis  while cvs spa proceeds through the italian bankruptcy process concordato preventivo 
cvs spa was located near milan  italy and designed and manufactured a range of reach stackers and associated lifting equipment for the global container handling market  which were sold through a broad dealer network 
during the third quarter  cvs ferrari  srl commenced operations and employed the rental assets in its operations 
on july   the company purchased the assets which were previously being rented

this business supplies repair parts for a wide variety of medium to heavy duty construction equipment sold both domestically and internationally 
the crane products are used primarily for infrastructure development and commercial construction  applications include road and bridge construction  general contracting  roofing  and sign construction and maintenance 
in the second quarter of  we expanded our equipment distribution segment by creating a new division  north american equipment exchange naee to market previously owned construction and heavy equipment  domestically and internationally 
this division provides a wide range of used lifting and construction equipment of various ages and condition  and the company has the capability to refurbish the equipment to the customers specification economic conditions beginning in september of  the united states and world financial markets came under unprecedented stress 
the immediate impact was a dramatic decrease in liquidity and credit availability throughout the world 
an incredibly rapid and significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe followed 
these events had an immediate significant adverse impact on the company including order cancellations 
the overall market for construction equipment has improved but has not returned to pre levels 
certain market segments  particularly the north american energy sector  is currently very strong 
as result  we have seen a significant increase in orders for our higher capacity boom trucks and specialized trailers 
as of december   our backlog of million represents increases of and respectively when december  backlog is compared to december  and december  backlogs 
as a result  we have taken actions to selectively increase production capacity  including hiring additional manufacturing employees at certain of our facilities 
additionally  our suppliers have increased capacity to meet the increased demand 
as a result  the 
table of contents company s production volumes and revenues have increased consistently during and our backlog has decreased from its peak of million at june  to a current backlog of million 
there  however  is still significant uncertainty  in part due to the european sovereign debt crisis and an uncertain outlook for the us economy and other global markets 
nevertheless  the company expects continued revenue growth in factors affecting revenues and gross profit the company derives most of its revenue from purchase orders from dealers and distributors 
the demand for the company s products depends upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the company competes 
the company s sales depend in part upon its customers replacement or repair cycles 
adverse economic conditions  including a decrease in commodity prices  may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery 
additionally  our manitex liftking subsidiary revenues are impacted by the timing of orders received for military forklifts and residential housing starts 
cvs revenues are impacted in part by the timing of contract awards related to major port projects 
gross profit varies from period to period 
factors that affect gross profit include product mix  production levels and cost of raw materials 
margins tend to increase when production is skewed towards larger capacity cranes  special mission oriented vehicles  specialized carriers and heavy material transporters

gross profit as a percent of sales was for the year ended december  approximately seventy percent of the increase in revenues is attributed to an increase in the sale of boom trucks 
the other product lines  which are not as large as our boom truck product line  account for the remaining thirty percent increase in revenues and they all contributed to the increase in revenue 
their contributions varied from product line to product line ranging from two to twelve percent of the total increase in year over year revenues 
the company is continuing to see a modest but sustained improvement in the overall market for construction equipment  which contributed to the year over year growth in revenues 
the much more significant factor  however  is the strong demand from niche markets particularly those related to oil and gas extraction and power line distribution 
the increase in revenues reflect the company s strategic initiatives which have emphasized the development of boom trucks with higher lifting capacities and specialized trailers that target the oil and gas and power line distribution market segments 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period 
the decrease in gross profit of between years is attributed to a number of different factors  the most significant of which is a change in product mix 
although part sales grew  the growth rate for part sales is not near the rate of growth for unit sales 
as a result part sales as a percent of total sales decreased to from 
as the gross profit percent on part sales is significantly higher than unit sales  it had the effect of reducing overall gross profit percent by approximately 
the gross profit percent excluding the effect of part sales for boom trucks product line  which has the highest gross profit percent of any our product lines  showed a slight improvement between years 
as the sale of boom trucks increased as a percent of total revenues  it had the effect of increasing the company s overall gross profit percent 
this favorable effect was  however  offset by an erosion of gross profit percent for the other product lines and a change in product mix 
a number of different factors and circumstances had an effect on the gross profit percent for the other product lines 
for example  the gross margin percent for distributed products equipment distribution segment decreased as several terex cranes purchased in which were still in our inventory were sold during at a slight loss 
in  the sale of tractors  a product with a lower gross profit percent  increased and resulted in an decrease in the gross profit percent for the port handling equipment product line

the increase in selling  general and administrative expense after adjusting for the non recurring con expo expenses is approximately million 
slightly less than of increase is related to an increase in selling expenses which reflects an expansion of our sales organization along with increases in commissions and other selling expense that increase with an increase in revenue 
another of the increase is related to an increase in employee related costs  associated with additional staff  an increase in performance based compensations and merit increases 
the remaining increase is attributed to several other factors including increase in audit fees related to our auditor opining on internal controls and an increase in travel expenses 
legal settlement at net present value the results for included a non recurring charge of million recorded in connection with the settlement of two product liability cases

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for products shipped fob destination  sales are recognized when the product reaches its fob destination  or when the services are rendered  which represents the point when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer 
for products shipped fob shipping point  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped  as this is the point when title and risk of loss pass from us to the customers 
customers may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  
table of contents tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has authorized in writing that we hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order 
the company establishes reserve for future warranty expense at the point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories 
other intangible assets 
the company accounts for other intangible assets under the guidance of asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the company capitalizes certain costs related to patent technology 
additionally  a substantial portion of the purchase price related to the company s acquisitions has been assigned to patents or unpatented technology  trade name  customer backlog  and customer relationships 
under the guidance  other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment 
goodwill 
goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
the company does not amortize goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
the company selected october as the date for the required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s management 
the company s two operating segments comprise the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
under asu  entities are provided with the option of first performing a qualitative assessment on none  some  or all of its reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if after completing a qualitative analysis  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative analysis is required 
in  the company determined on a qualitative basis  that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than its carrying value and the quantitative two step process was not performed 
in  it was also determined on a qualitative basis  that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the lifting equipment segment was less than its carrying value  as such the quantitative two step process was not performed for the lifting equipment segment 
the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 

table of contents the company performed step one quantitative testing for its equipment distribution segment in in the company performed step one quantitative testing for both of the lifting equipment and equipment distribution segments 
the aforementioned mentioned step one quantitative tests did not indicate impairment 
during the first step  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment using a business valuation method  which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax projected future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
the market approach was also considered in evaluating the potential for impairment by calculating fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable  publicly traded companies 
this analysis also did not indicate impairment 
moreover  the company also observed implied ebitda multiples from relatively recent merger and acquisition activity in the industry  which was used to test the reasonableness of the results 
the company did not have any impairment for the years ended december   and impairment of long lived assets 
the company s policy is to assess the realizability of its long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions for future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
the company did not have any impairment for the years ended december   and warranty expense 
the company establishes reserves for future warranty expense at point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on a percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
litigation claims 
in determining whether liabilities should be recorded for pending litigation claims  the company must assess the allegations and the likelihood that it will successfully defend itself 
when the company believes it is probable that it will not prevail in a particular matter  it will then make an estimate of the amount of liability based  in part  on the advice of outside legal counsel 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of asc income taxes  which requires recognition of income taxes based on amounts payable with respect to the current year and the effects of deferred taxes for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not a tax benefit will not be realized 
asc also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  as well as guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards 
in  the company determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required as all of the company s deferred tax assets were realizable on a more likely than not basis

commodities risk principal materials and components that the company uses in our various manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulics  cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
extreme movements in the cost and availability of these materials and components may affect the company s financial performance 
changes input costs did not have a significant effect on the company s operating performance in the availability of certain components  especially during the first part of the year  may have delayed deliveries 
the company  however  does not believe that availability or lack of availability had any significant impact on the company s full year results 
in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials and components are normally available from multiple suppliers 
however  certain of our businesses receive materials and components from a single source supplier  although alternative suppliers of such materials may be generally available 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
the company actively manages our material supply sourcing  and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
the inability of suppliers  especially any single source suppliers for a particular business  to deliver materials and components promptly could result in production delays and increased costs to manufacture the company s products 
to mitigate the impact of these risks  the company continues to search for acceptable alternative supply sources and less expensive supply options on a regular basis  including improving the globalization
