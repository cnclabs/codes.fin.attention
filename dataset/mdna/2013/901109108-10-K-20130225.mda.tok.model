item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section entitled critical accounting policies 

table of contents in connection with mergers and acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and adversely affect our operating results 
assessing whether an impairment has occurred requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future  which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  and if actual events turn out to be materially less favorable than the judgments we make and the assumptions we use  we may be required to record additional impairments in the future 
we had approximately million of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition 
we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment by applying a fair value test in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or intangible assets should be evaluated 
for example  if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet  it might indicate a decline in the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets and would require us to further evaluate whether an impairment has occurred 
if we determine that there has been an impairment meaning that carrying value exceeds fair value  we would be required to write down the carrying value by the amount of the excess which would represent the impaired portion of these assets 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to the assumptions used to project amounts included in the valuation process and as to anticipated future market conditions and their potential effect on future performance 
changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the determination of far value 
if we determine  based on our assumptions  judgments  estimates and projections  that no impairment exists as of a specific date  and if future events turn out to be materially less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in assessing fair value when we tested for impairment  we may be required at a future date either as part of a subsequent annual evaluation or on an interim basis to re evaluate fair value and to recognize an impairment at that time and write down the carrying value of our goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets 
if we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods  our net earnings and equity could be materially and adversely affected 
the forecasts utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis as part of our impairment test assume future revenue and profitability growth in each of our segments 
if our operating segments cannot obtain  or we determine at a later date that we no longer expect them to obtain  the projected levels of profitability  future goodwill impairment tests may also result in an impairment charge 
there can be no assurances that our operating segments will be able to achieve our estimated levels of profitability 
a number of factors  many of which we have no ability to control  could affect our financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment testing 
these factors include  but are not limited to  i further weakening in the overall economy  ii a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization  iii changes in the discount rate  iv successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets  v adverse changes as a result of regulatory actions  vi a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the overall business climate  vii recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of our reporting units  and viii the resolution of legal proceedings resulting in judgments less favorable than our estimates 
given these and other factors  we cannot be certain that goodwill impairment will not be required during future periods 
in  our interim review indicated that goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired  and we recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of as discussed in critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
as a result  we incurred a significant loss in and stockholders equity declined by million to billion at december  based on our annual review of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which we performed in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that no additional impairment had occurred 
the fair value of the management services segment exceeded its carrying value by while the fair values of all other segments exceeded their carrying values by more than 
the carrying value of the goodwill of the management services segment was million at december  conflicts of interest may arise involving certain of our directors 
we have engaged in joint ventures  primarily in civil construction  with o g industries  inc  a connecticut corporation  whose vice chairman is raymond r 
oneglia  one of our directors 
as of december   the company had a interest in a joint venture with o g as the sponsor for a highway reconstruction project with an estimated total contract value of approximately million and an estimated completion in in accordance with the company s policy  the terms of this joint venture and any of our joint ventures with any affiliate have been and will be subject to review and approval by our audit committee 
as in any joint venture  we could have disagreements with our joint venture partner over the operation of a joint venture or a joint venture could be involved in disputes with third parties  where we may or may not have a conflict of interest with our joint venture partner 
these relationships also may create conflicts of interest with respect to new business and other corporate opportunities 
ronald n 
tutor s ownership interest in the company  along with his management position and his right to designate nominees to serve as members of our board of directors  provides him with significant influence over corporate matters and may make a third party s acquisition of the company or its stock or assets more difficult 
as of december   mr 
tutor and two trusts controlled by mr 
tutor the tutor group owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
in addition  mr 
tutor is the chairman and chief executive officer of the company and has the right to designate one nominee for election as members of the company s board of directors so long as the tutor group owns at least of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
as of the date of this form k  none of the current directors have been appointed by mr 
tutor 
mr 
tutor has advised the board that should he choose to designate a person for appointment to the board at a time when the board already includes eleven members  he would support a temporary expansion of the board to twelve members to accommodate such additional member 
pursuant to the shareholders agreement dated april  and amended by amendments no 
  and dated september   june  and september   respectively  by and among tutor perini corporation  mr 
tutor and certain shareholders of tutor saliba corporation signatory thereto the amended shareholders agreement such expansion would continue until the next meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected  at which time the size of the board would be reduced back to eleven members and the slate of nominees for election adjusted accordingly 
the amended shareholders agreement also imposes significant limits on mr 
tutor s right to vote the shares of our common stock held by the tutor group or to take specified actions that may facilitate an unsolicited acquisition of control of the company by mr 
tutor or his affiliates 
mr 
tutor will nonetheless still be able to exert significant influence over the outcome of a range of corporate matters  including significant corporate transactions requiring a shareholder vote  such as a merger or a sale of the company or its assets 
this concentration of ownership and influence in management and board decision making also could harm the price of our common stock by  among other things  discouraging a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire shares of our common stock whether by making a tender offer or otherwise or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company 

table of contents our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by work stoppages and other labor problems 
we are a signatory to numerous local and regional collective bargaining agreements  both directly and through trade associations 
if we or our trade associations are unable to negotiate with any of our unions  we might experience strikes  work stoppages or increased operating costs as a result of higher than anticipated wages or benefits 
if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage  or our non unionized employees become unionized  we could experience a disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs  which could adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt agreements  in particular under our million senior unsecured notes and our million term loan under our revolving credit facility 
we currently have and expect to continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had a total debt of million  consisting of million of senior unsecured notes net of unamortized debt discount of million the senior notes  million of outstanding borrowings on a revolving credit basis the revolving facility  a million term loan the term loan which has been paid down to million at december   and million of other debt 
we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 
our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the senior notes  term loan and our other indebtedness  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general business purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general business purposes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
we are subject to restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and the indenture for our million senior unsecured notes that could limit our flexibility in managing the business 
our revolving credit facility imposes operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions include  among other things  limitations on our ability to create liens or other encumbrances  enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates  make certain capital expenditures  make investments  loans or other guarantees  sell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets  or merge or consolidate with another entity 
in addition  our revolving credit facility limits our ability to incur indebtedness from other sources without the consent of our lenders 
our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum net worth  minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
our ability to borrow funds for any purpose is dependent upon satisfying these tests 

table of contents our senior notes also impose operating and financial restrictions on us including  among other things  the following limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock  pay dividends on  or make distributions in respect of  our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock  make certain investments or other restricted payments  sell certain assets  create liens or use assets as security in other transactions  merge  consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply with any of the other restrictions contained in these agreements  an event of default could occur 
an event of default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness  causing such debt to become immediately due and payable 
if such an acceleration occurs  we may not be able to repay such indebtedness on a timely basis 
since indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and senior notes is secured by substantially all of our assets  acceleration of this debt could result in foreclosure of those assets 
in the event of a foreclosure  we would be unable to conduct our business and may be forced to discontinue ongoing operations 
funds associated with auction rate securities may not be liquid or readily available 
as discussed in note fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements in item exhibits and financial statement schedules  our investment securities primarily consist of auction rate securities which are not currently liquid or readily available to convert to cash 
as of december  and  respectively  we held million and million in auction rate securities 
in conjunction with our estimates of fair value at december  and  we deemed our investment in auction rate securities to be impaired by million and million in and  respectively 
these impairment charges were deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in charges to income 
in  we did not deem any of our auction rate securities to be impaired  however  the settlement of three securities in resulted in a realized loss of million 
if the auction rate securities market continues to remain relatively illiquid  it is possible that we will be required to further adjust the fair value of our auction rate securities 
if we determine that the decline in the fair value of our auction rate securities is other than temporary  it would result in additional impairment charges being recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  which could be material and which could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  the lack of liquidity associated with these investments may require us to access our revolving credit facility until some or all of our auction rate securities are liquidated 
we retain a certain level of self insured risk for workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability and subcontractor default insurance 
therefore  large self insured losses  associated with several insurable events  could adversely affect our operating results 
we self insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability and certain events of subcontractor default 
we maintain insurance coverage with licensed insurance carriers which limits our aggregate exposure to excessive loss experience in a given policy year 
in addition  we maintain insurance coverage above the amounts for which we self insure 
we accrue currently for estimated incurred losses and expenses  and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims accrued liability to reflect our experience 
however  if excessive loss experience should occur in a policy year or years  ultimate results may differ materially from our estimates  which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow 
although we believe the level of our insurance coverage should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims  it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits 
also  there are some types of losses such as from hurricanes  terrorism  wars  or earthquakes where insurance is limited and or not economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs  it could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow 
changes to our information systems as well as any loss  breach of security  disruption  unexpected data or our inability to implement new systems  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on third party software to run critical accounting  project management and financial information systems 
if software vendors decide to discontinue further development  integration or long term software maintenance support for our information systems  or there is any system interruption  delay  breach of security  loss of data or loss of a vendor  we may need to migrate some or all of our accounting  project management and financial information to other systems 
these disruptions could increase our operational expense as well as impact the management of our business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since we provide diversified general contracting  construction management and design build services to private customers and public agencies throughout the world 
our construction business is conducted through four basic segments or operations civil  building  specialty contractors and management services 
our civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair  replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure  including highways  bridges  mass transit systems and water and wastewater treatment facilities  primarily in the western  northeastern and mid atlantic united states 
our building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets  including the hospitality and gaming  transportation  healthcare  municipal offices  sports and entertainment  educational  correctional facilities  biotech  pharmaceutical and high tech markets 
our specialty contractors segment specializes in plumbing  hvac  electrical  mechanical  and pneumatically placed concrete for a full range of civil  building and management services construction projects in the industrial  commercial  hospitality and gaming  and transportation end markets  among others 
our management services segment provides diversified construction and design build services to the us military and federal government agencies  as well as to surety companies and multi national corporations in the united states and overseas 
the contracting and management services that we provide consist of general contracting  pre construction planning and comprehensive management services  including planning and scheduling the manpower  equipment  materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract 
we also offer self performed construction services including site work  concrete forming and placement  steel erection  electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac 
we provide these services by using traditional general contracting arrangements  such as fixed price  guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts and  to a lesser extent  construction management or design build contracting arrangements 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into arrangements with other contractors  referred to as joint ventures  for certain construction projects 
each of the joint venture participants is usually committed to supply a predetermined percentage of capital  as required  and to share in a predetermined percentage of the income or loss of the project 
generally  each joint venture participant is fully liable for the obligations of the joint venture 
we believe our leadership position as the contractor of choice for large  complex civil and nonresidential building projects will support our long term backlog growth 
we continued to experience increased contributions from our civil and specialty contractor segments consistent with our focus on obtaining higher margin public works projects and enhancing our self performance capabilities 
we expect to continue to leverage our increased self performance and schedule control capabilities to obtain additional large scale civil and building awards 
we have capitalized on this leadership position and these synergies with significant new awards and pending awards across each of our segments  such as the million verrazano narrows bridge upper deck replacement project in new york city civil  the million signal modernization project for the new york city transit authority specialty contractors  the million irrigation and watershed management program for the us government management services  and several large pending awards for the hudson yards development project in new york city building  which will be booked into backlog as contracts for various phases are executed and work is released 
we have also experienced a shift in the stage of completion of our portfolio of large projects that significantly drive our operating results 
as we entered into  we had realized the benefits of successfully completing and closing out several large public works and hospitality and gaming projects across our building  civil and specialty contractor segments and we replaced several of the large projects discussed above with mid size awards that are in earlier stages of completion 
we continue our strategic focus on growing our business by pursuing and obtaining large complex public works projects

despite recent positive trends in the construction market  the current economic environment continues to provide for slower than expected release of large building and civil projects  which have resulted in delayed revenue opportunities and continued margin pressure 
our general and administrative expenses increased in by primarily due to the full year impact of our acquisitions 
our loss from construction operations of million in was materially impacted by a million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge million after tax  as discussed in further detail under critical accounting policies below 
excluding the impact of the impairment charge  our results from construction operations decreased million primarily due to the substantial completion of large projects discussed above and an unfavorable change in new work margin mix  partially offset by the full year contributions from our acquisitions 

table of contents our interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to additional borrowings to fund operations and to complete the acquisitions 
our income tax expense decreased from a million expense in to an income tax benefit of million in primarily due to the reasons discussed above 
the income tax benefit in includes the impact of a million reduction in our provision for income taxes recorded due to the million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  and a million increase to our provision for income taxes due to discrete tax adjustments 
in  we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to existing contracts  and ended the year with a contract backlog of billion  a decrease of billion from billion as of december  the decrease was due to reduced backlog in our building and civil segments associated with continued activity on several large healthcare facility projects and certain tunnel projects on the west coast  partially offset by increased backlog in our specialty contractors and management services segments associated with new recent project awards 
at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  and a ratio of debt to equity of to  compared to working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to and a ratio of debt to equity of to at december  these results reflect the additional leverage we took on during to finance our acquisition strategy 
our stockholders equity decreased to billion as of december  from billion as of december  the increase in our debt to equity ratio and the decrease in our stockholders equity at december  compared to december  primarily reflect the impact of the million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge million after tax recorded during the second quarter of non gaap measures our consolidated financial statements are presented based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
we sometimes use non gaap measures of income from operations  net income  earnings per share and other measures that we believe are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our historical financial performance and future prospects 
we are providing these non gaap measures to disclose additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations  and they are among the indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating the company s financial performance as well as for forecasting future periods 
for these reasons  management believes these non gaap measures can be useful operating performance measures to be considered by investors  prospective investors and others 
these non gaap measures are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap  and they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

recent developments hudson yards project breaks ground on south tower tower c in january  we announced that we had been retained by related companies and oxford properties group as general contractor for the hudson yards development in midtown manhattan hudson yards 
we were also retained for the construction of a residential tower being developed just south of hudson yards on th street and th avenue in new york city 
hudson yards is a acre mixed use development accommodating over million square feet of commercial and residential space 
the master plan comprises approximately  residences  million square feet of state of the art commercial office space  a million square foot destination retail center with an over  square foot two level space of specialty destination restaurants  cafes  markets and bars  a five star hotel  a unique cultural space  and a new seat school  all carefully planned around acres of public open space 
pre construction activities related to the th street residential tower began in early and substantial completion is expected in the spring of the total construction value of the th street residential tower project is approximately million 
physical construction operations at the hudson yards south tower tower c  located across the street from the th street residential tower  began in december and substantial completion is expected in late the total construction value of the south tower phase of the project is approximately million 
the hudson yards project will be booked into backlog as contracts for various phases are executed and work is released 
it is likely that our backlog and eventual revenues associated with the various phases of our work at hudson yards may be significantly lower than the total construction value of each phase because the type of contracts for each phase may initially be construction management not at risk  whereby our backlog and revenues would be reported excluding external subcontractor progress 
however  our profits related to each phase will be based on the total construction value  including the externally subcontracted portions 
there may be provisions within each contract to allow our customer to convert from a construction management not at risk contract to a guaranteed maximum price contract 
if such a conversion were to occur  the company would then recognize the full construction value for each phase of the project as backlog and revenue 

table of contents backlog analysis for our backlog of uncompleted construction work at december  was approximately billion  as compared to billion at december  significant new awards included a million bridge rehabilitation project  a million hospitality and gaming project  a million transit signal modernization project  a million irrigation and watershed management program  a million joint venture bridge and highway project  a million educational facility  and a million stadium renovation project 
in addition  we have significant pending contract awards  including projects such as the hudson yards development  low bids on civil mass transit and bridge projects and various specialty contracts that we anticipate will enter into backlog in the near future as the contracts for these projects are executed 
we are continuing to track several large scale civil and building prospects for both public and private sector customers as we continue to leverage our self performance and schedule control capabilities 
the following table provides an analysis of our backlog by business segment for the year ended december  backlog at new business revenues backlog at december  awarded recognized in december  in millions building civil specialty contractors management services total new business awarded consists of the original contract price of projects added to our backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of and changes in estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our construction business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts and our joint venture contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our projects  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that the method of accounting for contracts is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  under the section entitled d use of and changes in estimates of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules and estimating potential liabilities in conjunction with certain contingencies  including the outcome of pending or future litigation  arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedings relating to contract claims see note contingencies and commitments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 

table of contents our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe that  based on our experience  our current systems of management and accounting controls allow us to produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other minimizing the impact on overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex construction projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
management focuses on evaluating the performance of contracts individually 
in the ordinary course of business  and at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we update projected total contract revenue  cost and profit or loss for each of our contracts based on changes in facts  such as an approved scope change  and changes in estimates 
normal  recurring changes in estimates include  but are not limited to i changes in estimated scope as a result of unapproved or unpriced customer change orders  ii changes in estimated productivity assumptions based on experience to date  iii changes in estimated materials costs based on experience to date  iv changes in estimated subcontractor costs based on subcontractor buyout experience  v changes in the timing of scheduled work that may impact future costs  vi achievement of incentive income  and vii changes in estimated recoveries through the settlement of litigation 
during the year ended december   our results of operations were impacted by a million increase in the estimated recovery projected for a large hospitality and gaming project which was primarily driven by changes in cost recovery assumptions 
excluding the discrete items that impacted our estimated tax rate  this change in estimate resulted in a million increase in our income from construction operations  a million increase in our net income and a increase in our diluted earnings per common share during contracts vary in lengths and larger contracts can span over three to four years 
at various stages of a contract s life cycle  different types of changes in estimates are more typical 
generally during the early ramp up stage  cost estimates relating to purchases of materials and subcontractors are frequently subject to revisions 
as a contract moves into the most productive phase of execution  change orders  project cost estimate revisions and claims are frequently the sources for changes in estimates 
during the contract s final phase  remaining estimated costs to complete or provisions for claims will be closed out and adjusted based on actual costs incurred 
the impact on operating margin in a reporting period and future periods from a change in estimate will depend on the stage of contract completion 
generally  if the contract is at an early stage of completion  the current period impact is smaller than if the same change in estimate is made to the contract at a later stage of completion 
likewise  if the company s overall project portfolio was to be at a later stage of completion during the reporting period  the overall gross margin could be subject to greater variability from changes in estimates 
when recording revenue on contracts relating to unapproved change orders and claims  we include in revenue an amount less than or equal to the amount of costs incurred by us to date for contract price adjustments that we seek to collect from customers for delays  errors in specifications or designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope or price  or other unanticipated additional costs  in each case when recovery of the costs is considered probable 
the amount of unapproved change orders and claim revenues is included in our consolidated balance sheets as part of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
the settlement of these issues may take years depending upon whether the item can be resolved directly with the customer or involves litigation or arbitration 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our contracts and construction joint venture contracts are recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated revenues for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs  including unapproved change orders and claims  during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount up to the costs incurred that are attributable to unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
for a further discussion of unapproved change orders and claims  see item business under the section entitled types of contracts and the contract process and item a 
risk factors 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the accounting period in which such amounts are resolved 

table of contents billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over contract billings to date 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings results when the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred 
for unapproved change orders or claims that cannot be resolved in accordance with the normal change order process as defined in the contract  we may employ other dispute resolution methods  including mediation  binding and non binding arbitration  or litigation 
see item legal proceedings and note contingencies and commitments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules 
the prerequisite for billing unapproved change orders and claims is the final resolution and agreement between the parties

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
construction contract backlog is amortized on a weighted average basis over the corresponding contract period 
customer relationships and certain trade names are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
we evaluate intangible assets that are not being amortized at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment by applying a fair value test in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or intangible assets should be evaluated 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of  the company experienced a sustained decrease in its stock price  causing its market capitalization to be substantially less than its carrying value and its implied control premium to increase beyond the implied control premium that was reconciled in its annual impairment analysis  and beyond the observable market comparable level 
additionally  deterioration in broader market conditions including stock market volatility  particularly in the construction industry  impacted the weighted average cost of capital rate assumptions used in deriving the fair values of our reporting units  which are primarily based on market inputs 
finally  several of our reporting units experienced degradation in the timing of projected cash flows used in deriving the fair values of those reporting units in our annual impairment analysis caused by delays in the timing of awards and start of new work that we anticipated would enter into backlog in the first half of  and a general decrease in profit margins on new work awards that were factored into our forecast assumptions 
in the building reporting unit  the most significant decrease in estimated new work cash flow was the result of political decisions that negatively impacted the advance of a large project for an existing customer 
in addition  we observed an unfavorable change in the margin mix of new work obtained in the first half of compared with prior years 
the majority of the new work awards in the first half of as well as the near term new work prospects were comprised of lower margin private customer work and not the higher margin public works the building reporting unit completed in the past 
the projected cash flows for the building reporting unit as of june  took into consideration the changes in assumptions on new work awards and unfavorable change in margin mix  consistent with its actual results in the first half of 
table of contents in the civil reporting unit  the fourth quarter of valuation anticipated the award and start and or ramp up of a number of projects during many of these projects were delayed for several reasons including political pressures  timing of funding  and general economic concerns 
the change in the estimated timing of recent awards and resulting ramp up of production resulted in deterioration in anticipated future cash flows from fourth quarter of expectations 
the projected cash flows for the civil reporting unit as of june  took into consideration the change in estimated timing of award and ramp up of new work 
within the management services reporting unit valuation for the fourth quarter of  cash flow projections included the anticipated ramp up of work associated with the movement of pacific marine corps operations from the island of okinawa to the island of guam 
during april  united states bipartisan legislators were unable to come to agreement on government spending cuts and certain government projects were suspended 
this left doubt around the timing and magnitude of the proposed move 
the projected cash flows for the management services reporting unit as of june  took into consideration the uncertainty of timing surrounding significant projects with the pacific marine corps on the island of guam 
the first step in the two step process of the impairment analysis was to determine the fair value of the company and each of its reporting units and compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  a second step was followed to calculate the goodwill impairment 
the second step involved determining the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit that failed the first step and calculating the implied fair value of goodwill 
to determine the fair value of the company and each of its reporting units  we utilized both an income based valuation approach as well as a market based valuation approach 
the income based valuation approach was based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expected to generate in the future and it required us to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit in a discrete period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate and a terminal value growth rate for the non discrete period 
the market based valuation approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilized industry multiples of revenues and operating earnings 
we equally weighted the fair values calculated under the income based and market based valuation approaches in arriving at the concluded fair values of our reporting units 
as part of the valuation process  the aggregate fair value of the company was compared to its market capitalization at the valuation date in order to determine the implied control premium 
the implied control premium was then compared to the control premiums paid in recent transactions within the industry 
the company s implied market control premium of and  as of the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of valuation  respectively  were determined to be in an acceptable range of market transactions observed in the construction and engineering industry in the past seven years 
as part of the review process for the reporting unit valuations  we created multiple income based and market based valuation models to understand the sensitivity of the variables used in determining the fair value 
these models were reviewed with our external fair value specialists who assisted in the process by providing insight into acceptable ranges on various valuation assumptions as well as preferred valuation techniques 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to the assumptions used for projections and to evaluate the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
the key assumptions that we used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units under the income based approach are as follows weighted average cost of capital used to discount the projected cash flows  cash flows generated from existing and new work awards  and projected operating margins 

table of contents weighted average cost of capital rates used to discount the projected cash flows are developed via the capital asset pricing model which is primarily based upon market inputs 
we used discount rates that management felt were an accurate reflection of the risks associated with the forecasted cash flows of our respective reporting units 
weighted average cost of capital inputs ranged from for our reporting units 
as discussed above  since our annual impairment analysis  the weighted average cost of capital rates were impacted by broader market conditions including the recent stock market volatility  particularly in the construction industry 
to develop the cash flows generated from new work awards and future operating margins  we tracked prospective work for each of our reporting units primarily on a project by project basis as well as the estimated timing of when the work would be bid or prequalified  started and completed 
we also gave consideration to our relationships with the prospective owners  the pool of competitors that are capable of performing large  complex work  changes in business strategy and our history of success in winning new work in each reporting unit 
with regard to operating margins  we gave consideration to our historical reporting unit operating margins in the end markets that the prospective work opportunities were most significant  current market trends in recent new work procurement  and changes in business strategy 
similar to previous valuations  we noted that small changes to valuation assumptions could have a significant impact on the concluded value  however  we gained comfort over the assumptions selected for valuation through comparison to historical transaction benchmarks  third party industry expectations  and our previous models 
we also estimated the fair value of our reporting units under a market based approach by applying industry comparable multiples of revenues and operating earnings to our reporting units projected performance 
the conditions and prospects of companies in the construction industry depend on common factors such as overall demand for services 
with regard to our reporting units  the carrying values of our building  civil and management services reporting units were greater than their fair values  and as such  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units which resulted in goodwill impairments as discussed above 
in this second step  we determined the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting units that failed step and calculated the implied fair value of goodwill for those reporting units 
we included in this calculation the valuation of assets and liabilities that would occur in a theoretical purchase price allocation of the reporting unit in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s the fasb accounting standards codification asc business combinations  as well as the value of backlog  trade name  and customer relationships and the impact of deferred tax liabilities and assets arising from the fair valuation of these assets and liabilities 
the fair value of our specialty contractors reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  and as such  it was not necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit 
in conducting the initial step of its goodwill evaluation  we also evaluated its finite lived tangible and intangible assets due to the degradation in the timing of projected cash flows since our impairment analysis and changes in the planned use of certain intangible assets 
we compared the fair value of the finite lived tangible and intangible assets to their carrying value and determined that the carrying value of a portion of these assets exceeded their fair value as determined by the income based valuation approach and by benchmarking against observable market prices 
this income based valuation approach involved key assumptions similar to those used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units as discussed above eg projections of future cash flows associated with the company s trade name  contractor license  customer relationship and contract backlog intangible assets that were recorded in previous acquisitions 
based on these circumstances and events  we performed an interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test as of june  and  as a result  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and an indefinite lived intangible assets impairment charge of million in the second quarter of the company also evaluated its finite lived tangible and intangible assets due to the degradation in the timing of projected cash flows since the company s impairment analysis and changes in the planned use of certain intangible assets  and this analysis resulted in a million impairment charge on the company s finite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of 
table of contents consistent with our expectations and as a result of the goodwill impairment charge we recognized in the second quarter of the fair value of the management services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  including goodwill of million  by  while the fair values of the building  civil and specialty contractors reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 
since the interim goodwill impairment test as of june   our annual impairment test  performed in the fourth quarter of  did not indicate any further adjustment to goodwill 
should some of our assumptions not materialize  for example the projected future cash flows for the management services reporting unit in connection with anticipated ramp up of work associated with additional troops moving to guam  additional impairment of up to million may negatively impact future earnings 
changes in our assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit 
such changes in assumptions could be caused by terminations  suspensions  reductions in scope or delays in the start up of the revenues and cash flows from backlog as well as the prospective work tracked  reductions in available government  state and local agencies and non residential private industry funding and spending  our ability to effectively compete for new work and maintain and grow market penetration in the regions that we operate in  our ability to successfully control costs  work schedule  and project delivery  or broader market conditions  including stock market volatility in the construction industry and its impact on the weighted average cost of capital assumption 
fair value measurements our investment in auction rate securities ars is measured at fair value utilizing unobservable level inputs 
we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing an income approach valuation model  with consideration given to market based valuation inputs such as current market conditions  including repayment status of student loans  credit market risk  market liquidity and macro economic influences 
in addition  we obtained an independent valuation of some of our auction rate security instruments and considered these valuations in determining the estimated fair values of the auction rate securities in our portfolio 
our analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value 
see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules for a detailed discussion of the fair market value assessment of our investment in ars 
at december   the carrying value of our investment in auction rate securities approximated fair value 
the contingent consideration involved in the purchases of several of our recently acquired entities is also measured at fair value utilizing unobservable level inputs 
we estimate these fair values utilizing an income approach which is based on the cash flows that the acquired entity is expected to generate in the future 
this approach requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
see notes fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules for more information on our investment in ars and contingent consideration 
share based compensation we have granted restricted stock units and stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which corresponds to the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock option awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock option awards and the expected volatility of our stock price over the life of the awards 
we used the black scholes merton option pricing model to value our stock option awards  and utilized the historical volatility of our common stock as a reasonable estimate of the future volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change which require the use of different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded through december  
table of contents insurance liabilities we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverage 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the estimate of our insurance liability within our self insured deductible limits includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on data compiled from historical experience 
actual experience could differ significantly from these estimates and could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we purchase varying levels of insurance from third parties  including excess liability insurance  to cover losses in excess of our self insured deductible limits 
currently  our self insured deductible limit for workers compensation  general liability and automobile coverage is generally million per occurrence  subject to a policy aggregate loss limitation based upon policy exposures 
in addition  on certain projects  we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of losses and a co payment amount that arise from any subcontractor defaults 
our self insured deductible limit for subcontractor default on projects covered under our program ranges from million to million per occurrence  with a co payment of of the next million  subject to an annual aggregate ranging from million to million 
accounting for income taxes information relating to our provision for income taxes and the status of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv 
item exhibits and financial statement schedules a key assumption in the determination of our book tax provision is the amount of the valuation allowance  if any  required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
our accounting policy requires us to identify and review potential tax uncertainties for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and determine whether the exposure to those uncertainties have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as of december  defined benefit retirement plan the status of our defined benefit pension plan obligations  related plan assets and cost is presented in note employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv 
item exhibits and financial statement schedules 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions which include  among other things  the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
the discount rate of used for purposes of computing the annual pension expense was determined at the beginning of the calendar year based upon an analysis performed by our actuaries which matches the cash flows of our plan s projected liabilities to bond investments of similar amounts and durations 
we plan to change the discount rate used for computing the annual pension expense to based upon a similar analysis by our actuaries 
the estimated return on plan assets is primarily based on historical long term returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our targeted allocation of plan assets equity  fixed income and cash 
we plan to use a return on asset rate of in based on projected equity performance compared to long term historical averages 
the plans benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets on december  and by million and million  respectively 
accordingly  we recorded adjustments to our pension liability with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
effective june   all benefit accruals under our pension plan were frozen  however  the vested benefit was preserved 
due to the expected increase in amortization of prior years investment losses  we anticipate that pension expense will increase from million in to million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan are anticipated to be approximately million in cash contributions may vary significantly in the future depending upon asset performance and the interest rate environment 
results of operations compared to for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of  million  loss from construction operations of million and net loss of million as compared to revenues of  million  income from construction operations of million and net income of million for basic and diluted loss per common share for were and  respectively  as compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of and  respectively  for excluding the impact of the discrete items discussed above in non gaap measures  we would have had income from construction operations and net income of million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per common share of in

the provision for income taxes decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due to the decrease in pretax income 
the increase in the effective tax rate from in to in was primarily due to a more favorable return to provision adjustment experienced in versus potential impact of current economic conditions current economic and financial market conditions in the united states and overseas  including severe disruptions in the credit markets  have had an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if there is a prolonged economic recession or depression or if government efforts to stabilize and revitalize credit markets and financial institutions are not effective  current economic and financial market conditions could continue to adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
the current instability in the financial markets has made it difficult for certain of our customers  including state and local governments  to access the credit markets to obtain financing or refinancing  as the case may be  to fund new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
state and local governments also are facing significant budget shortfalls as a result of declining tax and other revenues  which may cause them to defer or cancel planned infrastructure projects 
we may encounter increased levels of deferrals and delays related to new construction projects in the future 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may increase the rate at which our customers defer  delay or cancel proposed new construction projects 
such deferrals  delays or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held by us as well as our proportionate share of amounts held by construction joint ventures 
cash held by us is available for general corporate purposes  while cash held by construction joint ventures is available only for joint venture related uses 
joint venture cash and cash equivalents are not restricted to specific uses within those entities  however  the terms of the joint venture agreements limit our ability to distribute those funds and use them for corporate purposes 
cash held by construction joint ventures is distributed from time to time to us and to the other joint venture participants in accordance with our respective percentage interest after the joint venture partners determine that a cash distribution is prudent 
cash distributions received by us from our construction joint ventures are then available for general corporate purposes 
at december  and  cash held by us and available for general corporate purposes was million and million  respectively  our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures and available only for joint venture related uses was million and million  respectively  and our restricted cash was million and million  respectively 
we do not believe that it is likely that we will be called upon to contribute significant additional capital in the event of default by any of our joint venture partners 
we require each partner in the joint ventures in which we participate to accept joint and several responsibility for all obligations of the joint venture 
prior to forming a joint venture  we conduct a thorough analysis of the prospective partner to determine its capabilities  specifically relating to construction expertise  track record for delivering a quality product on time  reputation in the industry  as well as financial strength and available liquidity 
we utilize a number of resources to verify a potential joint venture partner s financial condition  including credit rating reports and financial information contained in its audited financial statements 
we specifically review a potential partner s available liquidity and bonding capacity 
in the event we are concerned with the financial viability of a potential partner  we will require substantial cash contributions upon inception of the joint venture to mitigate the risk that we would be required to cover a disproportionate share of the joint venture s future cash needs 
the majority of our joint venture contracts are for various government agencies that typically require the joint venture and or our partners to complete a thorough pre qualification process 
this pre qualification process typically includes the verification of each partner s financial condition and capacity to perform the work  as well as the issuance of performance bonds by surety companies who also independently verify each partner s financial condition 

table of contents billing procedures in the construction industry are based on the specific billing terms of a contract 
for example  billings may be based on various measures of performance  such as cubic yards excavated  architect s estimates of completion  costs incurred on cost plus type contracts or weighted progress from a cost loaded construction time schedule 
billings are generally on a monthly basis and are reviewed and approved by the customer prior to submission 
therefore  once a bill is submitted  we are generally able to collect amounts owed to us in accordance with the payment terms of the contract 
in addition  receivables of a contractor usually include retentions  or amounts that are held back until contracts are completed or until specified contract conditions or guarantees are met 
retentions are governed by contract provisions and are typically a fixed percentage for example  or of each billing 
we generally follow the policy of paying our vendors and subcontractors after we receive payment from our customer

our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in ars 
as such  we classified our ars as available for sale long term investments 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  and our available revolving credit facility  we do not expect the short term lack of liquidity of our ars investments to materially affect our overall liquidity position or our ability to execute our current business plan 
during  we received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of certain of our ars holdings 
for a description of our accounting for ars  see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules 
we hold a variety of interest bearing ars  the majority of which were rated aa at december   that generally represent interests in pools of interest bearing student loans 
these ars provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  the holder of the securities is not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
an unsuccessful auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based upon a formula contained in the security  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
during the first quarter of  we made substantial additional investments in ars 
since mid february  regularly scheduled auctions for these securities started to fail throughout the market at a significant rate 
since that time  we have been successful in liquidating a significant portion of our investment in ars at par value 
during  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in ars was in excess of its fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of million which were deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
we did not record any additional impairment charge during the fourth quarter of since the carrying value of our ars as of december  approximated fair value 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships
