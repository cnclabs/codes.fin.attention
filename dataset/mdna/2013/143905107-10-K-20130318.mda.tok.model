funeral homes and cemeteries purchased after january  are referred to as acquired 
this classification of acquisitions has been important to management and investors in monitoring the results of these businesses and gauging the leveraging performance contribution that a selective acquisition program can have on our total performance 
depreciation and amortization and regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs are not included in operating profit 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million for the comparable period in and gross profit increased by million  or from to our acquired businesses drove the overall revenues higher  and both existing and acquired business contributed to the higher increase in gross profit in compared to operating income increased by million from to due to margin growth from our acquisitions  existing funeral home businesses and financial profit 
net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  equal to per diluted share as compared to million for the year ended december   or per diluted share 
net income for the year ended december  totaled million  equal to per diluted share as compared to million for the year ended december   or per diluted share as we had income from discontinued operations in and a loss in total funeral home and cemetery gross margin results improved in compared to and as the gross profit margin rose to in compared to in and in the increased gross profit margin translated into gross profit of million in compared to million in and million in the improvement was primarily due to the acquisitions 
general and administrative total expenses increased million in compared to  the majority of which was due to hiring additional personnel within our national cemetery and preneed operations and increased incentive compensation 
another source of increasing revenue and gross profit is the income recognized from the investments in the preneed funeral trust funds  the cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and the perpetual care trust funds 
there was a major reallocation of investments that began in the latter half of  which led to increasing revenue over the four year period ending december  as a result of substantially higher income from fixed income securities and from capital gains recognized in the portfolios 
for the four year period ended december   the performance of the funds  which includes realized income and unrealized appreciation  resulted in a return 
investment income realized in the perpetual care trust funds except for capital gains in certain states is recognized as income when earned in the portfolio 
investment income realized in the preneed funeral trust funds and the cemetery merchandise and services trust funds is allocated to the individual preneed contracts and deferred from revenue until the time that the service and merchandise are delivered to the customer 
because higher income has accumulated in the preneed trust funds  management expects increasing revenue in the future as the preneed contracts are delivered 
the increase in revenues from trust earnings from to totaled million and the increase in revenues from trust earnings from to totaled million 
the increase in was due to an increase in realized interest income in our perpetual care accounts and increased earnings from delivered preneed contracts 

table of contents in certain states  we are allowed to withdraw realized trust earnings prior to delivery from cemetery merchandise and services trusts  which management describes as withdrawable trust income 
the withdrawable trust income totaled million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the year over year decline was attributable to substantial gains realized in the trust funds throughout that was not repeated in while the withdrawable trust income is not recognized as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations in the year withdrawn  but it is considered deferred revenue and it increases cash flow from operations 
the withdrawable trust income is treated as a special item in our non gaap presentation of net income and diluted earnings per share 
we are providing below a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations a gaap measure to non gaap net income a non gaap measure 
non gaap net income is defined as net income from continuing operations  then adjusted for special items  including withdrawable trust income  acquisition expenses and the other items in the table below 
non gaap net income is used as a supplemental financial measurement by management and investors to compare our current financial performance with our previous results and with the performance of other death care companies 
the adjustment of special items in non gaap income allows management to focus on the evaluation of operating performance as it primarily relates to our operating expenses

income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the income taxes for and liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows from operating activities and availability under our credit facility 
we generate cash in our operations primarily from at need sales and delivery of preneed sales 
we also generate cash from earnings on our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
we believe that existing cash balances  future cash flows from operations and borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments  commitments  dividend payments and acquisitions 
based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing that we expect to have available  we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
however  if our capital expenditures or acquisition plans for change  we may need to access the capital markets to obtain additional funding 
further  to the extent operating cash flow or access to and cost of financing sources are materially different than expected  future liquidity may be adversely affected 
cash flows we began with million in cash and other liquid investments and ended the year with million in cash and million drawn on our revolving credit facility 
the elements of cash flow for consisted of the following in millions cash at beginning of year cash flow from continuing operations cash provided by discontinuing operations cash used for business acquisitions borrowings on our credit facility and payments on our long term debt obligations  net cash used for dividends of common stock cash used for repurchase of common stock cash used for loan origination costs and call premium on our senior notes cash used for maintenance capital expenditures cash used for growth capital expenditures funeral homes cash used for growth capital expenditures cemeteries other investing and financing activities  net cash at end of year the trends in cash provided by continuing operations have fluctuated over the last two years as we generated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for  we could potentially see a reduction in cash taxes based upon three applications for accounting method changes that were submitted to the internal revenue service prior to december  since approval has not yet been received  we cannot rely upon the benefit that could result 
while there can be no guarantee that the accounting methods will be approved to the full extent applied for  the impact of changing accounting methods would be to reduce cash taxes over the next three years by as much as million 
annually  we spend approximately million on capital expenditures and we plan to acquire funeral and cemetery businesses in and future years 
we spent million  million and million on acquisitions in  and  respectively 
our revolving credit facility provides us the flexibility to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or capital needs

a total of million was outstanding at december  under the convertible junior subordinated debenture 
amounts outstanding under the debenture are payable to our affiliate trust  carriage services capital trust the trust  bear interest at and mature in substantially all the assets of the trust consist of the convertible junior subordinated debentures 
in  the trust issued million shares of convertible preferred securities  termed tides 
the rights under the debentures are functionally equivalent to those of the tides 
for the year ended  we repurchased  shares of these tides for approximately  and recorded a gain of  we converted these preferred shares at the current conversion rate of into shares of common stock equal to  shares  and immediately canceled the shares 
no repurchases have been made in the convertible junior subordinated debenture payable to the affiliated trust  and the tides  each contain a provision for the deferral of interest payments and distributions for up to consecutive quarters

also  the deferred distributions themselves accumulate distributions at the annual rate of 
during any deferral period  we are prohibited from paying dividends on common stock or repurchasing common stock  subject to limited exceptions 
we currently expect to continue paying the distributions as due

uncertain tax positions recorded at december  total approximately million  excluding penalties and interest 
the ultimate timing of when those obligations will be settled cannot be determined with reasonable assurance and have been excluded from the tables above 
refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  the number of deaths is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are typically exposed to a variety of market risks 
currently  these are primarily related to interest rate risk and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks 
the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which we are a party at december   and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analysis are considered to be reasonable near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
however  since it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
in connection with our preneed funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  the related funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity and debt securities and mutual funds  which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values of such investments as of december  are presented in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements presented herein 
the sensitivity of the fixed income securities is such that a change in interest rates causes an approximate change in the value of the fixed income securities 
we monitor current and forecasted interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business and seek to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our million revolving credit facility and million on our term loan 
any further borrowings or voluntary prepayments against the revolving credit facility or any change in the floating rate would cause a change in interest expense 
we have the option to pay interest under the credit facility at either prime rate or libor rate plus a margin 
at december   the prime rate margin was equivalent to and the libor margin was 
assuming the outstanding balance remains unchanged  a change of basis points in our borrowing rate would result in a change in income before taxes of million 
we have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements in the past 
management continually evaluates the cost and potential benefits of interest rate hedging arrangements 
the convertible junior subordinated debentures  payable to the trust  pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
the estimated fair value of these securities is estimated to be approximately million at december   based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these debt instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect our interest costs 
the remainder of the our long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  nor otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease
