the company constantly monitors actual prices against plan prices and adjusts its operational plans to address changes in cash flow caused by commodity price fluctuation 
commodity contracts the company has a risk management policy which is in line with the terms of its bank credit facility that permits management to use specified price risk management strategies for up to of its estimated net oil and gas production which includes fixed price contracts  costless collars and the purchase of floor price options and other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of price volatility and ensure minimum prices for a maximum of months 
the program is designed to provide price protection on a portion of equal s future production in the event of adverse commodity price movement  while retaining exposure to upside price movements 
by doing this  equal seeks to provide a measure of stability and predictability of cash inflows to enable it to carry out its planned capital spending programs 
the mark to market value of the commodity contracts is determined based on the estimated fair value as at december  that was obtained from the counterparties to the economic hedges 
equal then evaluates the reasonableness of the valuations in comparison to the value of other commodity contracts it currently owns as well as recently quoted prices received from other counterparties for various commodity contracts

business risks the disclosures under this heading should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the current volatile economic and financial market conditions  equal continually assesses its risks and manages those risks to the best of its abilities 
equal is exposed to normal market risks inherent in the oil and natural gas business  including but not limited to exploration  development and production risks  volatility of commodity prices  capital risks  funding risks  risks associated with reserves  foreign currency risks  interest rate risks  acquisitions  environmental risks and liquidity risks 
from time to time  equal attempts to mitigate its exposure to these risks by using commodity hedging contracts and by other means 
these risks are described in more detail in equal s annual filings with securities regulatory authorities 
exploration  development and production risks oil and natural gas operations involve many risks that even a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome 
the long term commercial success of the company depends on its ability to find  acquire  develop and commercially produce oil and natural gas reserves 
without the continual addition of new reserves  any existing reserves the company may have at any particular time  and the production therefrom will decline over time as such existing reserves are exploited 
a future increase in the company s reserves will depend not only on its ability to explore and develop any properties it may have from time to time  but also on its ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties or prospects 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to locate satisfactory properties for acquisition or participation 
moreover  if such acquisitions or participations are identified  management of the company may determine that current markets  terms of acquisition and participation or pricing conditions make such acquisitions or participations uneconomic 
there is no assurance that further commercial quantities of oil and natural gas will be discovered or acquired by the company 
future oil and natural gas exploration may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells  but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient petroleum substances to return a profit after drilling  operating and other costs 
completion of a well does not assure a profit on the investment or recovery of drilling  completion and operating costs 
in addition  drilling hazards or environmental damage could greatly increase the cost of operations  and various field operating conditions may adversely affect the production from successful wells 
these conditions include delays in obtaining governmental approvals or consents  shut ins of connected wells resulting from extreme weather conditions  insufficient storage or transportation capacity or other geological and mechanical conditions 
while diligent well supervision and effective maintenance operations can contribute to maximizing production rates over time  production delays and declines from normal field operating conditions cannot be eliminated and can be expected to adversely affect revenue and cash flow levels to varying degrees 
oil and natural gas exploration  development and production operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with such operations  including hazards such as fire  explosion  blowouts  cratering  sour gas releases and spills  each of which could result in substantial damage to oil and natural gas wells  production facilities  other property and the environment or personal injury 
in particular  the company may explore for and produce sour natural gas in certain areas 
an unintentional leak of sour natural gas could result in personal injury  loss of life or damage to property and may necessitate an evacuation of populated areas  all of which could result in liability to the company 
in accordance with industry practice  the company is not fully insured against all of these risks  nor are all such risks insurable 
although the company maintains liability insurance in an amount that it considers consistent with industry practice  the nature of these risks is such that liabilities could exceed policy limits  in which event the company could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition 
oil and natural gas production operations are also subject to all the risks typically associated with such operations  including encountering unexpected formations or pressures  premature decline of reservoirs and the invasion of water into producing formations 
losses resulting from the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company 
oil  gas and ngl prices are volatile the marketability and price of oil and natural gas that may be acquired or discovered by equal energy is and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond its control 
the company s ability to market its oil and natural gas may depend upon its ability to acquire space on pipelines that deliver natural gas to commercial markets 
the company may also be affected by deliverability uncertainties related to the proximity of its reserves to pipelines and processing and storage facilities and operational problems affecting such pipelines and facilities as well as extensive government regulation relating to price  taxes  royalties  land tenure  allowable production  the export of oil and natural gas and many other aspects of the oil and natural gas business 
equal energy s revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of its oil and gas properties are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and gas 
the company s ability to borrow and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent upon oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the control of the company 
these factors include economic conditions  in the united states  canada  the actions of the opec and russia  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign imports and the availability of alternative fuel sources 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of oil and gas would have an adverse effect on the company s carrying value of its proved reserves  borrowing capacity  revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
in addition  bank borrowings available to equal energy are in part determined by the company s borrowing base 
a sustained material decline in prices from historical average prices could reduce the company s borrowing base  therefore reducing the bank credit available to the company which could require that a portion  or all  of the company s bank debt be repaid 
substantial capital requirements equal energy anticipates making substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the future 
if the company revenues or reserves decline  it may limit equal energy s ability to expend or access the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available or sufficient to meet these requirements or for other corporate purposes or  if debt or equity financing is available  that it will be on terms acceptable to the company 
the inability of the company to access sufficient capital for its operations could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
capital markets the market events and conditions witnessed over the past three years  including disruptions in the international credit markets and other financial systems and the deterioration of global economic conditions  have caused significant volatility in commodity prices and increases in the rates at which equal energy is able to borrow funds for its capital programs 
while there have been recent signs which may suggest the beginning of a global economic recovery  there can be no certainty regarding the timing or extent of a potential recovery  and such continued uncertainty in the global economic situation means that the company  along with all other oil and gas entities  may continue to face restricted access to capital and increased borrowing costs 
this could have an adverse effect on the company  as its ability to make future capital expenditures is dependent on  among other factors  the overall state of the capital markets and investor appetite for investments in the energy industry generally and the company securities in particular 
additional funding requirements equal energy cash flow from its producing reserves may not be sufficient to fund its ongoing activities at all times 
from time to time  the company may require additional financing in order to carry out its acquisition  exploration and development activities 
failure to obtain such financing on a timely basis could cause the company to forfeit its interest in certain properties  miss certain acquisition opportunities and reduce or terminate its operations 
if the company revenues from its reserves decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices or otherwise  it will affect the company ability to expend the necessary capital to replace its reserves or to maintain its production 
if the company cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements  there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or available on favourable terms 
issuance of debt from time to time equal energy may enter into transactions to acquire assets or the shares of other corporations 
these transactions may be financed partially or wholly with debt  which may increase the company debt levels above industry standards for oil and natural gas companies of similar size 
depending on future exploration and development plans  the company may require additional debt financing that may not be available or  if available  may not be available on favourable terms 
neither the articles of the company nor its by laws limit the amount of indebtedness that the company may incur 
the level of the company indebtedness from time to time  could impair its ability to obtain additional financing on a timely basis to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise and could negatively affect the company debt ratings 
this in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
reserve estimates the reserves information contained in equal s independent reserve evaluations are estimates 
the actual production and ultimate reserves from the properties may be greater or less than the estimates prepared by the independent reserve evaluators 
the reserve reports were prepared using certain commodity price assumptions 
if lower prices for oil  ngls and natural gas are realized by equal and substituted for the price assumptions utilized in those reserve reports  the present value of estimated future net cash flows for equal s reserves as well as the amount of equal s reserves would be reduced and the reduction could be significant 
foreign currency rates the price that equal energy receives for a majority of its oil and natural gas is based on united states dollar denominated benchmarks and therefore the revenue recorded in canadian dollars is affected by the exchange rate between the two currencies 
a material increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  may negatively impact the company s net production revenue by decreasing the canadian dollar revenue recorded in the financial statements 
equal conducts its business and operations in the united states and is therefore exposed to foreign currency risk on both revenues and costs to the extent the value of the canadian dollar decreases relative to the united states dollar 
interest rates interest rate risk arises from changes in market interest rates that may affect the fair value of future cash flows from the company s financial instruments 
equal has a floating interest rate for its long term debt and fixed interest rate for its convertible debentures 
acquisitions the price paid for acquisitions is based on engineering and economic estimates of the potential reserves made by independent engineers modified to reflect the technical views of management 
these assessments include a number of material assumptions regarding such factors as recoverability and marketability of oil  ngls and natural gas  future prices of oil  ngls and natural gas and operating costs  future capital expenditures and royalties and other government levies that will be imposed over the producing life of the reserves 
many of these factors are subject to change and are beyond the control of the operators of the working interests  management and equal 
in particular  changes in the prices of and markets for oil  ngls and natural gas from those anticipated at the time of making such assessments will affect the value of the shares 
in addition  all such estimates involve a measure of geological and engineering uncertainty that could result in lower production and reserves than attributed to the working interests 
actual reserves could vary materially from these estimates 
consequently  the reserves acquired may be less than expected  which could adversely impact cash flows and distributions to shareholders 
environmental all phases of the oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of international conventions and international  national  provincial  state and local law and regulation 
environmental legislation provides for  among other things  restrictions and prohibitions on spills  releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and gas operations 
the legislation also requires that wells and facility sites be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures and a breach of same can result in the imposition of clean up orders  fines and or penalties  some of which may be material  as well as possible forfeiture of requisite approval obtained from the various governmental authorities 
the discharge of green house gas ghg emissions and other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require the company to incur costs to remedy such discharge 
although the company believes that it is in material compliance with current applicable environmental regulations  no assurance can be given that environmental laws will not result in a curtailment of production or a material increase in the costs of production  development or exploration activities or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that equal is unable to meet its financial liabilities as they come due 
management utilizes a long term financial and capital forecasting program that includes continuous review of debt forecasts to ensure credit facilities are sufficient relative to forecast debt levels  capital program levels are appropriate and financial covenants will be met 
in the short term  liquidity is managed through daily cash management activities  short term financing strategies and the use of commodity hedging contracts to increase the predictability of cash flow from operating activities 
additional information on specific instruments is discussed in the commodity contracts section  liquidity and capital resources section and in note to the consolidated financial statements

the convertible debentures bear interest at per annum and mature march  liquidity capital resources development activities and acquisitions may be funded internally through cash flow or through external sources such as debt or the issuance of equity 
the company finances its operations and capital activities primarily with funds generated from operating activities  but also through the issuance of shares  debentures and borrowing from its credit facility 
the company believes its sources of cash  including bank debt and funds from operations  will be sufficient to fund its operations and anticipated capital expenditure program in equal s ability to fund its operations will also depend on operating performance and is subject to commodity prices and other economic conditions which may be beyond its control 
the company will monitor commodity prices and adjust the capital expenditure program to stay within its means 
the company operates all of its drilling programs and as a result  can control the pace and targets of its capital spending to react quickly to changes in cash flow to ensure ongoing financial flexibility

the company has identified a strong inventory of future drilling locations and has a staff of experienced people in oklahoma managing these assets 
management believes that in addition to successful drilling  there is significant additional upside from natural gas and ngl commodity price recovery 
the company has re commenced drilling in the hunton during and plans to drill up to wells as part of the capital budget of million that was approved by the board  which includes million for drilling and related infrastructure and million for land and maintenance capital 
as a result of the asset sales  the company has strengthened the balance sheet and re paid all of the outstanding debt on its bank credit facility and has surplus cash remaining to exit with a working capital balance of million 
with the strong balance sheet and projected cash flows  equal will pay a usd per share annual dividend  beginning on january  and payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
environmental and climate change risk the oil and gas industry has a number of environmental risks and hazards and is subject to regulation by all levels of government 
environmental legislation includes  but is not limited to  operational controls  final site restoration requirements and increasing restrictions on emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and natural gas operations 
compliance with such legislation could require additional expenditures and a failure to comply may result in fines and penalties which could  in the aggregate  become material 
disclosure controls and procedures as of december   an internal evaluation was carried out of the effectiveness of equal s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule a under the us securities exchange act of and as defined in canada by national instrument  certification of disclosure in issuers annual and interim filings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general this discussion provides information about the financial instruments equal uses to manage commodity price volatility 
all contracts are settled in cash and do not require the actual delivery of a commodity at settlement 
commodity price risk 
equal s most significant market risk relates to the prices it receives for its natural gas and ngl production 
oil represents only of total production so volatility of oil prices has a small affect 
due to the historical price volatility of these commodities  equal periodically has entered into natural gas and oil derivative arrangements  and expects in the future to enter into  derivative arrangements for the purpose of reducing the variability of natural gas and ngl prices equal receives for its production 
the company s credit facility limits its ability to enter into derivative transactions for a maximum term of years and up to of expected production volumes 
the company uses  and may continue to use  a variety of commodity based derivative contracts  including fixed price swaps  collars and basis swaps 
at december   the company s commodity derivative contracts consisted of fixed price swaps and basis swaps for natural gas and a fixed price swap for oil  which are described below fixed price swaps the company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to the counterparty over a specified period for a contracted volume 
basis swaps the company receives a payment from the counterparty if the settled price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the settled price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract  which guarantees the company a price differential for oil and natural gas from a specified delivery point 
the company s natural gas fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon nymex prices  and the company s natural gas basis swap transactions are settled based upon the index price of natural gas at the southern star pipeline delivery point in oklahoma compared to nymex prices 
the company s natural gas contracts are settled based upon the nymex prices on the penultimate commodity business day for the relevant contract 
settlement for oil derivative contracts occurs in the succeeding month or quarter and natural gas derivative contracts are settled in the production month or quarter 
at december   the company s open commodity derivative contracts consisted of the following derivative instrument commodity price volume per day period fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed gas us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed basis differential gas differential fixed us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed basis differential gas differential fixed us mmbtu  mmbtu january  december  fixed oil cdn bbl bbl january  december  nymex southern star oklahoma basis differential 
equal has not designated any of its derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes 
the company records all derivative contracts at fair value  which reflects changes in commodity prices 
changes in fair values of the company s derivative contracts are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in current period earnings 
as a result  the company s current period earnings may be significantly affected by changes in the fair value of its commodity derivative contracts 
changes in fair value are principally measured based on period end prices compared to the contract price 
the following table summarizes the cash settlements and valuation gains and losses on the company s commodity derivative contracts for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december realized gain loss unrealized gain loss gain loss on commodity derivative contracts in the year ended december  million of net realized gain related to early settlements of commodity derivative contracts on oil that were unwound when the canadian oil assets were sold 
this gain was included in results of discontinued operations 
credit risk 
all of the company s hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market 
the use of hedging transactions in over the counter markets involves the risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the financial terms of the transactions 
the counterparties for all of the company s hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating 
the company monitors on an ongoing basis the credit ratings of its hedging counterparties 
the company s derivative contracts are primarily with its lead bank for its credit facility 
a default by the company under its credit facility constitutes a default under its derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders under the senior credit facility 
the company does not require collateral or other security from counterparties to support derivative instruments 
the company has master netting agreements with all of its derivative contract counterparties  which allows the company to net its derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty 
as a result of the netting provisions  the company s maximum amount of loss under derivative transactions due to credit risk is limited to the net amounts due from the counterparties under the derivatives 
the company s loss is further limited as any amounts due from a defaulting counterparty that is a lender under the senior credit facility can be offset against amounts owed to such counterparty under the company s senior credit facility 
as of december   the counterparties to the company s open derivative contracts consisted of financial institutions  of which are also lenders under the company s senior credit facility 
the company is not required to post additional collateral under derivative contracts 
interest rate risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed and variable interest rate borrowings 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to i changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and ii the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
variable rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates as its interest obligations on these instruments are periodically re determined based on prevailing market interest rates  primarily the libor rate 
the company had no outstanding variable rate debt as of december  equal has no interest rate derivative contracts outstanding at december
