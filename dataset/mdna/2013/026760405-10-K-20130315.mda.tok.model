item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an insurance holding company engaged in the insurance and reinsurance business through our wholly owned insurance company  independence american insurance company independence american  our wholly owned business development and program management company  ihc specialty benefits  inc specialty benefits  our full service direct writer of medical stop insurance for self insured employer groups ihc risk solutions  llc risk solutions  and our two insurance and marketing agencies  independent producers of america  llc ipa and healthinsurance 
org hio 
since november  amic has been affiliated with independence holding company ihc  which owned of amic stock as of december  the senior management of ihc provides direction to the company through a service agreement between the company and ihc 
in  a significant amount of independence american s revenue was from reinsurance premiums 
the majority of these premiums are ceded to independence american from ihc under reinsurance treaties to cede its gross medical stop loss premiums written to independence american 
in addition  independence american assumes fully insured health  short term statutory disability benefit product in new york state dbl and long term disability ltd premiums from ihc  and assumes medical stop loss premiums from unaffiliated carriers 
independence american writes group major medical  medical stop loss  major medical plans for individuals and families  short term medical  dental  and pet insurance in given its broad licensing  a excellent rating from am best  and that it is the only property and casualty company in ihc  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its international health  occupational accident  and pet insurance products 
while management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning  the overriding consideration is underwriting profitability 
management assessment of trends in healthcare and in the medical stop loss market play a significant role in determining whether to expand independence american health insurance premiums 
since independence american reinsures a portion of all of the business produced by risk solutions  and since it is also eligible to earn profit sharing commissions based on the profitability of the business it places  risk solutions also emphasizes underwriting profitability 
in addition  management focuses on controlling operating costs 
by sharing employees with ihc and sharing resources among our subsidiaries  we strive to maximize our earnings 
the following is a summary of key performance information and events in thousands year ended december  revenues expenses income before income tax provision benefit for income taxes net income less net income attributable to the non controlling interest net income attributable to american independence corp 
the book value of the company s stockholders equity increased to per share at december  compared to per share at december  the company further reduced the deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million at december  primarily due to the expected increase in future income and due to the utilization of deferred taxes in the past several years 
net income per share increased to per share  diluted  or million  for the year ended december   compared to 
per share  diluted  or million for the year ended december  at december   of the company fixed maturities were investment grade 
consolidated investment yields were for the years ended december  and premiums earned increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to higher direct and assumed medical stop loss premiums  higher pet insurance premiums  and higher assumed international premiums  offset by lower direct group major medical premiums written and lower direct individual health premiums written 
for the years ended december  and  independence american wrote million and million  respectively  of individual health business produced by our marketing organization ipa 
for the year ended december   risk solutions and our agencies generated revenues of million compared to million for the year ended december  due to higher revenues generated at hio and risk solutions  and the addition of ihc specialty benefits in underwriting experience  as indicated by its gaap combined ratios on our three lines of business for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands medical stop loss premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves profit commission expense expenses loss ratio a profit commission expense ratio b expense ratio c combined ratio d fully insured health premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves profit commission expense recovery expenses loss ratio a profit commission expense ratio b expense ratio c combined ratio d group disability premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves expenses loss ratio a expense ratio c combined ratio d a loss ratio represents insurance benefits  claims and reserves divided by premiums earned 
b profit commission expense ratio represents profit commissions divided by premiums earned 
c expense ratio represents commissions  administrative fees  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses divided by premiums earned 
d the combined ratio is equal to the sum of the loss ratio  profit commission expense ratio and the expense ratio 
the company recorded a decrease in the combined ratio in the medical stop loss line of business for the year ended december  an increase in the loss ratio was partially offset by the reversal of profit commissions as evidenced by the profit commission ratio for the year ended december  due to the poor performance on business written through one program 
the company recorded an increase in the combined ratio in the fully insured health line of business for the year ended december  primarily due to higher claims in certain direct and assumed group major medical business 
the company experienced a lower combined ratio for group disability for the year ended december  as a result of the addition of profitable ltd business in critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company consolidated financial statements and this management discussion and analysis 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  where material  including legal and other fees  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are estimated in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
all of the company s policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
medical stop loss the two primary or key assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is determined using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
this was the case with the  and underwriting years that increased decreased by   and loss ratio points  respectively 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible  based on the company s experience to date  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected projected net loss ratio for the underwriting year at december  the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence to the company s underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than fully insured medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from its block of business for prior underwriting years 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured health reserves is that historical claim development patterns are representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impact of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
premium and fee income revenue recognition direct and assumed premiums from short duration contracts are recognized as revenue over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
the company records fee income as policy premium payments are earned 
risk solutions is compensated in two ways 
it earns fee income based on the volume of business produced  and collects profit sharing commissions if such business exceeds certain profitability benchmarks 
profit sharing commissions are accounted for beginning in the period in which the company believes they are reasonably estimable  which is typically at the point that claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
reinsurance amounts recoverable or paid for under reinsurance contracts are included in total assets or total liabilities as due from reinsurers or due to reinsurers 
in  independence american derived a significant amount of its business from pro rata quota share reinsurance treaties with standard security life and madison national life  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of ihc 
these treaties terminate on december   unless terminated sooner by independence american 
standard security life and madison national life must cede at least of their medical stop loss business to independence american under these treaties 
additionally  standard security life  madison national life and independence american have received regulatory approval to cede up to to independence american under most of ihc s medical stop loss programs 
for each of the twelve months ended december  and  standard security life and madison national life ceded an average of approximately and  respectively  of their medical stop loss business to independence american 
independence american reinsures of standard security life s dbl business and of certain of ihc s ltd business 
standard security life and madison national life also ceded approximately of the majority of their fully insured health business lines to independence american 
in addition  in  independence american ceded of its fully insured health business lines to unaffiliated reinsurers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management believes that although sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance has been adjusted to account for the expected utilization of net operating losses against future taxable income 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire between and us federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
investments the company has classified all of its investments as either available for sale or trading securities 
these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations for trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
premiums and discounts on debt securities purchased at other than par value are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations  using the constant yield method over the period to maturity 
net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices when available 
in some cases  we use quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets and or model derived valuations where inputs are observable in active markets 
when there are limited or inactive trading markets  we use industry standard pricing methodologies  including discounted cash flow models  whose inputs are based on management assumptions and available current market information 
further  we retain independent pricing vendors to assist in valuing certain instruments  primarily all the securities in our portfolio classified in level or level in the fair value hierarchy 
the company periodically reviews and assesses the vendor s qualifications and the design and appropriateness of its pricing methodologies 
management will on occasion challenge pricing information on certain individual securities and  through communications with the vendor  obtain information about the assumptions  inputs and methodologies used in pricing those securities  and corroborate it against documented pricing methodologies 
validation procedures are in place to determine completeness and accuracy of pricing information  including  but not limited to i review of exception reports that a identify any zero or un priced securities  b identify securities with no price change  and c identify securities with significant price changes  ii performance of trend analyses  iii periodic comparison of pricing to alternative pricing sources  and iv comparison of pricing changes to expectations based on rating changes  benchmarks or control groups 
in certain circumstances  pricing is unavailable from the vendor and broker pricing information is used to determine fair value 
in these instances  management will assess the quality of the data sources  the underlying assumptions and the reasonableness of the broker quotes based on the current market information available 
to determine if an exception represents an error  management will often have to exercise judgment 
procedures to resolve an exception vary depending on the significance of the security and its related class  the frequency of the exception  the risk of material misstatement  and the availability of information for the security 
these procedures include  but are not limited to  i a price challenge process with the vendor  ii pricing from a different vendor  iii a reasonableness review  iv a change in price based on better information  such as an actual market trade  among other things 
management considers all facts and relevant information obtained during the above procedures to determine the proper classification of each security in the fair value hierarchy 
declines in value of securities available for sale that are judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method 
the company reviews its investment securities regularly and determines whether other than temporary impairments have occurred 
the factors considered by management in its regular review include  but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the company intent to sell  or be required to sell  the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  subordinated credit support  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  current expected cash flows  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including the effect of changes in market interest rates 
if the company intends to sell a debt security  or it is more likely than not that it would be required to sell a debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  the entire difference between the security amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date would be recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statement of operations 
if a decline in fair value of a debt security is judged by management to be other than temporary and  i the company does not intend to sell the security  and ii it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the security s amortized cost  the company assesses whether the present value of the cash flows to be collected from the security is less than its amortized cost basis 
to the extent that the present value of the cash flows generated by a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis  a credit loss exists 
for any such security  the impairment is bifurcated into a the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss  and b the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations  establishing a new cost basis for the security 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
it is reasonably possible that further declines in estimated fair values of such investments  or changes in assumptions or estimates of anticipated recoveries and or cash flows  may cause further other than temporary impairments in the near term  which could be significant 
equity securities may experience other than temporary impairment in the future based on the prospects for full recovery in value in a reasonable period of time and the company s ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
if a decline in fair value is judged by management to be other than temporary or management does not have the intent or ability to hold a security  a loss is recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the securities 
for the purpose of other than temporary impairment evaluations  preferred stocks with maturities are treated in a manner similar to debt securities 
declines in the creditworthiness of the issuer of debt securities with both debt and equity like features requires the use of the equity model in analyzing the security for other than temporary impairment 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which consist of licenses  are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment in the aggregate at the end of the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators arise 
if the fair value of the company is less than its carrying amount including goodwill  further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required 
any impairment write down of goodwill would be charged to expense 
no impairment charge was required in or if the company experiences a sustained decline in its results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  the company may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results

no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at december  the company insurance reserves by line of business are as follows in thousands total insurance reserves december  december  medical stop loss fully insured health group disability generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is determined using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and ii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to the company underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns tend to be representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims  and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impacts of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
the  increase in amic s stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of  which includes an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  and an increase of  in net unrealized gains on investments 
asset quality and investment impairments the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations  which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
the company gross unrealized gains on available for sale securities totaled  at december  approximately of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
the company marks all of its available for sale securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
higher grade investments tend to carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   approximately or  of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in non investment grade fixed maturities primarily mortgage securities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company does not have any non performing fixed maturity investments at december  approximately of fixed maturities  primarily municipal obligations  in our investment portfolio are insured by financial guaranty insurance companies 
the purpose of this insurance is to increase the credit quality of the fixed maturities and their credit ratings 
if the obligations of these financial guarantors ceased to be valuable  either through a credit rating downgrade or default  these debt securities would likely receive lower credit ratings by the rating agencies that would reflect the creditworthiness of the various obligors as if the fixed maturities were uninsured 
the following table summarizes the credit quality of our fixed maturity portfolio as rated  and as rated if the fixed maturities were uninsured  at december bond ratings as rated if uninsured aaa aa a bbb total investment grade bb or lower total fixed maturities changes in interest rates  credit spreads  and investment quality ratings may cause the market value of the company s investments to fluctuate 
the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will have to sell debt securities in unrealized loss positions that are not other than temporarily impaired before recovery 
in the event that the company s liquidity needs require the sale of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate  liquidity or credit spread environments  the company may realize investment losses 
the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments as discussed in note h v of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded losses of  and  respectively  for other than temporary impairments 
of those impairment losses   and  were recognized in earnings for the years ended december  and  respectively  and  and  of impairment losses were recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the carrying value of securities with fair values less than of their amortized cost at december  by the length of time the fair values of those securities were below of their amortized cost in thousands greater than greater than months  months  less than less than less than greater than months months months months total fixed maturities total the unrealized losses on all available for sale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the company impairment policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  in  the company experienced an increase in net unrealized gains of  including  of other than temporary impairment losses recorded in other comprehensive income during the year which increased stockholders equity by  reflecting net unrealized gains of  at december  compared to net unrealized gains of  at december  
from time to time  as warranted  the company may employ investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
further deterioration in credit quality of the companies backing the securities  further deterioration in the condition of the financial services industry  a continuation of the current imbalances in liquidity that exist in the marketplace  a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession  or additional declines in real estate values may further affect the fair value of these securities and increase the potential that certain unrealized losses be designated as other than temporary in future periods and the company may incur additional write downs 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying amount 
goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company performed its annual test at december  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
no impairment charge was required for as fair value exceeded carrying value by more than 
any impairment write down of goodwill would be charged to expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in determining the fair value of the company  we used an income approach  applying a discounted cash flow method which included a residual value 
based on historical experience  we made assumptions as to i expected future performance and future economic conditions  ii projected operating earnings  iii projected new and renewal business as well as profit margins on such business  and iv a discount rate that incorporated an appropriate risk level for the company 
management uses a significant amount of judgment in estimating the fair value of the company 
the key assumptions underlying the fair value process are subject to uncertainty and change 
the following represent some of the potential risks that could impact these assumptions and the related expected future cash flows i increased competition  ii an adverse change in the insurance industry and overall business climate  iii changes in state and federal regulations  iv rating agency downgrades of our insurance companies  and v a sustained and significant decrease in our share price and market capitalization 
at december   the company s market capitalization was less than its book value indicating a potential impairment of goodwill 
as a result  the company assessed the factors contributing to the performance of amic stock in  and concluded that the market capitalization does not represent the fair value of the company 
the company noted several factors that have led to a difference between the market capitalization and the fair value of the company  including i the company s stock is thinly traded and a sale of even a small number of shares can have a large percentage impact on the price of the stock  ii ihc and insiders own over of the outstanding shares  which has had a significant adverse impact on the number of shares available for sale and therefore the trading potential of amic stock  and iii lack of analyst coverage of the company 
if we experience a sustained decline in our results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results 
capital resources as independence american s total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital  the company remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
outlook independence american independence american  which is domiciled in delaware  is licensed to write property and or casualty insurance in all states and the district of columbia  and has an a excellent rating from am best company  inc am best 
an am best rating is assigned after an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company financial condition and operating performance  and is also based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  and intermediaries  and is not directed towards protection of investors 
am best ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities of the company 
since its acquisition by amic in  the majority of independence american s revenue has been from reinsurance premiums  although independence american continues to increase the premiums written on its paper 
during  independence american wrote group major medical  medical stop loss  major medical plans for individuals and families  hospital indemnity  a small amount of short term medical limited medical and dental 
given its a excellent rating from am best  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its products 
the majority of major medical plans for individuals and families business is written through ipa 
we experienced meaningful growth in reinsured medical stop loss premiums in as a result of growth in business written by ihc  and this trend continued in january this increase is attributable to a growing market for medical stop loss as smaller employers identify the advantages of self funding  the expansion of ihc as a direct writer  and the emergence of ihc s captive solution program 
our pet insurance premiums experienced significant growth in as independence american s product was approved in many states  and we expect material growth in and continuing into we continue to focus on direct to consumer distribution initiatives through our newly formed entity ihc specialty benefits as we believe this will be a growing means for selling health insurance and ancillary products in the coming years 
our individual major medical premiums will decline somewhat in and the decrease may accelerate as we stop writing new business in certain states 
business written in will not be written on the public exchanges which may limit our ability to sell to certain insureds 
our small group major medical reinsured premiums are expected to increase in due to a new program  offset as by ihc s decision to stop writing new business in certain states and by the expectation that employers may choose to drop group health coverage or self fund 
we intend to increase our sales of and reinsurance from ihc s sales of short term and limited medical and ancillary health products  such as dental  hospital indemnity and critical illness to offset the reduction in major medical premiums 
we will also increase our dbl reinsurance premiums due to higher sales at ihc 
we have begun selling non subscriber occupational accident insurance in texas  and health insurance for groups seeking coverage for ex patriot employees 
ihc treaties with respect to the ihc treaties  the company s operating results are affected by the following factors i the percentage of business ceded to independence american pursuant to the ihc treaties  ii the amount of gross premium written by standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to the ihc treaties  and iii the amount of gross premium produced by risk solutions and other distribution sources written by carriers other than standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to independence american 
the profitability of the business ceded will also impact our operating results 
independence american assumes medical stop loss  fully insured health  dbl and ltd premiums from ihc under the ihc treaties 
percentage of business ceded in and beyond  the percentage of medical stop loss ceded to independence american will depend on how much ihc determines it has available to reinsure and independence american s desire to reinsure ihc s business 
since the percentage being ceded is now well in excess of the contractual minimum  there is no guarantee that ihc will continue to increase the percentage of business ceded to independence american or  in fact  cede in excess of 
however  risk solutions is a significant producer of medical stop loss business for ihc 
if independence american  standard security life  and madison national life had agreed to increase the average percentage ceded to independence american by from approximately ceded for the twelve months ended december  and standard security life s and madison national life s gross written premium had remained unchanged  independence american s premium would have increased by approximately million  which is approximately of total net premiums earned for the year ended december  that increase in premium  however  would not have flowed directly to pre tax operating income because of corresponding changes in insurance benefits  claims and reserves and other expenses attributable to the increase in premiums 
the company does not expect the percentage ceded to it from ihc will change significantly in the next twelve months 
independence american reinsures of standard security life s dbl product 
standard security life is not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty year 
independence american assumed of certain of ihc s ltd business 
standard security life and madison national life ceded approximately of their fully insured health business to independence american 
standard security life and madison national life are not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty years 
amount of premiums written the gross medical stop loss premiums written by ihc increased in by approximately and premiums earned by amic increased in as a result of an increase in premiums produced by risk solutions 
risk solutions anticipates increasing its production of medical stop loss business in therefore  independence american anticipates reinsuring a higher amount of medical stop loss premium ceded by ihc in ihc has reported that it expects its fully insured and dbl premiums to increase in profitability we had a significant increase in the profitability and growth of our stop loss business in  our largest core business  which we attribute to the more efficient and controlled model of writing the majority of our medical stop loss on a direct basis 
at present  all indicators point to a continuation of this growth and higher level of profitability 
there are a number of market forces that support this expectation 
we have observed a trend on the part of our producers of stop loss to consolidate their business with a smaller number of stop loss carriers 
the direct writing model employed by risk solutions is well suited to take advantage of this trend 
there is an increased interest in self funded options to address concerns about cost and regulatory burdens and we have developed targeted programs to address these needs 
finally there appears to be a market recognition that stop loss buying decisions need to be more about price 
service and fair claims payment practices are also important considerations and the partnership model under which risk solutions operates is increasingly recognized as addressing those issues 
we will continue to focus on our strategic objectives  including expanding our distribution network 
however  the success of a portion of our fully insured health business may be affected by the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act of  as amended  signed by president obama in march  and its subsequent interpretations by state and federal regulators 
the appropriate regulatory agencies have now issued their proposed regulations 
the regulations proposed to date including those mandating minimum loss ratios seem to have validated our strategy of pursuing niche lines of business across many states utilizing multiple carriers 
we have begun a comprehensive review of all the options for the company and we are continuing a thorough evaluation of our options for those health insurance products that may be affected 
although the law will generally require insurers to operate with a lower expense structure for major medical essential health benefit ehb plans in the small employer and individual markets  the law appears to make exceptions for carriers  such as ours  that have a minimal presence in any one state 
non ehb lines of business and medical stop loss have been impacted by health care reform minimally or not at all 
our results depend on the adequacy of our product pricing  our underwriting  the accuracy of our reserving methodology  returns on our invested assets  and our ability to manage expenses 
we will also need to be diligent with the increased rate review scrutiny to effect timely rate changes and will need to stay focused on the management of medical cost drivers as medical trend levels have reversed direction in causing some margin pressures 
therefore  factors affecting these items  as well as  unemployment and global financial markets  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio excluding redeemable preferred stocks of  assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  change in interest rates basis basis base basis basis point rise point rise scenario point decline point decline corporate securities cmo us government obligations agency mbs gse state political subdivisions total estimated fair value estimated change in value the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the company will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business 
in the company analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the company liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures
