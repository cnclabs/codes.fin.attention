segments joining materials segment primarily fabricates precious metals and their alloys into brazing alloys 
brazing alloys are used to join similar and dissimilar metals  as well as specialty metals and some ceramics  with strong  hermetic joints 
joining materials segment offers these metal joining products in a wide variety of alloys  including gold  silver  palladium  copper  nickel  aluminum and tin 
these brazing alloys are fabricated into a variety of engineered forms and are used in many industries including electrical  appliance  transportation  construction and general industrial  where dissimilar material and metal joining applications are required 
operating income from precious metal products is principally derived from the value added of processing and fabricating and not from the purchase and resale of precious metal 
joining materials segment has limited exposure to the prices of precious metals due to the company hedging and pricing models 
we believe that the business unit that comprises our joining materials segment is the north american market leader in many of the markets that it serves 
the joining materials segment was formerly known as the precious metal segment 
tubing segment manufactures a wide variety of steel tubing products 
we believe that our stainless steel tubing group manufactures the world longest continuous seamless stainless steel tubing coils  in excess of  feet  serving the petrochemical infrastructure and shipbuilding markets 
we also believe it is the number one supplier of small diameter mm coil tubing to industry leading specifications serving the aerospace  defense and semiconductor fabrication markets 
our specialty tubing unit manufactures welded carbon steel tubing in coiled and straight lengths with a primary focus on products for the commercial refrigeration  automotive  heating  ventilation and cooling hvac  industrial heat exchanger  and oil and gas industries 
in addition to producing bulk tubing  it produces value added fabrications for several of these industries 
engineered materials segment manufactures and supplies products primarily to the commercial construction and building industries 
it manufactures fasteners and fastening systems for the us commercial low slope roofing industry  which are sold to building and roofing material wholesalers  roofing contractors and private label roofing system manufacturers  a line of engineered specialty fasteners for the building products industry for fastening applications in the remodeling and construction of homes  decking and landscaping  and electro galvanized and painted cold rolled sheet steel products primarily for the construction  entry door  container and appliance industries 
we believe that our primary business unit in the engineered materials segment is the market leader in fasteners and accessories for commercial low slope roofing applications and that the majority of the net sales for the segment are for the commercial construction repair and replacement market 
in january  we divested substantially all of the assets and existing operations of our continental industries business unit  which manufactured plastic and steel fittings and connectors for natural gas  propane and water distribution service lines along with exothermic welding products for electrical grounding  cathodic protection and lightning protection 
the results of this business unit have been classified as discontinued operations in the company consolidated financial statements for  as well as all historical periods  and this reclassification is reflected in the tables and discussion below 
page arlon provides high performance materials for the printed circuit board pcb industry and silicone rubber based insulation materials used in a broad range of industrial  military aerospace  consumer and commercial markets 
it also supplies high technology circuit substrate laminate materials to the pcb industry 
products are marketed principally to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and pcb manufacturers globally 
arlon also manufactures a line of market leading silicone rubber materials used in a broad range of military  consumer  industrial and commercial products 
kasco provides meat room blade products  repair services and resale products for the meat and deli departments of supermarkets  restaurants  meat and fish processing plants and for distributors of electrical saws and cutting equipment  principally in north america and europe 
kasco also provides wood cutting blade products for the pallet manufacturing  pallet recycler and portable saw mill industries in north america 
management has determined that certain operating companies should be aggregated and presented within a single segment on the basis that such segments have similar economic characteristics and share other qualitative characteristics 
management reviews net sales  gross profit and operating income to evaluate segment performance 
operating income for the segments generally includes costs directly attributable to the segment and excludes other unallocated general corporate expenses 
other income and expense  interest expense and income taxes are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by the company management 
recent developments during  we entered into a series of transactions to improve liquidity  enhance our product offerings and position us for growth in our niche markets 
we entered into a million senior secured credit facility 
we made strategic investments in capital projects totaling million 
we acquired a polish manufacturer of brazing alloys and contact materials inmet 
we purchased substantially all of the assets of a north american manufacturer of perimeter metal roof edges hickman 
as discussed above  we divested substantially all of the assets and existing operations of our continental industries business unit in january results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the company consolidated operating results for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit margin selling  general and administrative expenses pension expense asset impairment charge operating income other interest expense realized and unrealized gain on derivatives other expense income from continuing operations before tax tax provision benefit income from continuing operations  net of tax page net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  value added sales for the year ended december  increased million driven by higher demand for our products  primarily in the engineered materials segment 
lower average precious metal prices  principally silver  had a negative effect of million on net sales for the year ended december  the average silver price was approximately per troy ounce in  as compared to per troy ounce for the year ended december  gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit increased to million  as compared to million in  and  as a percentage of net sales  increased to  as compared to in the gross margin improvement of in the year ended december  was principally due to favorable product mix  effective cost control and improved operating efficiency at our manufacturing plants  across all segments 
in addition  lower average precious metal prices  principally silver  also contributed to the increase in gross margin by during since the company precious metal inventory is hedged and the cost of silver is passed through to the customer principally at market  lower silver prices generally result in an increase in the joining materials segment gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses sg a was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales in was primarily due to higher selling and promotion costs related to product sales of the engineered materials segment  higher restricted stock awards  higher self insured employee medical and workers compensation insurance claim costs compared to  as well as costs associated with the company business development activities in  which resulted in the inmet and hickman business combinations 
also  the lower average precious metal prices had a negative impact on sg a as a percentage of net sales  as compared to the prior year 
pension expense for the year ended december   pension expense was million  which was million lower than for the year ended december  the reduction in non cash pension expense was primarily due to a change in the amortization period for actuarial losses to reflect the average future lifetime of the participants  which is expected to be approximately years  a longer period than the average future service years of active participants  which was previously used 
the company believes that use of the future lifetime of the participants is more appropriate because the whx corporation pension plan is now completely inactive 
the company currently expects non cash pension expense will be approximately million in asset impairment charge a non cash asset impairment charge of million was recorded for the year ended december  the non cash asset impairment charge was related to vacant land owned by the company arlon segment located in rancho cucamonga  california 
the company reduced this property carrying value by million to reflect its lower fair market value 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in as a result of certain subordinated note repurchases during both and  interest expense included a million loss for the year ended december  and a million gain in the year ended december  related to such repurchases 
in addition  the company wrote off million in prior debt issuance costs based on the company fourth quarter of debt refinancing 
these unfavorable impacts on interest expense were partially offset by a lower average amount of borrowings outstanding and lower average interest rates on outstanding debt in realized and unrealized gain on derivatives realized and unrealized gain loss on derivatives for the years ended december  and december  were as follows page year ended in thousands december  derivative commodity contracts derivative features of subordinated notes total realized and unrealized gain on derivatives h h utilizes precious metal forward and future contracts to economically hedge its precious metal inventory against price fluctuations 
the factors that affect the gain or loss on these derivative instruments are changes in the price of precious metals and the amount of ounces hedged 
the million gain in the year ended december  was primarily driven by an average silver price decrease during the year 
while decreasing the use of hedging contracts with brokers  the company has entered into more fixed price sales agreements with its customers  thereby hedging silver prices in that manner 
in addition  the company subordinated notes have embedded call premiums and warrants associated with them 
the company has treated the fair value of these features together as both a discount on the debt and a derivative liability at inception of the loan agreement 
the discount is being amortized over the year life of the notes as an adjustment to interest expense  and the derivative is marked to market at each balance sheet date 
interest rates and the market price of hnh stock are significant factors that influence the valuation of the derivative 
income taxes for the years ended december  and  a tax provision of million and a tax benefit of million from continuing operations were recorded  respectively 
the increase in the tax provision for the year ended december   as compared to  was due to a higher federal tax provision resulting principally from the non recurring benefit of the company reversal of its deferred income tax valuation allowance for federal nols in the fourth quarter of as further described below

gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million in gross profit margin for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to in the lower gross profit margin was primarily due to higher silver costs in the joining materials segment 
since the company precious metal inventory is hedged and the cost of silver is passed through to customers principally at market  higher silver prices generally result in a reduction in the joining materials segment gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a was million higher for the year ended december   as compared to  reflecting higher variable selling costs and non cash restricted stock expense of million 
sg a as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december   as compared to in restructuring expenses of million were recorded in related to a restructuring project in the kasco segment 
the restructuring costs incurred were primarily for severance and moving costs 
also in  the company recorded a gain of million from insurance proceeds related to a loss from a fire that occurred at its indiana tube mexico location 
pension expense page a non cash pension expense of million was recorded in  compared to million of non cash pension expense in the non cash pension expense in both periods primarily represents actuarial loss amortization 
such actuarial loss occurred principally because investment return on the assets of the whx pension plan was significantly less than the assumed return rates of and in and  respectively 
the increase in the pension expense reflects a higher amount of actuarial loss amortization in  as compared to asset impairment charge a non cash asset impairment charge of million was recorded for the year ended december  the non cash asset impairment charge was related to vacant land owned by the company arlon segment located in rancho cucamonga  california 
the company reduced this property carrying value by million to reflect its lower fair market value 
during the second quarter of  kasco commenced a restructuring plan to move its atlanta  georgia operation to an existing facility in mexico 
in connection with this restructuring project  the company performed a valuation of its land  building and houses located in atlanta and recorded an asset impairment charge of million 
the impairment represented the difference between the assets book value and fair market value as a result of a decline in the real estate market in the area where the properties are located

in  h h recorded a loss of million on these precious metal contracts  as compared to a loss of million in the lower loss in was primarily driven by a reduction in the amount of ounces under contract in  as compared to while decreasing the use of hedging contracts with brokers  the company has entered into more fixed price sales agreements with its customers  thereby hedging silver prices in that manner 
in addition  the company subordinated notes have embedded call premiums and warrants associated with them 
the company has treated the fair value of these features together as both a discount on the debt and a derivative liability at inception of the loan agreement 
the discount is being amortized over the year life of the notes as an adjustment to interest expense  and the derivative liability is marked to market at each balance sheet date 
the market price of hnh stock is a significant factor that influences the valuation of the derivative liability 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an unrealized gain of million  as compared to an unrealized loss of million for the approximate four month period that the subordinated notes were outstanding in income taxes in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its judgment about the realizability of certain of its deferred income tax assets 
the company considered factors such as future operating income of its subsidiaries  the amount and mix of expected future taxable income  and available carryforward periods 
as a result  the company estimated that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the benefit of certain deferred income tax assets 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a net tax benefit as a result of the non cash reversal of a significant portion of its deferred income tax valuation allowance  which was the principal reason for recording an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   a tax expense of million from continuing operations was recorded  principally for state and foreign income taxes

liquidity and capital resources the company principal source of liquidity is its cash flows from operations 
as of december   the company current assets totaled million  its current liabilities totaled million and its working capital was million  as compared to working capital of million as of december  the company debt is principally held by h h group  a wholly owned subsidiary of hnh 
hnh subsidiaries borrow funds in order to finance capital expansion programs and for working capital needs 
the terms of certain of those financing arrangements place restrictions on distributions of funds to hnh  subject to certain exceptions including required pension payments to the whx corporation pension plan 
the company does not expect these restrictions to have an impact on hnh ability to meet its cash obligations 
hnh ongoing operating cash flow requirements consist primarily of arranging for the funding of the minimum requirements of the whx corporation pension plan and paying hnh administrative costs 
the company expects to have required minimum contributions to the whx pension plan of million  million  million  million  million and million in     and thereafter  respectively 
such required contributions are estimated based upon assumptions regarding such matters as discount rates on future obligations  assumed rates of return on plan assets and legislative changes 
actual future pension costs and required funding obligations will be affected by changes in the factors and assumptions described in the previous sentence  as well as other changes such as any plan termination 
on november   h h group entered into a million senior secured credit facility  consisting of a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million and a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million collectively  senior credit facility 
the company believes it has access to adequate resources to meet its needs for normal operating costs  capital expenditure  mandatory debt redemptions and working capital for its existing business 
these resources include cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities and unused lines of credit 
in january  we divested substantially all of the assets and existing operations of our continental industries business unit for a cash sales price totaling approximately million less transaction fees  subject to a final working capital adjustment  with proceeds of million currently held in escrow pending resolution of certain indemnification provisions contained in the sales agreement 
the company ability to satisfy debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures and required pension payments  and make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets in which it operates  as well as financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond its control 
the ability of h h group to draw on the senior credit facility is limited by a borrowing base of accounts receivable and inventory

there can be no assurances that h h group will continue to have access to its lines of credit if its financial performance does not satisfy the relevant borrowing base criteria and financial covenants set forth in the financing agreement 
if h h group does page not meet certain of its financial covenants or satisfy its borrowing base criteria  and if it is unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from the respective lenders on terms acceptable to management  its ability to access available lines of credit could be limited  its debt obligations could be accelerated by the respective lenders and liquidity could be adversely affected 
management is utilizing the following strategies to continue to enhance liquidity continuing to implement improvements  using the hnh business system  throughout all of the company operations to increase sales and operating efficiencies  supporting profitable sales growth both internally and potentially through acquisitions and evaluating from time to time and as appropriate  strategic alternatives with respect to its businesses and or assets

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt estimated interest expense a minimum pension contributions b lease commitments a estimated interest expense does not include non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts  which are included in interest expense in the company consolidated financial statements 
the interest rates used to estimate future interest expense were based on interest rates at december  as the majority of the company long term debt bears interest at variable rates  any future interest rate fluctuations will impact future cash payments 
b actual future pension costs and required funding obligations will be affected by changes in the factors and assumptions described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as other changes such as any plan termination 
in connection with its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of hickman in december  h h agreed it would pay additional contingent consideration under the asset purchase agreement if the combined net sales of certain identified products exceed the parameters set forth in the asset purchase agreement in and the additional consideration would be equal to of net sales in excess of the specified parameters 
in no event shall the additional contingent consideration exceed million 
the company facilities and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations imposed by federal  state  foreign and local authorities relating to the protection of the environment

the company has incurred  and in the future may continue to incur  liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination detected at sites owned or operated by the company including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites  abutters or other persons and the sites at which it has disposed of hazardous substances 
as of december   the company established a reserve totaling million with respect to certain presently estimated environmental remediation costs 
this reserve may not be adequate to cover the ultimate costs of remediation  including discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations  which could result in significant additional costs 
in addition  the company expects that future regulations  and changes in the text or interpretation of existing regulations  may subject it to increasingly stringent standards 
compliance with such requirements may make it necessary for the company to retrofit existing facilities with additional pollution control equipment  undertake new measures in connection with the storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of by products and wastes or take other steps  which may be at a substantial cost to it 
off balance sheet arrangements it is not the company usual business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements  such as guarantees on loans and financial commitments  indemnification arrangements and retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity for securitization purposes

critical accounting policies the company discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience  expected future cash flows and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
us gaap requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the company consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
at december   the company had recorded goodwill totaling million 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with us gaap 
the company uses judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
circumstances that could trigger an interim impairment test include  but are not limited to the occurrence of a significant change in circumstances  such as continuing adverse business conditions or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed  or results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
the testing of goodwill for impairment is performed at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit based on actual goodwill valued in connection with each business combination consummated within each reporting unit 
six reporting units of the company have goodwill assigned to them 
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value  step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the amount of impairment loss 
step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill 
in performing the first step of the impairment test  the company also reconciles the aggregate estimated fair value of its reporting units to its enterprise value  which includes a control premium 
to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  the company considered an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis dcf and calculates the fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
assumptions used in the dcf require the exercise of significant judgment  including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan  and the estimates reflect assumed growth rates 
the company believes the assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the discount rates  which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections  used in the dcf are based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital wacc of a market participant 
such estimates are derived from its analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective 
the company believes the assumptions used to determine the fair value of its respective reporting units are reasonable 
if different assumptions were used  particularly with respect to forecasted cash flows or waccs  different estimates of fair value may result  and there could be the potential that an impairment charge would result 
actual operating results and the related cash flows of the reporting units could differ from the estimated operating results and related cash flows 
the recoverability of goodwill may be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
page a market approach values a business by considering the prices at which shares of capital stock  or related underlying assets  of reasonably comparable companies are trading in the public market  or the transaction price at which similar companies have been acquired 
if comparable companies are not available  the market approach is not used 
relative weights are then given to the results of each of these approaches  based on the facts and circumstances of the business being valued 
the use of multiple approaches income and market approaches is considered preferable to a single method 
in the company case  more weight is given to the income approach because it generally provides a reliable estimate of value for an ongoing business which has a reliable forecast of operations  and suitable comparable public companies are generally not available to be used under the market approach 
the income approach closely parallels investors consideration of the future benefits derived from ownership of an asset 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company also estimates the depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment  and reviews the assets for impairment if events  or changes in circumstances  indicate that it may not recover the carrying amount of an asset 
long lived assets consisting of land and buildings used in previously operating businesses are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are included primarily in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
a reduction in the carrying value of such long lived assets used in previously operating businesses is recorded as an asset impairment charge in the consolidated income statement 
pension and post retirement benefit costs the company maintains qualified and non qualified pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans 
the company recorded pension expense of million for the year ended december   and  at december   the company had recorded pension liabilities totaling million 
pension benefits are generally based on years of service and the amount of compensation at the time of retirement 
however  the qualified pension benefits have been frozen for all participants 
the company pension and post retirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
material changes in the company pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the level of benefits provided  changes to the level of contributions to these plans and other factors 
the company determines its actuarial assumptions for its pension and post retirement plans on december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and post retirement expense for the following year 
the discount rate assumption is derived from the rate of return on high quality bonds as of december of each year 
the whx pension plan assets are diversified as to type of assets  investment strategies employed and number of investment managers used 
investments may include equities  fixed income  cash equivalents  convertible securities  insurance contracts and private investment funds 
derivatives may be used as part of the investment strategy 
the company may direct the transfer of assets between investment managers in order to rebalance the portfolio in accordance with asset allocation guidelines established by the company 
the private investment funds  or the investment funds they are invested in  own marketable and non marketable securities and other investment instruments 
such investments are valued by the private investment funds  underlying investment managers or the underlying investment funds at fair value  as described in their respective financial statements and offering memorandums 
the company utilizes these values in quantifying the value of the assets of its pension plans  which are then used in the determination of the unfunded pension liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation of some of the pension plans investments in private investment funds and some of the underlying investments held by the investment funds  the recorded value may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for some of these investments for which market quotations are not readily available 
management uses judgment to make assumptions on which its employee benefit liabilities and expenses are based 
the effect of a change in two key assumptions for the company pension plans is summarized as follows page assumptions income statement impact balance sheet impact in millions discount rate increase decrease expected return on assets increase n a decrease n a estimated impact on annual net periodic benefit costs 
estimated impact on december  pension liability 
income taxes the company recorded a tax provision of million for the year ended december   and current and non current deferred income tax assets  after valuation allowances  totaling million and million  respectively  at december  as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce deferred income tax assets if  and to the extent that  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on an on going evaluation of current information including  among other things  estimates of future earnings in different tax jurisdictions and the expected timing of deferred income tax asset and liability reversals 
the company believes that the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based  in part  on an estimate of future taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which it does business  which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur  as well as on the estimated timing of the reversal of temporary differences  which give rise to its deferred income tax assets  and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates in future periods  and depending on the tax strategies that the company may be able to implement  changes to the valuation allowance could impact its financial position and results of operations 
the company recognizes an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  based on the technical merits of the position 
the income tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority 
the determination of an uncertain tax position and the likelihood of it being realized requires critical judgment and estimates 
the company carefully assesses each of the uncertain tax positions in order to determine the tax benefit that can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
its records and or discloses such potential tax liabilities  as appropriate  and reasonably estimates its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets 
if new information becomes available  adjustments will be charged against income at that time 
the company does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on its reported results of operations 
environmental remediation the company facilities and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations imposed by federal  state  foreign and local authorities relating to the protection of the environment 
the company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable  which is a critical accounting estimate 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
at december   total accruals for environmental remediation were million 
this reserve may not be adequate to cover the ultimate costs page of remediation  including discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations  which could result in significant additional costs  unfavorably impacting the company financial position and results of operations 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
instead  an entity is required to present comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of income and other comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of  which resulted in presentational changes only 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices  interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies 
we enter into derivative instruments to hedge certain commodity price and interest rate risks 
we do not engage in commodity  interest rate  investment or currency speculation  and no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
no credit loss is anticipated on our derivative agreements as the counterparties are major financial institutions that are highly rated 
hnh quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management opinion about the risk associated with the company financial instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices  interest rates and other industry specific risk factors 
to the extent these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes may differ materially from those discussed herein 
commodity prices in the normal course of business  hnh and its subsidiaries are exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas  electricity  precious metals  steel products and certain non ferrous metals used as raw materials 
hnh is also exposed to the effects of price fluctuations on the value of its commodity inventories  specifically  its precious metal inventories 
the raw materials and energy which we use are largely commodities  subject to price volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand and governmental controls 
hnh market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and services  sourced from more than one vendor  and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
hnh enters into commodity futures and forward contracts in order to economically hedge the portion of its precious metal inventory that is not subject to fixed price contracts with customers against price fluctuations 
future and forward contracts to buy or sell precious metals are the derivatives used for this objective 
as these derivatives are not designated as accounting hedges under asc subtopic  derivatives and hedging  they are accounted for as derivatives with no hedge designation 
these derivatives are marked to market  and both realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in current period earnings as other income loss 
the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives is included in other current assets or accrued liabilities 
as of december   hnh had entered into forward and future contracts  with settlement dates ranging from january to march  for gold with a total value of million and for silver with a total value of million 
certain customers and suppliers of hnh subsidiary  h h  choose to do business on a pool basis 
such customers or suppliers furnish precious metal to subsidiaries of h h for return in fabricated form or for purchase from or return to the supplier 
when the customer precious metal is returned in fabricated form  the customer is charged a fabrication charge 
the value of pooled precious metal is not included in hnh consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   h h customer metal consisted of  ounces of silver  ounces of gold and  ounces of palladium 
to the extent that we have not mitigated our exposure to rising raw material and energy prices  we may not be able to increase our prices to our customers to offset such potential raw material or energy price increases  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flows 
interest rates page at hnh  the fair value of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  short term borrowings and accounts payable approximate their carrying values and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments or the variable nature of underlying interest rates 
at december   hnh portfolio of debt was comprised of variable rate and fixed rate instruments 
accordingly  the fair value of such instruments may be relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
an increase or decrease in interest expense from a change in interest rates would be approximately million on an annual basis based on total debt outstanding at december  in addition  the fair value of such instruments is also affected by investors assessments of the risks associated with industries in which hnh operates  as well as its overall creditworthiness and ability to satisfy such obligations upon their maturity 
hnh is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
generally  the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall  and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
to manage our interest rate risk exposure and fulfill a requirement of h h group senior credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap in february to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
under the interest rate swap  the company receives one month libor in exchange for a fixed interest rate of over the life of the agreement on an initial million notional amount of debt  with the notional amount decreasing by million  million and million per quarter in  and  respectively 
the agreement expires in february a reduction in long term interest rates could materially increase hnh cash funding obligations to the whx pension plan 
investments the company holds an investment in the common stock of a single public company  which is classified as an available for sale security and consequently is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in equity 
the company evaluates this investment for impairment on a quarterly basis 
at december   the cost basis of this investment was million and the fair value was million 
there have been no sales or realized gains or losses from this marketable security  and no impairments  whether other than temporary or not  have been recognized 
foreign currency exchange rates hnh manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and  as a result  is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of its operating costs for its non us operations are denominated in local currencies 
the company major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in asia  europe  canada and mexico 
the company is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to anticipated revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
the company has not generally used derivative instruments to manage these specific risks 
during the years ended december   and  the company incurred losses from foreign currency fluctuations totaling million  million and million  respectively
