risk factors all information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors  which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business  operating results or financial condition 
the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face 
these risks can and will change in the future 
continuing uncertain economic conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our operating results 
the continuing global economic uncertainty and related political and fiscal challenges in the us and abroad particularly the eurozone due to the debt and fiscal crises of recent years have  among other things  limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products  contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer  storage  and networking industries at large  as well as the information technology it market  and potentially constrains future access to capital for our suppliers  customers and partners 
the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive  affecting all participants in our industry  and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain 
moreover  a significant portion of our sales are to eurozone customers and  accordingly  we are particularly sensitive to developments in that region 
additionally  fiscal restraints have caused  and may in the future again cause governments to defer purchases in response to tighter budgets 
consequently  we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future  and potentially cause harm to our operating results and failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations 
when and if the current macroeconomic challenges are resolved  we expect the risk of economic uncertainty to continue  with the potential to restrict our visibility and harm our operating results 
our business may be harmed if growth in the storage market declines 
our industry has experienced significant historical growth due to the continuing increase in the demand for storage by consumers  enterprises and government bodies around the world  and our customers purchases of storage solutions to address this demand 
while it spending has fluctuated periodically due to technology transitions and changing economic and business environments  overall growth in demand for storage has continued 
recent technology trends  such as the emergence of hosted or cloud storage  software as a service saas and mobile data access are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements 
the impact of these trends on overall long term growth patterns is uncertain 
nevertheless  if the general level of historic industry growth  or if the growth of the specific markets in which we compete  were to decline  our business and results of operations could suffer 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially  which could harm our common stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so  sometimes materially 
all of the matters discussed in this risk factor section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year 
in addition to those matters  we face the following issues which could impact our quarterly results seasonality  such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year  with the latter due in part to the impact of the us federal government s september fiscal year end on the timing of its orders  and linearity  such as our historical intra quarter bookings and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter s total bookings and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter 
if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 

table of contents our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and  if disrupted  could harm our operating results 
our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast 
we sell to a variety of customers  with a corresponding variety of sales cycles 
in addition  the majority of our sales are made indirectly through channel partners  including value added resellers  systems integrators  distributors  original equipment manufacturers oems and strategic business partners 
during the year ended april   revenues generated from sales through our indirect channel accounted for of net revenues 
this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue  particularly within any particular fiscal quarter or year 
moreover  our relationships with our indirect channel partners are critical to our success 
the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results  as qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met 
if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners  if their financial condition  business or customer relationships were to weaken or if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements  our business and operating results could be harmed 
if we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter our financial results will be harmed 
we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter 
bookings typically follow intra quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 
if we do not achieve the level  timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns  or if we experience cancellations of significant orders  our financial results will be harmed 
additionally  due to the complexities associated with revenue recognition  we may not be able to accurately forecast our non deferred and deferred revenues  which could harm our operating results 
we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines 
we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed 
it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly  and if revenue levels are below our expectations  operating results will be adversely impacted 
during periods of uneven growth or decline  we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits  which could also harm our operating results 
we have made  and will continue to make  significant investments in engineering  sales  service and support  marketing and other functions to support and grow our business 
we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits  such as revenue growth  and the return on these investments may be lower  or may develop more slowly  than we expect  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we do not manufacture our products or their components 
instead  we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components  such as hard disk drives  as well as for associated logistics 
our lack of direct responsibility for  and control over  these elements of our business  as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers  creates significant risks for us  including  among other things limited ability to control the quality  quantity and cost of our products or of their components  the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers that are higher than market rates  limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers demand fluctuations  labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own  
table of contents geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain  business  legal compliance  litigation and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship our products in the quantities  quality and manner we require  and disruptions due to floods  earthquakes  storms and other natural disasters  particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources 
we have encountered some of these risks  such as the thailand floods  which subjected us to supply constraints  price increases and minimum purchase commitments  and expect to be subject to similar risks in the future 
when we do  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
the risks associated with our out sourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers  introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers  at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us  our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers  becomes critical 
new manufacturers  products  components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers 
any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality  quantity or delivery requirements in a cost effective manner will harm our business  operating results and customer relationships 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products  including certain single source suppliers  which has subjected us  and could in the future subject us to price rigidity  periodic supply constraints  and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded 
when industry supply is constrained  our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors  all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do 
accordingly  our operating results may be harmed 
our gross margins vary 
our gross margins reflect a variety of factors  including competitive pricing  component and product design  the volume and relative mixture of product  services and software entitlements and maintenance sem revenues 
increased component costs  increased pricing pressures  the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product price  changes in product  services and sem revenue mixture or decreased volume could harm our revenues  gross margins or earnings 
our gross margins are also impacted by quality failures and our sales and distribution activities  including  without limitation  pricing actions  rebates  sales initiatives and discount levels  and the timing of service contract renewals 
the costs of third party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs 
while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs  we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase 
any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs 
an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings 
increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results 
the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and consolidation 
we compete with many companies in the markets we serve 
over the last decade  the expansion of market opportunities by large  broad portfolio technology companies  by vertical integration of storage products  technologies and services  such as the acquisition of sun microsystems by oracle  and through internal and external storage related corporate initiatives  by companies such as hp  dell and ibm  has increased the number of large  diversified technology companies with which we compete 
accordingly  many of our key competitors have greater financial resources and offer a broad portfolio of it products and 
table of contents services full stack vendors 
these competitors typically maintain broad and deep relationships with customers and partners across a diverse portfolio of products and services 
they may also be able to offer lower pricing or other preferred terms on storage system products due to these broader relationships 
we believe further storage market expansion by large  diversified technology companies  in addition to any future industry consolidation  may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete for customers as sole source vendors 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic alliances among themselves or with third parties  including some of our partners 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
competitive pressures we face could harm our business and operating results 
a detailed description of storage and software products we compete with is identified in the business section of this annual report on form k 
there have been trends toward consolidation in the storage industry and market expansion by large broad technology companies for several years  both of which have risks for us 
among other things  the last few years have witnessed considerable consolidation in the disk drive industry  an industry we depend upon for critical storage components 
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving  maturing industry  as companies become unable to maintain their competitive positions or continue operations and as customers demand more flexible business models and terms 
disk drive and other component manufacturing industry consolidations may lead to higher component prices and supply constraints for us  which may  in turn  harm our operating results 
our oem relationships may not generate significant revenues 
we have oem relationships with several companies  which collectively accounted for of our net revenue during the year ended april  these oems market and sell their branded solutions based on our unified solutions  as well as associated software offerings 
while these arrangements are part of our general strategy to expand our reach to more customers and into more countries  we do not have exclusive relationships with our oems  and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time 
we also compete with some of our oems  further complicating our relationships with them 
therefore  our relationships with these oems may not continue to generate significant revenues 
in addition  we have no control over the products that the oems select to sell  or their release schedule and timing of those products  nor do we control their pricing 
if our oem relationships increase  we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and the oems or among our channel partners 
if we fail to minimize channel conflicts  or if our oem relationships do not continue to generate significant revenues  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
a portion of our revenues is generated by large  recurring purchases from various customers  resellers and distributors 
a loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected in the past  and in the future could negatively affect  our revenues 
for the year ended april   sales to distributors arrow electronics  inc and avnet  inc 
accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenues 
we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers  resellers and distributors for extended periods of time  and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large  recurring orders from these customers  resellers or distributors 
for example  our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases  and our customers  resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time 
in addition  unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers  resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers  resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products 
if any of our key customers  resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices  reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products  or stops purchasing our products altogether  our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents reduced us government demand could materially harm our business and operating results 
in addition  we could be harmed by claims that we or a channel partner have failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the us government 
the us government has become an important customer for us 
however  government demand is uncertain  as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints 
recent and continued uncertainty regarding the us budget and debt levels has increased demand uncertainty for our products 
if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital it spending patterns  our revenues and operating results may be harmed 
selling our products to the us government  whether directly or through channel partners  also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations  fines  and other penalties  which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
as an example  the united states department of justice doj and the general services administration gsa have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors  including us and several of our competitors and channel partners  under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government 
although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us  we could face claims in the future 
violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting 
any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial position 
some of our products are subject to us export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold  distributed  or delivered  any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the global nature of our business  we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations  including the export administration regulations ear administered by the commerce department s bureau of industry and security bis and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac 
the us  through the bis and ofac  places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons 
violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties  which may include significant monetary fines  criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees  a denial of export privileges  and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government 
we take a variety of precautions to prevent our products from being shipped to us sanctioned targets  however  our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties  including potentially our channel partners  despite such precautions 
for instance  media reports starting in november have asserted that certain of our products were delivered to syria through a third party possibly in violation of us export control laws 
we have publicly stated that we condemn any use of our products or technologies in syria  we have notified the us government that we are conducting a review of these allegations  and intend to cooperate fully with any government inquiry 
we have met with us government officials  provided information at their request  and expressed our willingness to continue cooperating with any further inquiry or investigation 
if we are found to have violated us export control laws  we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws  any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial position 
even if we are not found to have violated such laws  the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant financial and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing our normal day to day operations  which could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial position 
if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners  our revenues may be harmed 
our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co market our products with 
table of contents them 
a detailed description of these partnership relationships is identified in the business section of this annual report 
a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management market 
however  there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners  and these relationships may not be exclusive  may not generate significant revenues and may terminate on short notice 
for instance some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors  which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners 
moreover  some of our partners  particularly large  more diversified technology companies  are also competitors  complicating our relationships 
if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships  if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us  we could experience lower than expected revenues  suffer delays in product development  or experience other harm to our operating results and business 
our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage industry may harm our business 
emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix  windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 
for example  we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services  healthcare  pharmaceutical and government market segments  industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access  reliability and permanence such as rule a of the securities exchange act of  as amended in the us and in the other countries in which we operate 
if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard  customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products  and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 
if our products are defective  our gross margins  operating results and customer relationships may be harmed 
our products are complex 
we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in the future  quality issues 
quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products  as we discuss in the next risk factor 
if we fail to remedy a product defect  we may experience a failure of a product line  temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market  damage to our reputation  inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs  and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins  business and operating results 
we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products  which could subject us to claims for damages  including consequential damages 
if we are unable to develop  introduce and gain market acceptance for clustered data ontap or other new products while managing the transition from older products  or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality  service and support for our new products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products 
due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products  such products are subject to significant technical and quality control risks 
we are currently devoting considerable effort and resources to develop  introduce and gain customer acceptance for our clustered data ontap based products cdot 
cdot is our next generation storage operating system for our core products and represents a fundamental and revolutionary change to our solution architecture 
over time  our goal is to replace our existing technology data ontap mode with cdot and  consequently  we anticipate that a majority of our revenues will ultimately derive from cdot 
we face considerable challenges as we develop and market cdot  including  without limitation  cost and complexity associated with migrating customer data and applications from legacy systems to cdot based systems  
table of contents development of some features for cdot currently available with data ontap and potentially required by our customers  and maintaining service  support and customer relationships as we replace data ontap with cdot 
nevertheless  if we are unable  for technological  customer reluctance or other reasons  to develop  introduce and gain market acceptance for cdot  or any other new products  as and when required by the market and our customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
new or additional product introductions also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues  and subject us to additional financial and operational risks 
in addition  as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers demands 
if these risks are not managed effectively  we could experience material risks to our operations  financial condition and business model 
as we enter new or emerging markets  we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition 
we may not be able to provide products  service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 
due to the global nature of our business  risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business 
a significant portion of our operations are located  and a significant portion of our revenues are derived  outside of the us for the year ended april   our international revenues accounted for of our total revenues 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us  and we have research and development and service centers overseas 
accordingly  our business and our future operating results could be adversely affected by factors affecting our international operations  but not experienced in the us  including  among other things  local political or economic conditions  trade protection and export and import requirements  local labor conditions  transportation costs  government spending patterns  acts of terrorism  international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure 
in addition  due to the global nature of our business  we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the us and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products  including antitrust and anti competition laws  rules and regulations  and regulations related to data privacy 
we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation  or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws 
such factors could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial position 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve  and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities as well as certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a short term basis 
our hedging strategies may not be successful  and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  our foreign currency exposure on assets and liabilities for which we do not hedge could have a material impact on our results of operations in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged non us currencies in which we transact business 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include  among others  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 
moreover  in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures  or us laws and regulations applicable to us  such as the foreign corrupt practices act 
there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business 
table of contents operations  will comply with these policies  procedures  laws and or regulations 
any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 
our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include among other things  fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business  and changes to the tax regulations in such jurisdictions 
any of these factors could materially impact our operating results 
we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non us customers 
these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the president s administration and congress have announced several proposals to reform us tax rules  including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of us income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings 
should such anti deferral provisions be enacted  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected 
we are currently undergoing income tax audits in the us and several foreign tax jurisdictions  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the rights to some of our intellectual property ip are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries  and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement 
in recent years  several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of internal revenue service irs examinations  which have resulted in material proposed assessments and or litigation with respect to those companies 
if the ultimate determination of income taxes or at source withholding taxes assessed under the current irs audits or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands which expires on april  and results in a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the netherlands 
if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling  our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations  which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole 
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 
our convertible note conversion may adversely affect our results of operations  particularly our earnings per share 
any conversion of the convertible notes may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share 
if the average trading price of our common stock in each fiscal quarter exceeds the conversion price of per share  the convertible notes will cause an increase in diluted share count and result in lower reported earnings per share 
the convertible note hedge transactions discussed below  if exercised upon conversion of the convertible notes  are expected to reduce approximately of the common stock potentially issuable on conversion of the convertible notes 
upon conversion of any convertible notes  we are required to deliver cash 
table of contents up to the principal amount of the convertible notes and  with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes  shares of our common stock  which will result in dilution to our stockholders 
as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements  in june we issued million shares in connection with the settlement of the convertible notes and received million shares in connection with the exercise of the convertible note hedges 
the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the convertible notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the counterparties  which are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes 
at the same time  we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price 
in connection with these hedging transactions  the counterparties may have entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the convertible notes 
the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions 
additionally  these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes will depend  in part  on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in addition  if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants  there could be additional dilution to our stockholders  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading price of the convertible notes and warrants 
as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements  in june we exercised the convertible note hedges and settled our convertible notes 
future issuances of common stock related to our convertible notes  warrants and employee equity awards may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the convertible notes 
the conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes 
any new issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the convertible notes or the exercise of related warrants which are not offset by our convertible note hedges  could dilute the interests of our then existing stockholders  including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their convertible notes  and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the convertible notes 
in addition  any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion or the exercise of warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements  in june we issued million shares in connection with the settlement of the convertible notes and received million shares in connection with the exercise of the convertible note hedges 
our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 
our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to  among other things  our financial position and results of operations  available cash and cash flow  capital requirements  and other factors 
any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

table of contents moreover  in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued  our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our stock 
our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits  increase our liabilities  disrupt our existing business and harm our results of operations 
as part of our strategy  we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  or enhance our technical capabilities 
in fiscal  we completed acquisitions of two technology companies 
in fiscal  we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to engenio  and in fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of cacheiq and iongrid 
the benefits we expect to receive from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence  negotiate the terms of acquisition and integrate the acquired business 
any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions  any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition  any failure to make the acquisition on favorable terms  or any failure to integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected  may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us  increase our costs  disrupt our operations  result in additional liabilities  investigations and litigation  and may also harm our strategy  our results of operations or our business 
the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates  impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities 
if global credit experiences prolonged periods of decline  or if there is a downgrade of us government debt  our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value  requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 
for a summary of these investments and our management of the same  please see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this document 
we are exposed to the credit and non payment risk of our customers  resellers  and distributors  especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets  which could result in material losses 
most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis  with typical payment terms of days 
while we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements  and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe are reasonable  we may experience losses due to a customer s inability to pay 
beyond our open credit arrangements  some of our customers have entered into recourse and nonrecourse financing leasing arrangements using third party leasing companies 
under the terms of recourse leases  which are generally three years or less  we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third party leasing companies in the event of end user customer default 
we expect demand for customer financing to continue 
during periods of economic uncertainty  our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases 
in addition  our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions 
in the past  there have been bankruptcies by our customers to whom we had extended open credit  provided lease financing arrangements or guaranteed lease payments under full recourse lease arrangements 
such events have caused us to incur bad debt charges  in the case of financing arrangements have caused a loss of revenues  and in the case of recourse lease arrangements have caused us to make payments to third party financers 
we 
table of contents may be subject to similar losses in future periods 
any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  to the extent that the continuing turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing  those customers ability to purchase our products could be adversely impacted  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
any repatriation of our overseas cash to fund us operations  strategic opportunities or debt service may subject us to a significant tax liability 
as of april   billion of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were held in foreign countries 
under current law  dividend repatriation of any of this cash would trigger significant adverse tax consequences in the us as a result  if the cash generated by our domestic operations is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations  our broader corporate initiatives  such as stock repurchases  dividends  acquisitions  and other strategic opportunities  and to service our outstanding indebtedness  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash 
such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders ownership 
furthermore  lenders may not agree to extend us new  additional or continuing credit 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to repatriate our foreign held cash and incur a significant tax expense 
in any such case  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 
if we default under our significant debt obligations  including our convertible notes and senior notes  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
moreover  covenants associated with our convertible notes and senior notes may unduly restrict our business 
we have convertible notes outstanding in the principal amount of billion that mature on june  and senior notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of billion that mature at specific dates in calendar and we have also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million  under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april  we may fail to pay these obligations  as and when required 
specifically  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
as discussed in the subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements  in june we repaid the principal amount of our convertible notes 
in addition  our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements  we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements 
moreover  compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur asset impairment and restructuring charges in response to changing market conditions or cost cutting initiatives 
we may undertake cost savings initiatives in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products 
these initiatives may include restructuring  disposing of  and or otherwise discontinuing certain products  or both 
any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with  among other things  inventory or other fixed  intangible or goodwill asset reductions including  without limitation  impairment charges  workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third party resellers or users of discontinued products 
these charges would harm our operating results 
we have previously recognized restructuring and other charges associated with these activities 
in addition to the costs associated with these activities  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the same 

table of contents we could be harmed if we fail to manage our growth 
while we have historically grown rapidly  primarily through organic initiatives our acquisition activity has been ongoing and we expect to continue to look for opportunities to supplement our organic growth through strategic initiatives 
our growth has at times led to both organizational change and strain 
we may continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change  which may continue to place significant demands on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
we incur significant expenditures of funds and the allocation of management and other resources to manage our growth and assimilate new human resources in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture and our reputation in the marketplace 
we may experience periods when our pace of growth exceeds the capacity and capabilities of our organization and systems 
if we do not effectively manage our growth through cost effective organizational and system programs  our corporate culture could be undermined  the quality of our products and customer service could suffer  and our reputation could be harmed  each of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure  business processes and systems more efficient  including by moving activities from higher cost to lower cost locations  outsourcing certain business processes and functions  and implementing new business information systems 
problems with the execution of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient  including by moving our business activities from higher cost to lower cost locations  outsourcing certain business processes and functions  and implementing changes to our business information systems 
these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes 
in addition  as we move operations into lower cost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes  we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and  as a consequence  become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of third parties 
if we are unable to move our operations  outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards  controls and procedures  the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk  either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business and operating results could be harmed 
our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers 
competition for qualified employees  particularly in silicon valley  is intense 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees  particularly our engineers  salespeople and key managers  could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs 
if we reduce or eliminate our equity programs  due to increased shareholder activism  heightened focus on corporate compensation practices  or increased scrutiny of the dilutive effects of such programs  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees 
in addition  because of the structure of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans  we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times 
for example  the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards 

table of contents our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster  terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 
we depend on the ability of our personnel  raw materials  equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world 
any political  military  terrorism  global trade  world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions 
furthermore  any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters  including fires  floods  hurricanes  earthquakes  and volcanoes  power loss or shortages  environmental disasters  telecommunications or business information systems failures or break ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions  or impair our ability to meet our customer demands  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our headquarters and one of our major data centers are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
if any significant disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business and our financial condition could be impaired 
our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends significantly upon developing  maintaining and protecting proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees  resellers  strategic partners and customers  to protect our proprietary rights 
we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us and international patents issued 
the pending applications may not be approved  and our existing and future patents may be challenged 
if such challenges are brought  the patents may be invalidated 
we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties 
further  the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business 
in addition  a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
any such litigation may be time consuming and costly 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims 
we may  from time to time  receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
third parties may in the future  claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products  patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights 
we expect that companies in the network storage and data management market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products  or enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

table of contents changes in regulations relating to our products or their components  or the manufacture  sourcing  distribution or use thereof  may harm our business and operating results 
the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing  sourcing  distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time 
for example  in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials  the sec has recently adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries 
we may incur costs to comply with the new disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products 
further  since our supply chain is complex  we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell 
as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change  our costs are likely to rise  and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions  litigation risks and reputational harm 
if a data center or other third party who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data  such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products  thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business 
our clients including data centers  saas  cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers rely on our products for their data storage needs 
we exercise little control over how our clients use or maintain our products  and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products 
our clients may authorize third party technology providers to access their data on our systems 
because we do not control the transmissions between our clients  their customers  and third party technology providers  or the processing of such data by third party technology providers  we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing 
errors or wrongdoing by clients  their customers  or third party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us 
a failure or inability to meet our clients expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these third party vendors  or the loss of data stored by such vendors  could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by  or perceived by our customers to have been caused by  defects in our products 
moreover  the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet  including through news articles  blogs  chat rooms  and social media sites 
this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business 
if our security measures are breached or if stored data is improperly accessed  customers may reduce or cease using our solutions  our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities 
we store and transmit sensitive and proprietary data related to our employees  clients and partners including third party vendors such as data centers and providers of saas  cloud computing  and internet infrastructure and bandwidth  and their respective customers  including intellectual property  books of record and personally identifiable information 
security breaches could result in unauthorized access to  or loss or unauthorized disclosure of  such information  litigation  indemnity obligations  government investigations and other possible liabilities  as well as negative publicity  which could damage our reputation 
additionally  our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data 
we do not regularly monitor or review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store  and  therefore  we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms 
therefore  if employees  clients  partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive information and our security measures are breached as a result of third 
table of contents party action  employee error  malfeasance  stolen or fraudulently obtained log in credentials or otherwise  our reputation could be damaged  our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand  we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems 
many jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data 
these mandatory disclosures regarding security breaches often lead to widespread negative publicity 
moreover  the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet  including through news articles  blogs  chat rooms  and social media sites 
any security breach  whether actual or perceived  could harm our reputation  erode client confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures  negatively impact our ability to attract new clients  cause existing clients to elect not to renew their support contracts  or subject us to third party lawsuits  regulatory fines or other action or liability  which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim 
our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or our insurer may deny coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage  or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements  the increased use of fair value measures  changes to revenue recognition  lease accounting  financial instruments and other accounting standards  and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs  could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
implementation of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue  which may affect our results of operations
