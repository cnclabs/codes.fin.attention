item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 
the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new and improved products  our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer 
even if we are able to develop new or improved products  our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance  restrictions imposed on approved indications  entrenched patterns of clinical practice  uncertainty over third party reimbursement or other factors 
we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities  however  the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty 
accordingly  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 
technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability 
we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products  they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development  and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 
we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients 
in addition  many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time 
component failures  manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to  or death of  patients 
such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims  safety alerts or product recalls in the future  which  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 
product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class 
we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges  including the establishment of any such reserves  could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

table of contents we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 
we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products 
our surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man made materials 
our non implantable products are manufactured from man made raw materials including resins  chemicals  electronics and metals 
we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers  and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance  cost effectiveness  availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 
general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers  resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products 
while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability  these efforts may not be successful 
in addition  due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements  we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises 
although alternative supplier options are considered and identified  we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 
a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology  and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 
regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products 
in these circumstances  transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials 
in addition  the sec recently enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo 
if our suppliers cannot certify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas  we may need to source components from alternative suppliers 
if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner  our business could be harmed 
some of our suppliers are located outside the united states 
as a result  trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 
the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls 
if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems  our business could suffer 
the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls  due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements 
in addition  quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure 
problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons  including equipment malfunction  failure to follow protocols and procedures  raw material problems or human error 
if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body  which include detailed record keeping requirements  our reputation could be damaged  we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall  we could incur product liability and other costs  product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

table of contents we may be required  from time to time  to recognize charges in connection with the write down of our investments  asset or business dispositions  or for other reasons 
we have equity investments in other companies  and we may make similar investments in the future 
to the extent that the value of any of these investments declines  we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment 
at december   we had million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 
in addition  from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business 
we may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products 
we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons 
if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms  we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product 
any of these events could result in charges  which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances  and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures  require significant management resources and require significant charges or write downs 
we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies  services or products  as well as potential strategic alliances 
we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances 
even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates  we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 
we may be required to take charges or write downs in connection with acquisitions 
in particular  acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in process research and development assets 
to the extent that the value of these assets declines  we may be required to write down the value of the assets 
also  in connection with certain asset acquisitions  we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired in process research and development 
either of these situations could result in substantial charges  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets  any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 
general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition 
such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions  such as interest rates  tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability  and the political environment regarding health care in general 
while the economic environment has shown some signs of improvement  the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain  and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact our business 
for example  negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds  and could negatively impact our 
table of contents ability to borrow 
an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets 
such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments  and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers  and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 
in  significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states 
the law includes provisions that  among other things  reduce or limit medicare reimbursement  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes 
specifically  the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in the excise tax will increase our operating expenses 
because many other parts of the health care law remain subject to implementation  the long term impact on us is uncertain 
the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes  lower reimbursement for the company products  and impact the demand for the company products or the prices at which the company sells its products 
for example  the budget control act of  which provided an increase to the united states debt limit  imposed significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade 
this measure and other such deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and prospects if they were to result in cuts to  or a restructuring of  entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
we do business with governments outside the united states 
a number of these countries  including certain european countries  have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions 
these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries 
in addition  we have been and may continue to be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries 
our business is subject to economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations  including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because we sell our products in a number of countries  our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally  including risks associated with united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act as well as with the united kingdom bribery act and anti corruption laws in other jurisdictions 
our net sales originating outside of the united states  as a percentage of total net sales  were in we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs  changes in foreign regulatory requirements  changes in a specific country or region political or economic conditions  such as the current financial uncertainties in europe and changing circumstances in emerging regions  trade protection measures  quotas  embargoes  import or export licensing requirements and duties  tariffs or surcharges  potentially negative impact of tax laws  including tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash  difficulty in staffing and managing global operations  cultural  exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers  
table of contents local economic and financial conditions affecting the collectability of receivables  including receivables from sovereign entities  an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease  economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions  differing labor regulations  and differing protection of intellectual property 
substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies 
measured in local currency  a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan 
the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen  as well as other currencies  have the opposite effect and  if significant  could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations 
we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and cost  however  this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the united states foreign corrupt practices act  the united kingdom bribery act  and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments 
recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws 
although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws  no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found  and if found  the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 
the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline 
from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating results 
in addition  the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below  as well as a number of other factors  including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry  or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 
our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter  and the price of our common stock could fall 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include announcements of innovations  new products  strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors  demand for and clinical acceptance of products  the timing and execution of customer contracts  particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter  the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products  the timing or marketing  training  and other expenses related to the introduction of new products  
table of contents the timing of regulatory approvals  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  delays or problems in introducing new products  such as slower than anticipated adoption of transcatheter heart valves  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  raw materials or supplies  product development or administration  changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  and our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion related expenditures 
we face intense competition  and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 
the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive 
we compete with many companies  some of which have longer operating histories  better brand or name recognition  and broader product offerings 
our customers consider many factors when selecting a product  including product reliability  breadth of product line  clinical outcomes  product availability  price  availability and rate of reimbursement  and services provided by the manufacturer 
in addition  our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies  anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies 
our sales  technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development  marketing and selling of new and existing products 
if we are unable to recruit  hire  develop and retain a talented  competitive work force  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems  physician advisories and safety alerts  reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry 
our position can shift as a result of any of these factors 
see competition under business included herein 
consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos  independent delivery networks  and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration  continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers 
as a result  transactions with customers are larger  more complex  and tend to involve more long term contracts 
the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased  and may continue to increase  causing downward pressure on product pricing 
if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations  we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants 
even if we are one of the selected providers  we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies 
further  we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that market demand  governmental regulation  third party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry  resulting in further business consolidations and alliances  which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property  and we expect to continue to do so 
although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means  we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights 
patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid 
in addition  as our patents expire  we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions 
the expiration of  or the failure to maintain or extend our patents  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees  consultants and other third parties to protect  in part  trade secrets and other proprietary information 
these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach 
in addition  others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 
we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights  sometimes resulting in litigation 
intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time consuming 
however  our efforts in this regard may not be successful 
we may not be able to detect infringement 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort 
intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  enabling our competitors to capture increased market position 
the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 
during recent years  we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
from time to time  we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time consuming 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions  or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and  if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms  prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using certain products  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  some licenses may be non exclusive  which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 
third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or  if possible  negotiate licenses from such third parties 
such licenses may materially increase our expenses 
if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license  we might have to exit a particular product offering 
we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations 
in addition  failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities  including regulations that cover the composition  labeling  testing  clinical study  design  sourcing  manufacturing  packaging  marketing  advertising  promotion and distribution of our products 
we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer 
as a result  we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda quality system regulation qsr requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including 
table of contents testing  design  quality control and documentation procedures 
the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting  recalls or corrections field actions  the conduct of clinical studies  and other requirements 
in the european union  we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products  and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr  ce mark  iso or similar requirements  this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and or lead to fines  difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances  recalls or other consequences  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 
medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized  and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post marketing programs 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda 
furthermore  most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance  approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed 
the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device  particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities  can be costly and time consuming  and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects 
at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale  the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements  and or current medical device reporting regulations  or other regulatory requirements 
noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject the company or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties  product seizure  injunction  or criminal prosecution 
additionally  product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing and fraud and abuse  including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources 
these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation  which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance 
violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against the company and our officers and employees  including substantial fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 
despite our implementation of robust compliance processes  we may be subject  from time to time  to inspections  investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities 
if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations  the applicable governmental authority can impose fines  delay  suspend  or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals  institute proceedings to detain or seize our products  issue a recall  impose marketing or operating restrictions  enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees  and institute criminal prosecution 
moreover  governmental authorities can ban or request the recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute 
any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above  commencement of an enforcement proceeding  inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities  which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 
in recent years  the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny  including by the fda  numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities  as well as members of congress 
this has included increased regulation  enforcement  inspections  and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals 
we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely  and that additional regulation by governmental authorities  both foreign and domestic  may increase compliance costs  exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 
unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 
the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures  including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us  our competitors  or third parties  or perceptions regarding this clinical data  could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market view of our future prospects 
such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner or result in a commercially viable product 
failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 
clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results 
further  preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis 
in addition  results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long term studies or clinical experience 
if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted  or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long term studies or clinical experience  our business could be adversely affected 
clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us  the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
we are subject to risks arising from concerns and or regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 
certain of our products  including pericardial tissue valves  are manufactured using bovine tissue 
concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse  commonly known as mad cow disease  from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials 
certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material 
we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia 
the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent 
we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse  but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 
if third party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels  our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 
we sell our products and technologies to hospitals  doctors and other health care providers  all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third party payors  such as government programs both domestic and international  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies 
the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay 
reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

table of contents third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement  if any  will not be decreased in the future  or that future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products 
the introduction of cost containment incentives  combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers  has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed 
hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies 
in addition  the united states health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products  or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 
initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs  including price regulation  are underway in several countries around the world 
in many countries  customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system 
under such a system  the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access 
if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels  our product pricing could be adversely affected 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by such third party payors  or was used for an unapproved indication 
third party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices 
we believe that many of our existing products are cost effective  even though the one time cost may be significant  because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time 
we cannot be certain that these third party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies 
if our products are not considered cost effective by third party payors  our customers may not be reimbursed for them  resulting in lower sales of our products 
use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 
the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are  or are expected to be  limited to specific indications 
we are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products 
physicians  however  can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval 
although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials  no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 
our operations are subject to environmental  health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 
our operations are subject to environmental  health and safety laws  and regulations concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes  the cleanup of hazardous substance releases  and emissions or discharges into the air or water 
we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental  health and safety laws  and regulations 
new laws and regulations  violations of these laws or regulations  stricter enforcement of existing requirements  or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 
the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 
the development  marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience 
these physicians may assist us as researchers  marketing consultants  product trainers and consultants  inventors and as public speakers 
if new laws  regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong 
table of contents relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input  the development and marketing of our products could suffer  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

overview edwards lifesciences corporation is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients 
a pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products  edwards lifesciences is the world leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient diseased or defective heart valve 
the company is also a global leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient cardiovascular function in the hospital setting 

table of contents during the first quarter of  the company began reporting its products and technologies in three new product groups surgical heart valve therapy  which combines surgical heart valves and cardiac surgery systems  transcatheter heart valves  and critical care  which includes vascular 
sales amounts for the prior year periods have been recast to conform with the new product classifications 
edwards lifesciences surgical heart valve therapy portfolio is comprised primarily of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products for the surgical replacement or repair of a patient heart valve 
the portfolio also includes a diverse line of products used during minimally invasive surgical procedures  and cannulae  embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass 
the company transcatheter heart valves portfolio includes technologies designed to treat heart valve disease using catheter based approaches as opposed to open surgical techniques 
in the critical care portfolio  edwards lifesciences products include pulmonary artery catheters  disposable pressure transducers and advanced monitoring systems 
the portfolio also includes a line of balloon catheter based vascular products  surgical clips and inserts 
the health care marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors 
the company competes with many companies  ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger with broader product offerings than edwards lifesciences 
furthermore  rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the company competes 
global demand for health care is increasing as the population ages 
there is mounting pressure to contain health care costs in the face of this increasing demand  which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures 
the cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic  and technology  cost of care considerations  regulatory reform  industry and customer consolidation  and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change 
in  significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states 
the law includes provisions that  among other things  reduce or limit medicare reimbursement  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes 
specifically  the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in the excise tax will increase the company operating expenses 
because many other parts of the health care law remain subject to implementation  the long term impact on the company is uncertain 
the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes  lower reimbursement for the company products  and impact the demand for the company products or the prices at which the company sells its products

certain of the company accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates

management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product  provided that an agreement of sale exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry  with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer  limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for rebates  returns and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels  and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers 
product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity  the company financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted

this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor 
the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor inventory 
this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates 
the company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated

the company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
the credit and economic conditions within italy  spain  portugal and greece  among other members of the european union  have deteriorated as these countries have experienced slower economic growth and higher debt levels 
when evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to these european receivables  the company analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer ability to comply with credit terms  economic conditions and procedures implemented by the company to collect the historical receivables 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively

as a result of on going negotiations of an advanced pricing agreement  the expiration of statutes of limitations  and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world  the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next months 
the range of such change could vary  but the amount of such change is not expected to be material
