see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements at the beginning of this report on form k for additional discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties 
unless the context requires otherwise  when we refer to we  us and our  we are describing arc group worldwide  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
arc business overview arc is a diversified  global manufacturing company 
arc s mission is to bring innovation to traditional manufacturing 
arc seeks to accomplish this through building technologically advanced  niche manufacturing businesses in the us and abroad 
arc views the coming resurgence of us manufacturing as a significant opportunity  through the advent  and continued adoption of automation  robotics  artificial intelligence and lower domestic energy prices 
however  arc continues to seek opportunities both in the developed and developing world  in order to adapt to the global manufacturing supply chain as it continues to evolve 
arc is focused on building its core manufacturing businesses in precision components  flanges  fittings and wireless equipment 
the company focuses on building these units through organic growth  as well as vertical and horizontal acquisitions 
in addition to making acquisitions that are strategic to arc  the company will continue to evaluate new manufacturing niches that fit into its broader objectives  which are bringing manufacturing back to the us  bringing technology to traditional manufacturing  as well as optimally position the company within the global manufacturing supply chain 
arc operates three reportable segments the precision components group  consisting of flomet  aft us  aft hungary  and teknaseal llc  the flanges and fittings group  consisting of general flange forge llc  and the wireless group  consisting of arc wireless llc and arc wireless ltd 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company made the decision to discontinue the operations of tubefit  which was previously included within its flanges fittings segment 
the operations of tubefit have been included in our consolidated statement of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
precision components group the precision component industry is comprised of a number of significant industries commonly defined by the process and or type of metal utilized to manufacture the component 
common processes include casting  forging  machining  stamping  powder metallurgy conventional p m metal injection molding mim  and powder forging and extrusion 
mim is a metallurgical fabrication process that allows complex parts to be produced in quantity and at a lower cost than comparable machining or other metalworking processes 
the mim process can be utilized to produce parts in a range of alloys including carbon and low alloy steels  stainless steels  magnetic materials  copper  and exotic alloys such as inconel and titanium 
the worldwide market for precision metal components is believed to total hundreds of billions of dollars annually 
the precision components group companies participate in several significant metal component fabrication market segments providing high quality fabricated metal components and the hermetic sealing of certain components to market leading companies in some of the fastest growing industries  among them medical devices  firearms  automotive  consumer durables  and electronic devices 
the combination of flomet  aft us  and aft hu provide the market the broadest range of technical and manufacturing in the metal injection molding industry globally 
since the transaction close date of august  the companies have focused on integration of certain shared services and sharing of best practices amongst the three manufacturing sites 
we have combined sales and marketing activities at the segment level to provide our customers with the broadest range of capabilities in the mim industry 
revenues for the precision components group  which also includes our hermetic sealing specialist  teknaseal  grew vs 
the same period in the prior year  primarily due to the acquisitions of the two aft companies 
segment operating income grew vs 
the year earlier period as the segment incurred certain costs associated with the acquisition and severance costs associated with the integration efforts 
year over year results for all three mim companies showed improved ebitda over the similar periods prior to the reverse merger and acquisitions 
these increases were due to significant revenue increases at aft us as demand from their customers  primarily in the firearms market segment  continued to grow through the year 
improved operating efficiencies associated with our intensive continuous improvement efforts resulted in significantly improved operating earnings at all three mim companies  particularly at aft hungary 
demand in the firearms industry continues at record levels for our customers as well as for aft us  and we are adding capacity to accommodate this growth which we expect to continue through fiscal year the segment also received significant new tooling orders from a medical device company that is an industry leader in robotic surgery techniques 
the mim group also received a record number of new tooling orders in the year representing some m in incremental revenue at anticipated production volumes 
the strength of the combined mim companies in materials technology was responsible for several new production and pre production developmental orders from the aerospace market  including the first mim part to be utilized in a space launch vehicle 
additional development work in implantable grades of mim materials should result in several significant future orders for major orthopedic companies 
teknaseal  the leader in several demanding hermetic sealing and implantable battery feed through applications saw positive indications across its markets as orders for new prototype applications reached record levels 
prototypes typically represent future production orders commencing between one and three years from original submission 
teknaseal s major customer  an aerospace instrument company was sold in the year and also moved production facilities  but normal levels of production resumed in the second half of our fiscal year and the strong backlog for new commercial airplanes indicates robust order levels going forward 
flange and fittings group gf f is one of approximately domestic flange manufacturers in the united states  and the only one on the east coast 
gf f has been in business since the majority of flange manufacturers are in the south west 
gf f is a very customer driven and service oriented company 
gf f estimates that the domestic market  combining carbon  stainless and alloy flanges  is more than a billion dollars 
gf f s business model is focused on converting foreign purchased alloy steel and stainless steel forgings into domestic flanges via value added processing to provide a finished component with sufficient domestic content to qualify as domestically produced 
gf f also sells foreign produced finished flanges for certain applications 
additionally  gf f will purchase forgings produced in the us and europe and machine them into finished flanges for high integrity applications 
gf f s revenues were negatively impacted in the fiscal year by hurricane sandy with the resulting devastation of the east coast its primary market for flanges and its infrastructure having a continuing impact through the fiscal year 
we have seen robust demand returning in the later months of the year  particularly from our instrumentation customers 
gf f is also working closely with a european forging supplier to develop a line of higher pressure rated flanges for applications in refineries and fracking operations which has been growing strongly in parts of the northeast 
wireless group the wireless group focuses on wireless broadband technology related to propagation and optimization 
it designs and develops hardware  including antennas  radios  and related accessories  used in broadband and other wireless networks 
products are sold to public and private carriers  wireless infrastructure providers  wireless equipment distributors  value added resellers and other original equipment manufacturers 
growth in product revenue is dependent on market acceptance of the new products  in development now and products already released  to support our wireless initiatives 
revenue growth for the products is correlated to the overall global wireless market and to the ability to take market share from our competitors 
the group focuses on keeping our operational and general costs low in order to improve margins 
specific growth areas are last mile wireless broadband internet delivered over standards based solutions such as worldwide interoperability for microwave access wimax  wifi or vendor specific proprietary solutions  gps and mobile satcom solutions for network timing  fleet and asset tracking and monitoring  machine to machine mm communications for controlling or monitoring data from devices  and base stations to build out or optimize carrier networks 
discontinued operations tubefit tubefit s operations consisted of distribution of import fittings and both import and domestic flanges 
tubefit served a segment of the market called the general commodity welds fitting and flange market 
tubefit is no longer actively operating and the assets and liabilities of tubefit are presented as discontinued operations in the company financial statements as of june  and and the results of operation are presented as discontinued operations for the years ended june  and at its net realizable value 
arc s financial condition as of june  the company had total assets of million  consisting of total current assets of million  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  of million  and total long term assets of million 
in comparison  as of june  the company had total assets of million  consisting of total current assets of million  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation of million  and total long term assets of million 
the significant increase of million in total assets is mainly attributed to the fair value of assets acquired in the qmt and aft acquisitions discussed in note a to the financial statements 
at june  and the company had working capital of million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital was primarily driven by million on incremental working capital associated with the acquisition excluding cash  in addition to million increase in current year working capital driven largely by cash  which is offset with the million of additional current debt in liabilities associated with the acquisition 
at june   the company s total current assets of million consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  of million  inventory of million  prepaid expenses and other assets of million and current assets of discontinued operations of million 
total current liabilities of million consisted of current portion of long term debt in the amount of million  line of credit of million  accounts payable and accrued liabilities million and deferred revenue of million 
the company s total current assets of million as of june   consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  inventory of million  a related party receivable of million  prepaid expenses and other assets of million  and current assets of discontinued operations of million 
total current liabilities of million consisted of current portion of long term debt in the amount of million  accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  deferred revenue of million and a related party payable of million 
as of june   long term assets consisted of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles in the amount of million  and million in other assets 
as of june  long term assets consisted of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles in the amount of million  million in other assets and million in assets of discontinued operations 
the increase in goodwill and other intangibles is attributed to million in intangibles related to the acquisition of aft and million of intangibles related to the reverse acquisition of arc 
these increases are offset by a million asset reduction related to discontinued operations attributed to tubefit s non current assets at net realizable value 
the company s total liabilities and stockholders equity were million and million  respectively  as of june  in comparison  as of june  the company s total liabilities and members equity were million and million  respectively 
the increase in total liabilities was primarily attributed to the increase in total debt as the result of the acquisition 
the change in stockholders equity was driven by the increase in additional paid in capital  due to reverse acquisition accounting for the predecessor company s investment in arc 
results of operations for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   the company s total sales were million  and other income including the gain on bargain purchase of million 
in comparison  total sales were million for the fiscal year june  and 
million of other income 
the increase in sales of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  is primarily attributed to incremental sales volume as a result of the acquisition of arc and aft  on august  increased demand in the firearms market has also positively impacted the company s sales revenue 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company s total cost of sales and operating expenses were million  including cost of sales of million  selling  general and administrative expenses of million  and merger expenses of million 
for the fiscal year ended june   total cost of sales and operating expenses were million  including cost of sales of million and selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company s other income included million in gains on the bargain purchase of arc offset by interest and miscellaneous expense of million  for the fiscal year ended june  the company had other expense of million attributable to interest expense  offset with other income of million 
the cost of sales and operating expense increase over prior year is attributed to the acquisition of aft and arc on august  resulting in million of additional cost of sales and operating expenses for acquired manufacturing volume and million of merger expenses 
the million increase in other expense is primarily attributed to million in non cash interest discount amortization associated with the convertible debt 
the company s net income before non controlling interest for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to earnings before non controlling interest for the fiscal year ended june  of million 
the earnings before non controlling interest decreased over the prior year due to decreased net income attributed to initial merger and acquisitions costs 
the net income as of june  excluding merger expenses and the gain on bargain purchase is million 
in addition  in fiscal year the company incurred million in non cash interest discount amortization associated with the convertible debt  million in non cash amortization related to the other identifiable intangibles resulting from the acquisition  and million in tax expense under the corporation structure with positive domestic and foreign income 
the tax and amortization expenses of million are differences to prior year net income in that they were not part of the fiscal year cost structure 
income allocated to the company s non controlling interest was million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   the company s net income attributable to arc was million compared to million in net income for the fiscal year ended june  as noted above  the reductions in net earnings for the fiscal year ended june  over the fiscal year ended june  were primarily due to million of expenses regarding merger expenses  non cash interest and intangible amortization  and tax expense 
changes in cash flows operating cash flow net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year ended june  was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities increased primarily due to the growth in the business via the acquisition of aft and maintaining the healthy cash flows of qmt 
the income from continuing operations factored with the adjustments for the reconciling non cash items in the cash flow statement  result in million and million for fiscal years and  respectively of income adjusted for non cash transactions 
in addition  the cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
however this was offset by the less cash used in discontinued operations in fiscal year over prior year 
some drivers of the positive cash flow from net operating asset liabilities is a result of improved inventory turns through better management of order quantities and reductions in accounts receivable from heavy collection efforts 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated by operations and cash available from our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next months 
investing cash flow cash flows used in investing activities were million and million in fiscal years ending june  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ending june   our investing cash flows primarily consist of million in net assets acquired as part of the acquisition of aft  million in net cash acquired in the qmt and aft acquisitions  million in capital expenditures to purchase manufacturing equipment to support production offset by stock issued for cash of million and million cash provided by the sale of assets post acquisition 
for the fiscal year ending june  our investment activities primarily consisted of million of equipment purchased to support production and million of cash used in net assets acquired of tubefit 
financing cash flow cash flows provided in financing activities were million in fiscal year as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of million 
our primary financing activity in fiscal year was financing for the aft acquisition 
the proceeds from issuance of debt amounted to approximately million and million was used for current year debt payments of million and the settlement of prior qmt debt of million  million was used to pay distributions to members and non controlling interests 
for fiscal year million was provided by the issuance of debt and million was used as a repayment of debt  million was used to pay distributions to members and non controlling interests 
as of june   we had approximately million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries 
this cash is maintained and reinvested in the foreign operations 
if cash is to be repatriated in the future from these foreign subsidiaries  the company could be subject to additional income taxes payable in the us debt and credit arrangements on august   qmt entered into an agreement with td bank  na for a million credit facility to fund the purchase advanced forming technology inc and aft hungary kft  and to pay off the balances of outstanding loans held as of that date 
for further details please reference note e long term debt of our consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k 
as of june   we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit agreements 
in addition  on august  a convertible note payable to precision castparts in the amount of million was issued with a five year maturity 
the convertible note is subordinated to the first priority security interest of td bank  na under the terms of the convertible note  the holder may at any time prior to maturity subject to certain restrictions convert the convertible note into newly issued shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price equal to the day average trading value per share of the company s common stock immediately preceding conversion  provided that the convertible note may be converted only if it converts into less than of the common ownership of the company and the equity value of the company is not less than million 
off balance sheet arrangements there are currently no off balance sheet arrangements that are  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements

the increase resulted from the post acquisition sales activity along with opportunities to expand in both the automotive and firearms market as a result of acquiring aft and aft hu 
the firearms market segment at aft continued to grow strongly as the company was able to meet increased demand and secure several new programs from their customers in this growing market segment 
sales at aft hu to their automotive turbocharger customers reflected the increasing demand for turbochargers in cars as engine displacements continue to shrink to meet increasing fuel economy requirements 
turbochargers enable the automakers to downsize engines while improving performance thus providing customers with a relatively transparent solution to improved fuel efficiency without sacrificing power 
the additional operating costs resulting from the acquisition translated into segment cost increase of or million over prior year 
this increase is also attributed to lower historical margin levels at aft and aft hu due to higher material costs as a percentage of sales and certain manufacturing inefficiencies offset by a large number of continuous improvement programs and price increases to certain customers 
the operating companies have implemented additional cost reduction and continuous improvement activities to maintain and improve margins  and aggressively implemented price increase opportunities with certain customers to offset increases in raw materials and other operating costs 
additionally  we expect demand in europe for automotive turbochargers to continue its strong growth patterns which should translate into increased revenues at aft hu 
the precision components segment experienced a slight slowdown in demand in several important market segments such as medical devices although the demand in the firearms and automotive segment has offset the negative impact on revenues 
we anticipate the negative impact on revenue of the current years slowing economy to stabilize in the upcoming year 
flanges fittings flanges and fittings sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to sales of million for the fiscal year ended june  segment operating costs income was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
segment operating income was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the reduction in revenues and operating income reflects the impact of the slowing in the general economy in the year 
also  our customer base in the northeast us was affected and is gradually recovering from the impact of hurricane sandy 
additionally  during fiscal year the decision was made to discontinue operations of tubefit due to the subsidiary s continuing inability to generate adequate sales volume and positive income as a result of significant price competition in the southwest us geographic market 
we have made certain cost reductions in our general flange operation to reduce our operating costs as the northeast recovers and demand in that geographic market improves as reconstruction projects get underway with the improved weather in the area 
as with our precision components segment  the flanges fittings segment is witnessing a slight slowdown in overall demand from its customers due to the sluggish us economy 
however  we remain optimistic about the overall prospects of the flanges fittings industry 
the increasing attention on energy  chemical manufacturing  food processing  and other industries requiring flow management all appear to position general flange and forge for future growth 
gf f is focused on continuing to expand its customer base in  particularly with the instrumentation market segment and the energy segment by marketing flanges rated for higher pressure applications than current product lines 
wireless wireless sales were million for the year ended june  segment operating loss was million or as a percent of segment sales  for the year ended june  during fiscal year cost reduction efforts were implemented for arc wireless to minimize the operating losses and structure the organization for improved operating performance going forward 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
policies determined to be critical are those that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of sales tax  trade discounts and customer returns 
the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectability is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  the company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company uses the allowance method to account for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the allowance is sufficient to cover both current and anticipated future losses 
uncollectible amounts are charged against the allowance account 
management estimates this amount based upon prior experience with customers and an analysis of individual trade accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of inventories the company values inventories at the lower of average cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
it is the company s practice to provide a valuation allowance for inventories to account for actual market pricing deflation and inventory shrinkage 
management actively reviews this inventory to determine that all materials are for products still in production to determine any potential obsolescence issues 
while historical write downs have not been material  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
acquisition accounting we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting 
this requires that we make various assumptions and estimates regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition 
these assumptions can have a material impact on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future 
goodwill  acquired intangibles  and long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets are reviewed annually  if at any time the facts or circumstances at any of our individual subsidiaries indicate impairment of long lived asset values  as a result of a continual decline in performance  or as a result of fundamental changes in a subsidiary market conditions  a determination is made as to whether the carrying value of the property long lived assets exceeds estimated realizable value 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the company performed the qualitative assessment using a more likely than not concept for fiscal year the determination of the value of such intangible assets required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
management determined that there is less than chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  thus no goodwill impairment was recorded in continuing operations
