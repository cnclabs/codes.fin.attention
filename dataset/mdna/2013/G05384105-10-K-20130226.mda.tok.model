the principal representative is also responsible for notifying the bma where the principal representative believes there is a likelihood of the insurer becoming insolvent or that a reportable event under the insurance act has  to the principal representative s knowledge  occurred or believed to have occurred 
the insurance act imposes solvency  capital adequacy and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements 
it also grants the bma powers to supervise  investigate  require information and the production of documents  and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
significant requirements include the appointment of an independent auditor  the appointment of a loss reserve specialist and the filing of the required annual returns with the bma 
supervision  investigation and intervention

if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of aspen bermuda becoming insolvent  or being in breach of the insurance act  or any conditions imposed upon its registration under the insurance act  the bma may  among other things  direct aspen bermuda i not to take on any new insurance business  ii not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase its liabilities  iii not to make certain investments  iv to realize certain investments  v to maintain in or transfer to the custody of a specified bank certain assets  vi not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions  or to restrict the making of such payments  vii to limit its premium income  viii to remove a controller or officer  and or ix to file a petition for the winding up of the insurer 
restrictions on dividends and distributions 
aspen bermuda and aspen holdings must comply with the provisions of the bermuda companies act  as amended  the companies act 
table of contents regulating the payment of dividends and distributions 
a bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a the company is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or b the realizable value of the company s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities 
further  an insurer may not declare or pay any dividends during any financial year if it would cause the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins  and an insurer which fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year may not  without the approval of the bma  declare or pay any dividends during the next financial year

further  aspen bermuda must obtain the prior approval of the bma before reducing by or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year s financial statements 
enhanced capital requirements and minimum solvency 
the bma has introduced a risk based capital adequacy model called the bermuda solvency capital requirement bscr for class insurers like aspen bermuda to assist the bma both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization 
the bscr employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business 
the bscr applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer s assets  liabilities and premiums  including a formula to take account of the catastrophe risk exposure 
aspen bermuda must maintain available capital and surplus in an amount equal to or exceeding its enhanced capital requirements ecr calculated using the bscr model 
in order to minimize the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation  the bma expects that insurers operate at or above a threshold captive level termed the target capital level tcl  which exceeds an insurer s ecr 
the tcl for a class insurer is set at of ecr 
aspen bermuda holds capital in excess of its tcl 
as a class insurer  aspen bermuda is also required to meet a minimum margin of solvency being equal to the greater of a  b of net premiums written being gross premiums written less any premiums ceded by the insurer  but the insurer may not deduct more than of gross premiums when computing net premiums written in its current financial year  or c of net losses and loss expense reserves 
the bma has also introduced a three tiered capital system for class insurers designed to assess the quality of capital resources that an insurer has available to meet its capital requirements 
the tiered capital system classifies all capital instruments into one of three tiers based on their loss absorbency characteristics with the highest quality capital classified as tier capital and lesser quality capital classified as either tier capital or tier capital 
only tier and tier capital may be used to support an insurer s minimum solvency margin 
only certain percentages of tier  and capital may be used to satisfy an insurer s ecr 
any combination of tier  or capital may be used to meet the tcl 
class insurers are also required to perform an assessment of their own risk and solvency requirements  referred to as a commercial insurer s solvency self assessment cissa 
the cissa 
table of contents allows the bma to obtain an insurer s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess the company s governance  risk management and controls surrounding this process 
class insurers must also file with the bma a catastrophe risk return which assesses an insurer s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure 
minimum liquidity ratio 
the insurance act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers  like aspen bermuda 
an insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than of the amount of its relevant liabilities 
relevant assets include  but are not limited to  cash and time deposits  quoted investments  unquoted bonds and debentures  first liens on real estate  investment income due and accrued  accounts and premiums receivable  reinsurance balances receivable and funds held by ceding reinsurers 
there are certain categories of assets which  unless specifically permitted by the bma  do not automatically qualify as relevant assets  such as unquoted equity securities  investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans

the bermuda insurance code of conduct 
the bma has implemented an insurance code  the insurance code of conduct the bermuda insurance code  which came into effect on july  the code is divided into six categories  including proportionality principle  corporate governance  risk management  governance mechanism  outsourcing  and market discipline and disclosure

group supervision 
the bma has implemented a framework for group supervision

key elements of the framework for group supervision are the insurance group supervision rules  as amended group supervision rules  sets out the rules in respect of the assessment of the financial situation and solvency of an insurance group  the system of governance and risk management of the insurance group  and supervisory reporting and disclosures of the insurance group 
the majority of the group supervision rules came into operation on january  however  certain sections came into operation on january  which include that every insurance group must prepare a consolidated financial statements of the parent company of the group  b financial statements of the parent company of the group  and c annual statutory financial return  each of which is to be prepared in accordance with the group supervision rules 
the transition period for insurers to bring their capital instruments in compliance with the bma s eligible capital standards is ten years  ie  to january   and the insurance prudential standards insurance group solvency requirement rules  as amended group solvency rules  which came into operation on january  the group solvency rules set out the rules in respect of the capital and solvency return and ecr for an insurance group

the financial services authority the fsa is the single statutory regulator responsible for regulating the financial services industry in respect of the carrying on of regulated activities including insurance  investment management  deposit taking and most other financial services carried on by way of business in the uk aspen uk has received authorization from the fsa to effect and carry out contracts of insurance which includes reinsurance in the uk in all classes of general non life business 
an insurance company with fsa authorization to write insurance business in the uk may provide cross border services in other member states of the european economic area eea subject to notifying the fsa prior to commencement of the provision of services and the fsa not having good reason to refuse consent 
as an alternative  such an insurance company may establish a branch office within another member state 
aspen uk has notified the fsa of its intention to write insurance and reinsurance business in other eea member states 
as a result  aspen uk is licensed to write insurance business under the freedom of services and under the freedom of establishment rights contained in the european council s insurance directives within the eea members states and as a general insurer is also able to carry out reinsurance business on a cross border services basis across the eea 
the fsa remains responsible for the supervision of aspen uk s european branches 
the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an authorized person  culminating in the ultimate sanction of the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity 
the fsa has power  among other things  to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of its rules by authorized firms and approved persons 

table of contents supervision 
the fsa visited aspen uk in october and carried out a risk assessment and high level review of our individual capital assessment ica 
the fsa highlighted in its report a small number of areas where it intended to perform additional work  none of which are deemed to be material 
restrictions on dividend payments 
the company law of england and wales prohibits aspen uk from declaring a dividend to its shareholders unless it has profits available for distribution 
the determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses 
while the uk insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer s ability to declare a dividend  the fsa s rules require each insurance company within its jurisdiction to maintain its solvency margin at all times 
solvency requirements 
aspen uk is required to maintain a margin of solvency at all times  the calculation of which depends on the type and amount of insurance business written 
the method of calculation of the solvency margin or capital resources requirement is set out in the fsa s prudential sourcebook for insurers  and for these purposes  all assets and liabilities are subject to specific valuation rules 
in addition to its required minimum solvency margin  each insurance company is required to calculate an ecr  which is a measure of the capital resources a firm may need to hold  based on risk sensitive calculations applied to a company s business profile which includes capital charges based on assets  claims and premiums 
an insurer is also required to maintain financial resources which are adequate  both as to amount and quality  to ensure that there is no significant risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they fall due 
this process is called the ica 
as part of the ica  the insurer is required to take comprehensive risk factors into account  including market  credit  operational  liquidity and group risks  and to carry out stress and scenario tests to identify an appropriate range of realistic adverse scenarios in which the risk crystallizes and to estimate the financial resources needed in each of the circumstances and events identified 
the fsa may give individual capital guidance to insurers and reinsurers following receipt of icas 
if the fsa considers that there are insufficient capital resources it can give guidance advising the insurer of the amount and quality of capital resources it considers necessary for that insurer 
additionally  aspen uk is required to meet local capital requirements for its branches in canada  singapore  australia and its insurance branch in switzerland 
aspen uk holds capital in excess of all of its regulatory capital requirements 
an insurer that is part of a group is also required to perform and submit to the fsa a solvency margin calculation return in respect of its ultimate parent undertaking  in accordance with the fsa s rules 
this return is not part of an insurer s own solvency return and is not publicly available 
although there is no requirement for the parent undertaking solvency calculation to show a positive result where the ultimate parent undertaking is outside the eea  the fsa may take action where it considers that the solvency of the uk insurance company is or may be jeopardized due to the group solvency position 
further  an insurer is required to report in its annual returns to the fsa all material related party transactions eg  intra group reinsurance  whose value is more than of the insurer s general insurance business amount 
an eu directive covering the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers  known as solvency ii  was adopted by the european parliament in april until recently the anticipated implementation date of this legislation was january   however  in the light of delays in the parliamentary process within europe  the fsa has confirmed that the official solvency ii implementation date of january  is no longer tenable 
for more information regarding the risks associated with solvency ii  please refer to item a  risk factors 

table of contents change of control 
the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company and lloyd s managing agent which are authorized under financial services and markets act fsma 
any company or individual that together with any person with whom it or he is acting in concert directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a uk authorized insurance company or lloyd s managing agent  or their parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or lloyd s managing agent or their parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or their parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of the ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of aspen uk or amal 
under fsma  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must give prior notification to the fsa of his intention to do so 
the fsa would then have sixty working days to consider that person s application to acquire control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against aspen uk or amal as relevant by the fsa 
failure to make the relevant prior application would constitute criminal offence 
a person who is already deemed to have control will require prior approval of the fsa if such person increases their level of control beyond certain percentages 
these percentages are  and 
changes to uk regulation 
in june  the uk chancellor announced changes to the way in which financial services firms will be regulated 
these changes include separating the regulation of prudential and conduct operations both currently regulated by the fsa into two new operations the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca 
this is also known as the twin peaks operating model 
the pra and fca are expected to officially come into existence on april  known as legal cutover  subject to the financial services bill being approved by parliament 
once implemented  regulated firms  such as aspen uk  will be supervised separately by the pra and fca  with the two organizations working to different objectives as follows prudential supervision under the pra will continue to have dedicated resources supervising firms  and conduct supervision under the fca will focus more on thematic work  and less on firm specific work 
the pra and fca are expected to coordinate closely and share information and data on regulated firms

generally  state insurance statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring or more of aspen holdings ordinary shares would indirectly acquire the same percentage of common stock of aspen holdings us operating subsidiaries  the us insurance change of control laws will likely apply to such a transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of aspen holdings  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of the shareholders of aspen holdings might consider to be desirable 
state insurance regulation 
state insurance authorities have broad authority to regulate admitted insurance business  including licensing  admitted assets  capital and surplus  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  establishing reserve requirements or solvency standards  filing of rates and forms and regulating investments and dividends 
aaic and aspen specialty prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles sap and procedures prescribed or permitted by applicable domiciliary states 
state insurance laws and regulations require aspen specialty and aaic to file statutory financial statements with insurance departments in every state where they are licensed 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the books and records  financial reporting  policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies licensed in their states  generally once every three to five years 
examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
state dividend limitations 
under north dakota law  aspen specialty may only pay dividends out of earned surplus as distinguished from contributed surplus 
under texas law  aaic s policyholder surplus after payment of a dividend shall be an amount reasonable in relation to aaic s outstanding liabilities and adequate to aaic s financial needs 

table of contents in addition  the ability of aspen specialty or aaic to declare extraordinary dividends is subject to prior approval of the applicable state insurance regulator 
north dakota and texas define an extraordinary dividend as a dividend that exceeds  together with all dividends declared or distributed by the insurer within the preceding twelve months  the greater of of its policyholders surplus as of the st day of december of the preceding year  or the statutory net income  not including realized capital gains for the month period ending  for the preceding calendar year the st day of december next preceding 
any dividend paid by aspen specialty and aaic is paid to aspen us holdings 
aspen us holdings and any other aspen holding company entities must also meet their own dividend eligibility requirements in order to pass along any dividends received from subsidiary insurance companies such as aspen specialty and aaic 
the dividend limitations imposed by north dakota and texas insurance laws are based on the financial results of the company s us operating subsidiaries determined by using sap accounting practices  which differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the significant differences relate to deferred acquisition expenses  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes 
at december   aspen specialty and aaic did not have earned surplus and therefore could not declare or distribute dividends in state risk based capital regulations 
most states require their domestic insurers to annually report their risk based capital based on a formula that takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the states use the formula as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers for the purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
most states insurance law imposes broad confidentiality requirements on those engaged in any manner in the insurance business and on the regulator as to the use and publication of risk based capital data 
the regulator typically has explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by  or to take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain risk based capital levels 
statutory accounting principles 
sap is a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
sap is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
us gaap is concerned with a company s solvency  but it is also concerned with other financial measurements  such as income and cash flows 
accordingly  us gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap as opposed to sap 
sap  which is established by the naic and adopted by the departments of insurance of most states  determines  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of our us operating subsidiaries and thus determines  in part  the amount of funds they have available to pay as dividends to parent company entities 

table of contents guaranty funds and residual market mechanisms 
licensed and admitted us insurers such as aaic are required to participate in various state residual market mechanisms whose goal is to provide affordability and availability of insurance to those consumers who may not otherwise be able to obtain insurance  including  for example catastrophe insurance in high risk areas 
the mechanics of how each state s residual markets operate may differ  but generally  risks are either assigned to various private carriers or the state manages the risk through a pooling arrangement 
if losses exceed the funds the pool has available to pay those losses  the pools have the ability to assess insurers to provide additional funds to the pool 
the amounts of the assessment for each company are normally based upon the proportion of each insurer s and in some cases the insurer s and its affiliates written premium for coverages similar to those provided by the pool  and are frequently uncapped 
state guaranty associations also have the ability to assess licensed us insurers in order to provide funds for payment of losses for insurers which have become insolvent 
in many cases  but not all  assessed insurers may recoup the amount of these guaranty fund and state pool assessments through premium rates  premium tax credits or policy surcharges 
operations of aspen uk and aspen bermuda 
aspen uk and aspen bermuda are not admitted to engage in the business of insurance in the us  although aspen us is eligible to write surplus lines business in us jurisdictions as an alien  non admitted insurer 
the laws of most states regulate or prohibit the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by non admitted insurers and reinsurers 
we do not intend that aspen bermuda maintain an office or solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction other than bermuda where the conduct of such activities would require aspen bermuda to be so admitted 
however  aspen bermuda is authorized by the bma to write excess casualty insurance business for us insureds 
this effectively means that us insureds are able to go out of state directly to aspen bermuda to insure their risks without the involvement of a local surplus line broker 
aspen uk does not maintain an office in the us but it reinsures us primary risk and writes excess and surplus lines business as an eligible  but non admitted  alien surplus lines insurer 
it accepts business only through us licensed surplus lines brokers and does not market directly to the public 
although it does not underwrite or handle claims directly in the us  aspen us may grant limited underwriting authorities and retain third party administrators  duly licensed  for the purpose of facilitating u 
s business 
aspen uk has also issued limited underwriting authorities to various affiliated us entities described above 
in addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed  reinsurers business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various us states governing credit for reinsurance laws imposed on ceding companies 
in general  a ceding company which obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the reinsurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums which are that portion of premiums written which applies to the unexpired portion of the policy period and loss reserves and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
aspen bermuda is not licensed  accredited or approved in any state in the united states 
the great majority of states  however  permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non licensed or non accredited reinsurer to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement 
a few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non licensed reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited 
for its us reinsurance activities  aspen us has established and must retain a multi beneficiary us trust fund for the benefit of its us cedants so that they are able to take financial statement credit 
table of contents for reinsurance without the need for aspen uk to post contract specific security 
the minimum trust fund amount is million plus an amount equal to of aspen uk s us reinsurance liabilities  which were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
in the past  aspen uk has applied for trusteed reinsurer approvals in states where us cedants are domiciled and is currently an approved trusteed reinsurer in us jurisdictions 
as a result of the dodd frank act  only a ceding insurer s state of domicile can dictate the credit for reinsurance requirements 
other states in which a ceding insurer is licensed will no longer be able to require additional collateral from non admitted reinsurers or otherwise impose their own credit for reinsurance laws on ceding insurers domiciled in other states 
in addition  several states have begun efforts to change their credit for reinsurance laws and regulations as florida and new york already have  so that qualifying non admitted reinsurers meeting certain minimum rating and capital requirements would  upon application to the state insurance departments  be permitted to post less than the collateral currently required in most us states 
as collateral reduction efforts continue  we will continue to monitor developments 
aspen uk and aspen bermuda intend to seek approval to post reduced collateral in relevant states 
lloyd s is licensed as a market in illinois  kentucky and the u 
s virgin islands to write insurance business 
it is also eligible to write surplus lines and reinsurance business in all other us states and territories 
lloyd s as a whole makes certain returns to us regulators and each syndicate makes returns to the new york insurance department with respect to its surplus lines and reinsurance business 
separate trust funds are in place to support this business 

table of contents item a 
risk factors we outline below factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking and other statements contained in this report and other documents that we file with the united states securities and exchange commission the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
however  these are the risks we believe to be material as of the date of this report 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our future business or operating results 
any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
introduction as with any publicly traded company  investing in our equity and debt securities carries risks 
our risk management strategy is designed to identify  measure  monitor and manage material risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and we have invested significant resources to develop the appropriate risk management policies and procedures to implement this strategy 
nonetheless  the future business environment is intrinsically uncertain and difficult to forecast and our risk management methods may not be successful for this reason or because of other unintended weaknesses in our approach 
we set out below the risks that we have identified using the classification system that we use in our risk management process 
for this purpose  we divide risks into core and non core risks 
core risks comprise those risks which are inherent in the operation of our business including insurance risks in respect of our underwriting operations and market and liquidity risks in respect of our investment activity 
we intentionally expose the company to core risks with a view to generating shareholder value  but seek to manage the resulting volatility in our earnings and financial condition to within the limits defined by our risk appetite 
however  these core risks are intrinsically difficult to measure and manage and we may not therefore be successful in this respect 
all other risks  including regulatory and operational risks  are classified as non core 
we seek as far as is practicable and economic to avoid or minimize our exposure to non core risks that we identify as potentially material 
insurance risks our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural catastrophic events 
as part of our insurance and reinsurance operations  we assume substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural catastrophic events including  but not limited to  severe weather  floods  wildfires  volcanic eruptions  earthquakes and tsunamis 
the severe weather events to which we are exposed include tropical storms  cyclones  hurricanes  winter storms  tornadoes  hailstorms and severe rainfall causing flash floods 
the incidence  severity and magnitude of such catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes have been and can be substantial 
the occurrence of large claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in  and materially affect  our financial condition  operating results for any fiscal quarter or year and our ability to write new business 

table of contents we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future and that climate change may increase the frequency and severity of severe weather events and flooding 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to these events through a multitude of approaches including geographic diversification  geographical limits  individual policy limits  exclusions or limitations from coverage and purchase of reinsurance  these management tools may not react in the way that we expect 
in addition  a single catastrophic event could affect multiple geographic zones or the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
the models we use to assess our exposure to losses from future natural catastrophes contain inherent uncertainties and our actual losses may therefore differ significantly from expectations 
to help assess our exposure to losses from natural catastrophes we use computer based models  which simulate multiple scenarios using a variety of assumptions 
these models are developed in part by third party vendors and their effectiveness relies on many inputs and assumptions including  but not limited to  scientific research  historical data  exposure data provided by insureds and reinsureds  data on the terms and conditions of insurance policies  and the professional judgment of our employees and other industry specialists 
while the models have evolved considerably over time they do not necessarily accurately measure the statistical distribution of future losses due to the inherent limitations of the inputs and assumptions on which they rely 
these limitations are evidenced by significant variation in the results obtained from different models  material changes in model results over time due to refinement of the underlying data elements and assumptions and the uncertain predictive capability and performance of industry models over longer time intervals 
the effect of these limitations is that future losses from catastrophic events may be larger and more frequent than expected and larger or more frequent than those reported in the company s financial statements to date 
the frequency and severity of weather related catastrophes may increase due to cyclical variations in climate and global climate change 
weather patterns  including the frequency and severity of severe weather events  are believed to be influenced by cyclical phenomena operating over periods of months or years 
for example  many observers believe that the atlantic basin is in the active phase of a multi decadal cycle in which conditions in the ocean and atmosphere  including warmer than average sea surface temperatures and low wind shear  enhance hurricane activity 
this increase in the number and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes can span multiple decades approximately to years 
there have been larger than long term average numbers of atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes in recent years although the impact on insurance losses is determined not by the number of storms that form  but by the number making landfall in populated areas with high insured values 
there is widespread consensus in the scientific community that there is a long term upward trend in global air and sea temperatures and that this is likely to increase the frequency and severity of severe weather events over the coming decades 
in addition  rising sea levels are expected to add to the risks associated with coastal flooding in many areas 

table of contents given the scientific uncertainty of predicting the effect of climate cycles and climate change on the frequency and severity of catastrophes and the lack of adequate predictive tools  we may not be able to adequately model the associated exposures and potential losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
our operating results may be adversely affected by one or more large losses from events other than natural catastrophes 
large losses from single events can occur if we are exposed to such events through more than one insurance or reinsurance contract 
such losses are referred to as clash losses 
our results can be adversely affected if there is an unexpectedly large number of clash losses in a period or if there is one or more such loss of unexpectedly large value 
we seek to manage our exposure to large losses from events other than natural catastrophes by identifying possible scenarios under which we could be exposed and limiting our exposure to these potential scenarios 
some of the more significant scenarios which we have identified in this respect are terrorist attacks  fire  explosion or spill at a refinery or offshore oil and gas installation  a poison gas cloud  the collapse of a major office building  accidents at nuclear power stations  the collision of two ships and the loss of a passenger airplane 
these risks are inherently unpredictable 
it is difficult to predict the frequency of events of this nature and to estimate the amount of loss that any given occurrence will generate 
to the extent that losses from these risks occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results may be adversely affected by an unexpected accumulation of attritional losses 
in addition to our exposures to natural catastrophe and other large losses as discussed above  our operating results may also be adversely affected by unexpectedly large accumulations of smaller losses 
we seek to manage this risk by using appropriate underwriting processes to guide the pricing and acceptance of risks 
these processes  which include pricing models where appropriate  are intended to ensure that premiums received are sufficient to cover the expected levels of attritional loss as well as a contribution to the cost of natural catastrophes and large losses where necessary 
however  it is possible that our underwriting approaches or our pricing models may not work as intended in this respect and that actual losses from a class of risks may be greater than expected thus causing adverse variation in our financial condition and or operating results 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
claim and coverage issues can arise when the application of insurance or reinsurance policy language to potentially covered claims is unclear or disputed by the parties 
when new such issues emerge they may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under insurance or reinsurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued 
emerging claim and coverage issues could therefore have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents in particular  our exposure to casualty reinsurance and insurance lines increases our potential exposure to this risk due to the uncertainties of expanded theories of liability and the long tail nature of these lines of business 
we may face increased exposure as a result of litigation related to the crisis in financial markets and subsequent recessions  volatility in capital and credit markets  distressed financial institutions and sovereign debt crises 
these economic and market conditions may increase allegations of misconduct  fraud and negligence  which may result in increased levels of insured claims arising in lines of business such as financial institutions  management liability and professional liability and in reinsurance of these lines 
the full extent of our liability and exposure to claims of this sort may not be known for many years 
this could adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
the monetary impact of certain claims may be hard to predict or ascertain upon inception and potential losses from such claims can be significant 
for example  the full extent of our liability and exposure from claims of bad faith is not ascertainable until the claim has been presented and investigated 
as such  a significant claim in monetary terms on the basis of bad faith could adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates and policy terms and conditions 
historically the insurance and reinsurance industry has been cyclical 
it is characterized by periods of intense competition on price and policy terms due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permit favorable premium levels 
in addition  any prolonged economic downturn could result in reduced demand for insurance and reinsurance products which could adversely impact the pricing of our products 
the supply of insurance and reinsurance may increase  either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing or new insurers or reinsurers  which may cause prices to decrease 
any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly  and we expect to experience the effects of such cyclicality 
to the extent these trends emerge  our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
a material proportion of our business relies on the assessment and pricing of individual risks by third parties  including insurance companies which we reinsure and agents to whom we delegate underwriting authority for certain insurance products 
from time to time  we authorize managing general agents  general agents and other producers to write business on our behalf within underwriting authorities prescribed by us 
we rely on the underwriting controls of these agents to write business within the underwriting authorities provided by us 
although we monitor our underwriting on an ongoing basis  our monitoring efforts may not be adequate and our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us 
if our agents exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us  our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
this reliance on third party assessment and pricing of individual risk extends to our reinsurance treaty business 
in common with other reinsurers  we do not separately evaluate each of the individual 
table of contents risks assumed under most reinsurance treaties 
therefore  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded to us may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume and the losses we may incur 
the failure of any risk management and loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we seek to mitigate our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  such that we only pay losses that exceed a specified retention 
we also seek to limit certain risks  such as natural catastrophe and political risks by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of zone boundaries and the allocation of policy limits to zones 
in the case of proportional property reinsurance treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event  though we may not be able to obtain such limits in certain markets 
various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage and choice of forum  intended to limit our risks may not be enforceable 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective or that disputes relating to coverage will be resolved in our favor 
as a result of the risks that we insure and reinsure  unforeseen events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
reinsurance purchase is another loss limitation method we employ which may not always act in the way intended due to disputes relating to coverage or exclusions 
the reinsurance that we purchase may not always be available on favorable terms or we may choose to retain a higher proportion of particular risks than in previous years 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amount of reinsurance or retrocession protection on terms that are acceptable to us from entities with a satisfactory credit rating 
we also may choose to retain a higher proportion of particular risks than in previous years due to pricing  terms and conditions or strategic emphasis 
we may seek alternative means to transfer risk  such as catastrophe bonds  contingent capital arrangements and other capital market solutions 
these solutions may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional retrocession 
our inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or other protection for our own account could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if actual claims exceed our loss reserves 
our operating results and financial condition depend upon our ability to accurately assess the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
to the extent actual claims exceed our expectations  we will be required immediately to recognize the less favorable experience 
this could cause a 
table of contents material increase in our provisions for liabilities and a reduction in our profitability  including operating losses and reduction of capital 
if natural catastrophic events or other large losses occur  we may fail to adequately estimate our reserve requirements and our actual losses and loss expenses may deviate  perhaps substantially  from our reserve estimates 
only reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be set aside in our financial statements  with no allowance for future losses 
see item above  business reserves and part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further description of our reserving process and methodology 
there are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them 
in property reinsurance  there is still the potential for adverse development from litigation associated with hurricane katrina and losses related to superstorm sandy and the catastrophe events  in particular the thai floods 
in casualty reinsurance  there are additional uncertainties associated with claims emanating from the global financial crisis and the potential for new types of claim top arise given the long tail nature of many of the reinsurance risks 
in the insurance segment  we wrote a book of financial institutions risks which have a number of notifications relating to the financial crisis in and and there is also a specific area of uncertainty relating to a book of new york contractor business 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses also includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatment and litigation costs 
we write casualty business in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and certain other territories  where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
see also part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
market and liquidity risks our financial condition and financial results may be adversely affected by reductions in the value of our aggregate investment portfolio 
our funds are invested by several professional investment management firms in accordance with detailed investment guidelines set by us 
see business investments under item  above 
our investment policies stress diversification of risks  conservation of principal and liquidity through conservative investment guidelines 
however  our investments are subject to a variety of financial and capital market risks  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  market volatility and risks inherent to particular securities 
prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including  among other things  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies  defaults  and significant ratings downgrades  may cause significant losses in our investment portfolio 
market volatility can make it difficult to value certain securities if their trading becomes infrequent 
depending on market conditions  we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized investment losses in future periods 
separately  the occurrence of large claims may force us to liquidate securities at an inopportune time  which may cause us to realize capital losses 
large investment losses could decrease our asset base  thereby affecting our ability to underwrite new business 
additionally  such losses could have a material adverse impact on our shareholders equity  
table of contents business and financial strength and debt ratings 
for the twelve months ended december   million of our income before tax was derived from our net invested assets 
the aggregate performance of our investment portfolio depends to a significant extent on the ability of our investment managers to select and manage appropriate investments 
as a result  we are also exposed to operational risks which may include  but are not limited to  a failure to follow our investment guidelines  technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans 
the failure of these investment managers to perform their services in a manner consistent with our expectations and investment objectives could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
unexpected volatility or illiquidity associated with some of our investments could significantly and negatively affect our financial results and ability to conduct business 
we hold  or may in the future purchase  certain investments such as high yield bonds  bank loans  non agency residential mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities which may have less liquidity than other fixed income securities 
during the height of the financial crisis some high quality assets were more illiquid than expected 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
if we were forced to sell our assets in unfavorable market conditions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
as a result  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
our financial results may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our operations are the us dollar  the british pound  the euro  the swiss franc  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the singaporean dollar 
during the course of  the us dollar british pound exchange rate  our most significant exchange rate exposure  fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
for the twelve months ended december   and   and  respectively  of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
a portion of our loss reserves and investments are also in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us non british currencies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we use forward exchange contracts to manage some of our foreign currency exposure 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully structure those contracts so as to effectively manage these risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the continuation of heightened systemic financial risks  including excess sovereign debt  risks to the banking system and the eurozone debt crisis  could have a material adverse effect on global and regional economies and capital markets which could adversely affect our business prospects  financial condition  financial results and liquidity 
in recent years  global financial markets have been characterized by volatility and uncertainty 
unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs  limit our access to the capital markets or make credit harder to obtain 
developments in the financial markets may also affect our 
table of contents counterparties which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in the event of further deterioration or volatility in financial markets or general economic conditions  it could result in a prolonged economic downturn or recession and our operating results  financial position and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  global markets and economic conditions continue to be negatively impacted by the ability of certain eurozone member states to service their sovereign debt obligations 
if the fiscal obligations of these eurozone member states continue to exceed their fiscal revenue  taking into account the reactions of the credit and swap markets  the ability of such member states to service their debt in a cost efficient manner will be impaired 
the continued uncertainty over the outcome of various eurozone and international financial support programs and the possibility that other eurozone member states may experience similar financial pressures could further disrupt global markets 
in particular  this crisis has disrupted and could further disrupt equity and fixed income markets and could result in volatile and unserviceable bond yields on the sovereign debt of some eurozone members 
the issues arising out of the current eurozone debt crisis may cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of european financial institutions and the stability of eurozone member economies  and likewise affect uk and uk based financial institutions  the stability of the global financial markets and any economic recovery 
if a eurozone member state were to default on its obligations or seek to leave the eurozone  the impact on the financial and currency markets would be significant and could materially impact all financial institutions  including our business  financial condition  operating results and liquidity 
credit risks our operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of policyholders  brokers or other intermediaries to honor their payment obligations to us 
in accordance with industry practice  we generally pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case  in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  in a significant majority of business that we write  it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations 
likewise  when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and  in most cases  the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses related to such credit risks 
in addition  bankruptcy  liquidity problems  distressed financial condition or the general effects of economic recession may increase the risk that policyholders may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us  despite an obligation to do so 
the terms of our contracts may not permit us to cancel our insurance even though we have not received payment 
if non payment becomes widespread  whether as a result of bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure or otherwise  it could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

table of contents our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of one or more reinsurers to meet their payment obligation to us 
we purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of certain large and multiple losses upon our financial condition 
our reinsurers are dependent on their ratings in order to continue to write business  and some have suffered downgrades in ratings as a result of their exposures in the past 
our reinsurers may also be affected by recent adverse developments in the financial markets  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
a reinsurer s insolvency  its inability to continue to write business or its reluctance to make timely payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on us because we may remain liable to our insureds or cedants in respect of the reinsured risks 
the impairment of financial institutions increases our counterparty risk 
we have exposure to many different counterparties  and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks and other institutions 
we also hold as investments various fixed income securities issued by financial institutions  which may be unsecured 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  with respect to secured transactions  our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it 
any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
strategic risks we operate in a highly competitive environment  and substantial new capital inflows into the insurance and reinsurance industry may increase competition 
insurance and reinsurance markets remain highly competitive 
we continue to compete with existing international and regional insurers and reinsurers some of which have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
we also compete with new market entrants and with alternative capital markets  funds and other providers of insurance products such as insurance linked securities  catastrophe bonds and derivatives 
see business competition under item  above for a list of our competitors 
recently  insureds have retained a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously  and industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies  and other mechanisms for funding their risks  rather than risk transferring insurance 
increased competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates  less favorable policy terms and conditions and greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability 
we have recently experienced increased competition in some lines of business which has caused a decline in rate increases or a reduction in rates 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents recent events may result in political  regulatory and industry initiatives which could adversely affect our business 
governments and regulatory bodies may take unpredictable action to ensure continued supply of insurance  particularly where a given event leads to withdrawal of capacity from the market 
for example  as a result of the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  a number of government initiatives have been launched recently that are designed to stabilize market conditions 
the us federal government  federal reserve  us treasury and government and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other extraordinary actions to address the global financial crisis 
there can be no assurance as to the effect that any such governmental actions will have on the financial markets generally or on our competitive position  business and financial condition in particular  although we continue to monitor these and similar proposals 
see regulatory risks below 
our operating subsidiaries are rated  and our lloyd s business benefits from a rating by one or more of am best  s p and moody s  and a decline in any of these ratings could adversely affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
the ratings of our operating subsidiaries are subject to periodic review by  and may be placed on credit watch  revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of  am best  s p or moody s 
if our or lloyd s ratings are reduced from their current levels by any of am best  moody s or s p  our competitive position in the insurance industry might suffer and it might be more difficult for us to market our products  expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements 
a downgrade also may require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients  and could trigger provisions allowing some clients to terminate their insurance and reinsurance contracts with us 
some contracts also provide for the return of premium to the ceding client in the event of a downgrade 
it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain such terms 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings and therefore may materially and adversely impact our business  operating results  liquidity and financial flexibility 
in addition  a downgrade of the financial strength rating of aspen uk  aspen bermuda or aspen specialty by uk best below b would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility with barclays bank plc and other lenders 
similarly  a downgrade of aspen uk and aspen bermuda by uk best below b would constitute an event of default under our letter of credit facility with barclays bank plc 
a lower rating may lead to higher borrowing costs  thereby adversely impacting our liquidity and financial flexibility 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our long term strategy  we may pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in businesses or new underwriting or marketing platforms 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business  new personnel  new underwriting or marketing platforms could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from 
table of contents unanticipated litigation  higher levels of claims than is reflected in reserves and an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
any future acquisitions or strategic investments may expose us to operational risks including integrating financial and operational reporting systems  establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls  funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses  the value of assets acquired may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates and liabilities assumed may be greater than expected  and financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification  reinsurance and other obligations to us 
we have limited experience in identifying quality merger candidates  as well as successfully acquiring and integrating their operations 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions  strategic investments or new platforms will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our insurance and reinsurance revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
see item above  business business distribution for our principal brokers by segment 
several of these brokers also have  or may in the future acquire  ownership interests in insurance and reinsurance companies that compete with us  and these brokers may favor their own insurers or reinsurers over other companies 
in addition  as brokers merge with  or acquire  each other  there could be further strain on our ability to access business due to a reduction in distribution channels 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully  to deploy capital into more profitable business lines  to identify acquisition opportunities  to manage investments and preserve capital in volatile markets  and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we monitor our capital adequacy on an ongoing basis 
to the extent that our funds are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and or cover claims losses  we may need to raise additional funds through corporate finance transactions or curtail our growth and reduce our liabilities 
our additional needs for capital will depend on our actual claims experience  especially for catastrophic events 
any equity  hybrid or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents our debt  credit and international swap dealers association isda agreements may limit our financial and operational flexibility  which may affect our ability to conduct our business 
we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
additionally  we have entered into credit facilities with various institutions 
under these credit facilities  the institutions provide revolving lines of credit to us and our major operating subsidiaries and issue letters of credit to our clients in the ordinary course of business 
we have also entered into isda agreements relating to derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps 
the agreements relating to our debt  credit facilities and our isda agreements contain covenants that may limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
some of these agreements also require us to maintain specified ratings and financial ratios  including a minimum net worth covenant 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet required financial ratios  the lenders or counterparties under these agreements could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them 
if we are in default under the terms of these agreements  then we may also be restricted in our ability to declare or pay any dividends  redeem  purchase or acquire any shares or make a liquidation payment and are at risk of cross default on other arrangements 
the development of our us based insurance operations is subject to execution risks and increased risk from changing market conditions 
excess and surplus lines insurance forms a substantial portion of the business written by our us based insurance operations 
excess and surplus lines insurance covers risks that are typically more complex and unusual than standard risks and require a high degree of specialized underwriting 
as a result  excess and surplus lines risks do not often fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance carriers 
our excess and surplus lines insurance business fills the insurance needs of businesses with unique characteristics and is generally considered higher risk than those in the standard market 
if our underwriting staff inadequately judges and prices the risks associated with the business underwritten in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
further  the excess and surplus lines market is significantly affected by the conditions of the property and casualty insurance market in general 
this cyclicality can be more pronounced in the excess and surplus market than in the standard insurance market 
during times of hard market conditions when market conditions are more favorable to insurers  as rates increase and coverage terms become more restrictive  business tends to move from the admitted market to the excess and surplus lines market and growth in the excess and surplus market tends to accelerate faster than growth in the standard insurance market 
when soft market conditions are prevalent when market conditions are less favorable to insurers  standard insurance carriers tend to reduce underwriting standards and expand market share by moving into business lines traditionally characterized as excess and surplus lines  exacerbating the effect of rate decreases 
if we fail to manage the cyclical nature and volatility of the revenues and profit we generate in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 

table of contents regulatory risks the regulatory systems under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operating subsidiaries may not be able to maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations in territories where we currently engage in business or obtain them in new territories  or may be able to do so only at significant cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or to engage in certain activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations to which our operating subsidiaries are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see business regulatory matters in item  above 
material changes in voting rights and connected party transactions may require regulatory approval or oversight by the fsa or other insurance regulators 
insurance regulators  such as the fsa and the bma  impose certain requirements on operating entities they regulate including notification of shareholders  whether directly or indirectly  reaching certain levels of ownership 
prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares by the regulators may be required under certain circumstances 
if any entity were to hold or more of the voting rights or or more of the issued ordinary shares of aspen holdings  transactions between aspen uk and such entity may have to be reported to the fsa if the value of those transactions exceeds certain threshold amounts that would render them material connected party transactions 
in these circumstances  we can give no assurance that these material connected party transactions will not be subject to regulatory intervention by the fsa or other insurance regulators 
any transactions between companies within the aspen group that are material connected party transactions would also have to be reported to the fsa and other insurance regulators 
we can give no assurance that the existence or effect of such connected party transactions and the fsa s or any other insurance regulator s assessment of the overall solvency of aspen holdings and its subsidiaries  even in circumstances where the operating subsidiary has on its face sufficient assets of its own to cover its required margin of solvency  would not result in regulatory intervention by the fsa or other insurance regulators with regard to such operating subsidiary 
one or more of our insurance subsidiaries may be required by its regulator to hold additional capital to meet relevant solvency requirements 
any of our operating subsidiaries may be required to hold additional capital in order to meet solvency requirements 
for example  aspen uk is required to provide the fsa with information about aspen holdings notional solvency  which involves calculating the solvency position of aspen holdings in accordance with the fsa s rules 
in this regard  if aspen bermuda  aspen specialty  aaic or syndicate were to experience financial difficulties  it could affect the solvency position of aspen holdings and in turn trigger regulatory intervention by the fsa with respect to aspen uk the fsa requires insurers and reinsurers to calculate their ecr  an indicative measure of 
table of contents the capital resources a firm may need to hold  based on risk sensitive calculations applied to its business profile which includes capital charges based on assets  claims and premiums 
the fsa may give insurers individual capital guidance  which may result in guidance that a company should hold capital in excess of the ecr 
these changes may increase the required regulatory capital of aspen uk  impacting our profitability 
among other matters  bermuda statutes  regulations and policies of the bma require aspen bermuda to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital  surplus and liquidity  to meet solvency standards 
the bma has a risk based capital adequacy model called the bscr to assist the bma both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization 
in  the cissa for class insurers was introduced which requires commercial insurers to perform an assessment of their own risk and solvency requirements 
the cissa has the insurer determine the capital resources required to achieve its strategic goal  after it has assessed all reasonably foreseeable material risks arising from its operations or operational environment 
these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict aspen bermuda s ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies  to make certain investments and to distribute funds 
the eu directive on solvency ii may affect the way in which aspen uk manages its business and may lead to aspen bermuda posting collateral in respect of its eea cedants 
an eu directive covering the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers  known as solvency ii  was adopted by the european parliament in april solvency ii presents a number of risks to aspen uk and amal 
insurers are expecting to undertake a significant amount of work to ensure that they will meet the new requirements and this may divert finite resources from other business related activities 
in addition  the measures implementing solvency ii are currently subject to a consultation process and are not expected to be finalized until at the earliest  consequently  aspen s implementation plans are based on its current understanding of the solvency ii requirements  which may change 
increases in capital requirements as a result of solvency ii may be required and may impact our operating results 
further  under solvency ii  unless the european commission assesses the regulatory regime in bermuda as equivalent to solvency ii  then aspen bermuda may be required to post collateral in respect of any reinsurance of eea cedants  including aspen uk  which may have a negative impact on aspen bermuda s and aspen holdings results 
under solvency ii  if a non ec reinsurer is in a country that is deemed not equivalent  then an eea cedant may not be able to take any reinsurance into account for solvency purposes unless the non ec reinsurer is of a certain minimum credit rating or collateral has been provided 
therefore  if bermuda s solvency regime is not deemed equivalent to solvency ii  then aspen bermuda s eea cedants may require collateral from aspen bermuda in order for the cedant to take credit for such reinsurance 
as of january   the european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa has replaced the committee of european insurance and pensions supervisor 
eiopa s final advice to the european commission was that bermuda meets the criteria set out in eiopa s methodology for equivalence assessments under solvency ii for insurers of aspen bermuda s class but with certain qualifications 
the activities of any of our insurance subsidiaries may be subject to review by insurance regulators of differing jurisdiction 
review of the activities of our operating subsidiaries by regulators could exceed expectations 
for example  aspen uk is authorized to do business in the united kingdom and has permission to conduct business in canada  switzerland  australia  singapore  france  ireland  germany  all other 
table of contents eea states and certain latin american countries 
in addition  aspen uk is eligible to write surplus lines business in uk states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
we can give no assurance  however  that insurance regulators in the united states  bermuda or elsewhere will not review the activities of aspen uk and assess that aspen uk is subject to such jurisdiction s licensing or other requirements 
aspen bermuda does not maintain a principal office  and its personnel do not solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other activities that may constitute the transaction of the business of insurance or reinsurance  in any jurisdiction in which it is not licensed or otherwise not authorized to engage in such activities 
although aspen bermuda does not believe it is or will be in violation of insurance laws or regulations of any jurisdiction outside bermuda  inquiries or challenges to aspen bermuda s insurance or reinsurance activities may still be raised in the future 
the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory environment has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the united states at both federal and state levels 
compliance with any new laws  regulations or settlements impacting offshore insurers or reinsurers  such as aspen bermuda  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes to the bermuda regulatory system  including changes to its group supervisory regime  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a number of bermuda registered re insurers operates within a group structure 
this means that an insurer s financial position and risk profile  and its overall prudential position  may be impacted by being part of a group 
the bma has therefore established a group supervision framework for insurance groups to ensure solvency at group level  monitor inter group transactions and assess corporate governance  risk management and internal control processes 
the bma has notified us that it will act as the group supervisor of the aspen group of companies and has designated aspen bermuda as the designated insurer 
as group supervisor  the bma will assess the aspen group s compliance with the bma s solvency rules  perform ongoing supervisory review and assessment of the aspen group s financial position and governance systems  coordinate the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information  convene and conduct supervisory colleges with other supervisory authorities that have regulatory oversight of entities within a group and coordinate any enforcement action that may be taken against any of the members of the aspen group 
the bma has published a number of consultation and discussion papers covering the following proposed regulatory changes which may or may not become adopted in present or revised form in the future the introduction  for solvency purposes  of an economic balance sheet to ensure that all assets and liabilities are valued on a consistent economic basis  enhancements to the disclosure and transparency regime  and the imposition of a minimum  or floor  for the minimum margin of solvency msm that would be equal to of the ecr 
the msm floor would apply only at the legal entity level 
along with the implementation delays announced by the european commission  the bma has delayed  or deferred  some aspects of its regime change 
for example  the economic balance sheet 
table of contents process has been deferred to consider the direction of other international bodies such as the iasb 
in addition  some aspects of the bma s group capital requirements and the requirements for the group actuary have also been deferred 
we are unable to predict with certainty how these laws  frameworks and or regulations will be enforced or amended  the form in which any pending or future laws  frameworks and or regulations could be adopted  the effectiveness of the coordination and cooperation of information sharing among supervisory bodies and regulators  such as the fsa  with the bma as group supervisor or the effect  if any  any of these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 
the council of lloyd s and the lloyd s franchise board have wide discretionary powers to supervise members of lloyd s 
the council of lloyd s may  for instance  vary the method by which the capital requirement is determined  or the investment criteria applicable to funds at lloyd s 
variance to the capital requirement determination method might affect the maximum amount of the overall premium income that we are able to underwrite 
variation in both might affect our return on investments 
the lloyd s franchise board also has wide discretionary powers in relation to the business of lloyd s managing agents  such as amal  including the requirement for compliance with the franchise performance and underwriting guidelines 
the lloyd s franchise board imposes certain restrictions on underwriting or on reinsurance arrangements for any lloyd s syndicate and changes in these requirements imposed on us may have an adverse impact on our ability to underwrite which in turn will have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
changes in lloyd s regulation or the lloyd s market could make syndicate less attractive 
changes in lloyd s regulation or other developments in the lloyd s market could make operating syndicate less attractive 
for example  lloyd s imposes a number of charges on businesses operating in the lloyd s market  including  for example  annual subscriptions and central fund levies for members and policy signing charges 
despite the principle that each member of lloyd s is only responsible for the proportion of risk written on his or her behalf  a central fund acts as a policyholder s protection fund to make payments where other members have failed to pay valid claims 
the council of lloyd s may resolve to make payments from the central fund for the advancement and protection of members  which could lead to additional or special levies being payable by syndicate the bases and amounts of these charges may be varied by lloyd s and could adversely affect our financial and operating results 
syndicate may also be affected by a number of other changes in lloyd s regulation  such as changes to the process for the release of profits and new member compliance requirements 
the ability of lloyd s syndicates to trade in certain classes of business at current levels may be dependent on the maintenance by lloyd s of a satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency 
at present  the financial security of the lloyd s market is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies  am best  s p and fitch ratings 
see our operating subsidiaries are rated  and our lloyd s business benefits from a rating by one or more of am best  s p and moody s  and a decline in any of these ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease  above 
the syndicate capital setting process within amal is subject to fsa rules but is conducted by lloyd s under its detailed procedures 
lloyd s could request an increase in capital under the fsa rules 
table of contents in similar circumstances as set out above in the section on aspen uk lloyd s as whole  including syndicate  is also subject to the provisions of solvency ii as noted above 
potential changes to the us regulatory system could have an adverse effect on the business of our us operating companies 
aspen specialty is organized in and has received a license to write certain lines of insurance business in the state of north dakota and  as a result  is subject to north dakota law and regulation under the supervision of the ndci 
aaic is organized in texas and has licenses to write property and casualty insurance business on an admitted basis in all states and the district of columbia 
north dakota and texas also have regulatory authority over a number of affiliate transactions between the insurance companies and other members of our holding company system 
the purpose of the state insurance regulatory statutes is to protect us policyholders  not our shareholders or noteholders 
among other matters  state insurance regulations will require aspen entities to maintain minimum levels of capital  surplus and liquidity  require insurers to comply with applicable risk based capital requirements and will impose restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions 
these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict the ability of aspen entities in the us to write new business or distribute assets to aspen holdings 
recently  the naic adopted revisions to its model law and regulation relating to insurance holding companies 
a number of states have adopted or are considering adopting proposals to amend their insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of regulation 
the amendments address a number of standards that affect insurance holding company systems  including corporate governance  group wide supervision  accounting for group wide risks in risk based capital calculations and imposition of additional disclosure obligations 
as the naic continues its solvency modernization initiative  additional changes may be made to solvency regulations in various state laws and regulations 
in recent years  the us insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
in addition  the us congress has enacted legislation providing a greater role for the federal government in the regulation of insurance 
moreover  the naic and state insurance regulators regularly examine existing laws and regulations 
new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
changes in us state insurance legislation and insurance department legislation may impact liabilities assumed by our business 
aspen specialty  aaic  aspen uk and various affiliates are subject to periodic changes in us state insurance legislation and insurance department regulation which may materially affect the liabilities assumed by the companies in such states 
for example  as a result of natural disasters  emergency orders and related regulations may be periodically issued or enacted by individual states 
this may impact the cancellation or non renewal of property policies issued in those states for an extended period of time  increasing the potential liability to the company on such extended policies 
failure to adhere to these regulations could result in the imposition of fines  fees  penalties and loss of approval to write business in such states 
certain states with catastrophe exposures eg  california earthquakes  florida hurricanes have opted to establish state run  state owned reinsurers that compete with us and our peers 
these entities tend to reduce the amount of business available to us 

table of contents from time to time  government authorities seek to more closely monitor and regulate the insurance industry  which may adversely affect our business 
the attorneys general for multiple states and other insurance regulatory authorities have previously investigated a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry  and in particular insurance brokerage compensation practices 
to the extent that state regulation of brokers and intermediaries becomes more onerous  costs of regulatory compliance for aspen management  asis  aspen re america and ara ca will increase 
finally  to the extent that any of the brokers with whom we do business suffer financial difficulties as a result of the investigations or proceedings  we could suffer increased credit risk 
see since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our insurance and reinsurance revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us above 
these investigations of the insurance industry in general  whether involving the company specifically or not  together with any legal or regulatory proceedings  related settlements and industry reform or other changes arising therefrom  may materially adversely affect our business and future financial results or operating results 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that are more difficult than companies operating outside the financial sector 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  impairments  income taxes  contingencies  derivatives and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like us  are more difficult to make than those made for a more mature company because we have more limited historical information through december  a significant part of our current loss reserves is in respect of ibnr 
this ibnr reserve is based almost entirely on estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs 
in addition to limited historical information  we utilize actuarial models as well as historical insurance industry loss development patterns to establish loss reserves 
accordingly  actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments  particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  net equity and other relevant financial statement line items 
in 
table of contents particular  the us financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb have been working jointly on an insurance contract project  resulting in the issuance of an exposure draft by the iasb in june and a discussion paper by the fasb in september fasb and iasb are deliberating significant issues based on feedback received to iasb s exposure draft and fasb s discussion paper 
the proposed guidance on accounting for and reporting of insurance contracts by these two boards would result in a material change from the current insurance accounting models toward more fair value based models 
additionally  each board recently issued exposure drafts for the accounting for and reporting of financial instruments  which may lead to further recognition of fair value changes through net income 
these two proposals could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants 
there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the final outcome of these two proposed standards 
other operational risks we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our senior underwriters or principal employees or by an inability to attract and retain senior staff 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend in substantial part  upon our ability to attract and retain our teams of underwriters in various business lines and other key employees 
the loss of one or more of our senior underwriters could adversely impact our business by  for example  making it more difficult to retain clients or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing personnel 
in addition  the loss of services of underwriters could strain our ability to execute our new business lines  as described elsewhere in this report 
in general  the loss of key services of any members of our current underwriting teams may adversely affect our business and operating results 
we also rely substantially upon the services of our senior management team 
although we have employment agreements with all of the members of our senior management team  if we were to unexpectedly lose the services of one or more of the members of our senior management team or other key personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
changes in employment laws  taxation and acceptable compensation practice may limit our ability to attract senior employees to our current operating platforms 
our insurance and reinsurance operations are  by their nature  international and we compete for senior employees on a global basis 
changes in employment legislation  taxation and the approach of regulatory bodies to compensation practice within our operating jurisdictions may impact our ability to recruit or retain senior employees or the cost to us of doing so 
any failure to retain senior employees may adversely affect the strategic growth of our business and the operating results 
we may be adversely affected by action taken against us by former employers of our staff who allege that their former employees may be in breach of legal obligations to them 
within our industry it is common for employers to seek to restrict an employee s ability either to work for a competitor or to engage in business activities with the customers or staff of a former employer after leaving employment 
in addition  our employees may owe statutory or fiduciary obligations to former employers 
the extent of any such post termination restrictions and the extent to 
table of contents which any alleged contractual restrictions are enforceable is highly fact specific and dependent upon the local laws in the applicable jurisdiction in any case 
action taken by former employers to enforce such restrictions  however  even if ultimately found not to be legally binding  may adversely affect our ability to pursue current business objectives 
we rely on third party service providers for some of our operations and systems 
we rely on third party service providers for a variety of services and systems  which include  but are not limited to  claims handling activity  support on our underwriting and finance systems  investment management and catastrophe modeling 
if our third party service providers fail to perform as expected  it could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations 
our business is dependent upon our employees and outsourcers ability to perform  in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  necessary business functions  such as processing policies and paying claims 
a shutdown of  or inability to access  one or more of our facilities  a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology  telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis 
computer viruses  cyberattacks  other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information  corruption of data or operational disruption 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption  system failure  service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely fashion or perform other necessary business functions 
we do not perform online customer transactions and our externally accessible systems are for staff remote access use only 
nevertheless  we continually monitor risks to our information technology  telecommunications and other systems and believe we have the necessary measures appropriate to prevent and manage those risks 
our key technologies are largely resilient and secure in line with current financial services best practice 
risks related to our ordinary shares our ability to pay dividends or to meet ongoing cash requirements may be constrained by our holding company structure 
we are a holding company and  as such  we do not expect to have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the shares of our operating subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions and loans from our operating subsidiaries are expected to be our sole source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including our debt service payments and other expenses  and dividend payments  to our preference and ordinary shareholders  as appropriate 
our operating subsidiaries are subject to capital and other requirements that inform their ability to declare and pay dividends and make loans to other group companies 
these requirements may mean that our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends to enable us to meet our ongoing cash requirements 
see business regulatory matters bermuda regulation restrictions on dividends and distributions  business regulatory matters uk and uk regulation restrictions on dividend payments  and business regulatory matters us regulation state dividend limitations in item  above 

table of contents certain regulatory and other constraints may limit our ability to pay dividends 
we are subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that affect our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make other distributions 
under the bermuda companies act  we may declare or pay a dividend out of contributed surplus only if we have reasonable grounds to believe that we are  and would after the payment be  able to meet our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
for more information regarding restrictions on the payment of dividends by us and our operating subsidiaries  see business regulatory matters in item  above and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity in part ii  item there are provisions in our charter documents which may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares 
in general  and except as provided below  shareholders have one vote for each ordinary share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders 
however  if  and so long as  the ordinary shares of a shareholder are treated as controlled shares as determined under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code of any us person as defined below and such controlled shares constitute or more of the votes conferred by our issued shares  the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares of such us person a us shareholder shall be limited  in the aggregate  to a voting power of less than  under a formula specified in our bye laws

in addition  the board may limit a shareholder s voting rights including appointment rights  if any  granted to holders of our perpetual preferred income equity replacement securities the perpetual piers or to holders of our perpetual non cumulative preference shares or perpetual non cumulative preference shares liquidation preference per share collectively  the perpetual preference shares where it deems it appropriate to do so to i avoid the existence of any us shareholder  and ii avoid certain material adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us or any holder of our shares or its affiliates 
controlled shares includes  among other things  all shares of the company that such us person is deemed to own directly  indirectly or constructively within the meaning of section of the code 
as of december   there were  ordinary shares outstanding of which  ordinary shares would constitute of the votes conferred by our issued and outstanding shares 
for purposes of this discussion  the term us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a partnership or corporation  or entity treated as a corporation  created or organized in or under the laws of the united states  or any political subdivision thereof  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source  or iv a trust if either x a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or y the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes or z any other person or entity that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing 
under these provisions  certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share  while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share 
see part ii  item  market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer 
table of contents purchaser of equity securities bye laws 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
our bye laws provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by them 
as a result of any reallocation of votes  voting rights of some of our shareholders might increase above of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares  thereby possibly resulting in such shareholders becoming a reporting person subject to schedule d or g filing requirements under the exchange act 
in addition  the reallocation of the votes of our shareholders could result in some of the shareholders becoming subject to filing requirements under section of the exchange act 
we also have the authority under our bye laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be reallocated under the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate such shareholder s voting rights 
there are provisions in our bye laws which may restrict the ability to transfer ordinary shares and which may require shareholders to sell their ordinary shares 
the board may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares if it appears to the board  in its sole and reasonable discretion  after taking into account the limitations on voting rights contained in our bye laws  that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders or their affiliates may occur as a result of such transfer 
our bye laws also provide that if the board determines that share ownership by a person may result in material adverse tax consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any shareholder or its affiliates  then we have the option  but not the obligation  to require that shareholder to sell to us or to third parties to whom we assign the repurchase right for fair market value the minimum number of ordinary shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the material adverse tax consequences 
anti takeover provisions in our bye law and laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we conduct business could delay or deter a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider to be desirable and may make it more difficult to replace members of our board 
our bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
for example  these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our ordinary shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future 
for example  our bye laws contain the following provisions that could have such an effect election of directors is staggered  meaning that members of only one of three classes of directors are elected each year  directors serve for a term of three years unless aged years or older  
table of contents our directors may decline to approve or register any transfer of shares to the extent they determine  in their sole discretion  that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to aspen holdings  any of its subsidiaries  shareholders or affiliates would result from such transfer  if our directors determine that share ownership by any person may result in material adverse tax consequences to aspen holdings  any of its subsidiaries  shareholders or affiliates  we have the option  but not the obligation  to purchase or assign to a third party the right to purchase the minimum number of shares held by such person solely to the extent that it is necessary to eliminate such material risk  shareholders have limited ability to remove directors  and if the ordinary shares of any us person constitute or more of the votes conferred by the issued shares of aspen holdings  the voting rights with respect to the controlled shares of such us person shall be limited  in the aggregate  to a voting power of less than 
in addition  as described under part i  item  business regulatory matters  prospective shareholders are required to notify our regulators on becoming controllers of any of our operating subsidiaries through ownership of aspen holdings shares above certain thresholds  typically of outstanding shares 
some regulators  such as the fsa  require their approval prior to such shareholder becoming a controller 
other regulators may serve a notice of objection or are entitled to injunctive relief 
there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned greater than of our ordinary shares did not  because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares  control the applicable operating subsidiary 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable 
if these restrictions delay  deter or prevent a change of control  such restrictions may make it more difficult to replace members of our board and may have the effect of entrenching management regardless of their performance 
we cannot pay a dividend on our ordinary shares unless the full dividends for the most recently ended dividend period on all outstanding perpetual piers  underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares have been declared and paid 
our perpetual piers  our perpetual preference shares that are issuable upon conversion of our perpetual piers at the option of the holders thereof and our perpetual preference shares will rank senior to our ordinary shares with respect to the payment of dividends 
as a result  unless the full dividends for the most recently ended dividend period on all outstanding perpetual piers  underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares have been declared and paid or declared and a sum or  if we so elect with respect to our perpetual piers and underlying perpetual preference shares  ordinary shares sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside  we cannot declare or pay a dividend on our ordinary shares 
under the terms of our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares  these restrictions will continue until full dividends on all outstanding perpetual piers  underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares for four consecutive dividend periods have been declared and paid or declared and a sum or  if we so elect with respect to our perpetual piers and underlying perpetual preference shares  ordinary shares sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment 

table of contents our ordinary shares rank junior to our perpetual piers  underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares in the event of a liquidation  winding up or dissolution of the company 
in the event of a liquidation  winding up or dissolution of the company  our ordinary shares rank junior to our perpetual piers  our perpetual preference shares issuable upon conversion of our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares 
in such an event  there may not be sufficient assets remaining  after payments to holders of our perpetual piers  underlying perpetual preference shares and perpetual preference shares  to ensure payments to holders of ordinary shares 
us persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us persons who are shareholders of a us corporation 
the companies act  which applies to us  differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
set forth below is a summary of certain significant provisions of the companies act which includes  where relevant  information on modifications thereto adopted under our bye laws  applicable to us  which differ in certain respects from provisions of delaware corporate law the state that is most renowned for its corporate law statutes 
because the following statements are summaries  they do not discuss all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to us and our shareholders 
interested directors 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  a transaction entered into by us  in which a director has an interest  will not be voidable by us  and such director will not be accountable to us for any benefit realized under that transaction  provided the nature of the interest is disclosed at the first opportunity at a meeting of directors  or in writing  to the directors 
in addition  our bye laws allow a director to be taken into account in determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which that director has an interest following a declaration of the interest under the companies act  unless the majority of the disinterested directors determine otherwise 
under delaware law  the transaction would not be voidable if the material facts as to the interested director s relationship or interests were disclosed or were known to the board and the board in good faith authorized the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors  the material facts were disclosed or were known to the shareholders entitled to vote on such transaction and the transaction was specifically approved in good faith by vote of the majority of shares entitled to vote thereon  or the transaction was fair as to the corporation at the time it was authorized  approved or ratified 
business combinations with large shareholders or affiliates 
as a bermuda company  we may enter into business combinations with our large shareholders or one or more wholly owned subsidiaries  including asset sales and other transactions in which a large shareholder or a wholly owned subsidiary receives  or could receive  a financial benefit that is greater than that received  or to be received  by other shareholders or other wholly owned subsidiaries  without obtaining prior approval from our shareholders and without special approval from the board 
under bermuda law  amalgamations and mergers require the approval of the board  and except in the case of amalgamations with and between wholly owned subsidiaries  shareholder approval 
however  when the affairs of a bermuda company are being conducted in a manner which is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some shareholders  one or more shareholders may apply to a bermuda court  which 
table of contents may make an order as it sees fit  including an order regulating the conduct of the company s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or the company 
if we were a delaware company  we would need prior approval from the board or a supermajority of our shareholders to enter into a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder  unless we opted out of the relevant delaware statute 
bermuda law or our bye laws would require the board s approval and  in some instances  shareholder approval of such transactions 
shareholders suits 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
however  the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to commence a derivative action in our name to remedy a wrong done to us where an act is alleged to be beyond our corporate power  is illegal or would result in the violation of our memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
our bye laws provide that shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in the right of the company  against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of such director s or officer s duties  except with respect to any fraud or dishonesty of the director or officer or to recover any gain  personal profit or advantage to which the director or officer is not legally entitled 
class actions and derivative actions generally are available to shareholders under delaware law for  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law 
in such actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
indemnification of directors and officers 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  we may indemnify our directors  officers  any other person appointed to a committee of the board or resident representative and their respective heirs  executors or administrators to the full extent permitted by law against all actions  costs  charges  liabilities  loss  damage or expense  incurred or suffered by such persons by reason of any act done  conceived in or omitted in the conduct of our business or in the discharge of their duties  provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any matter which would render such indemnification void under the companies act 
under delaware law  a corporation may indemnify a director or officer of the corporation against expenses including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in defense of an action  suit or proceeding by reason of such position if i such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and ii with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  such director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful 
we are a bermuda company and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  certain of our directors and officers reside outside the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
as such  it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon us or those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of us courts  including judgments predicated 
table of contents upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we have been advised by bermuda counsel that there is no treaty in force between the us and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a us judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the us court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
a judgment debt from a us court that is final and for a sum certain based on us federal securities laws will not be enforceable in bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the us court  and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of bermuda not us law 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  the bermuda courts will not enforce a us federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy 
it is the advice of our bermuda counsel that an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity  will not be entertained by a bermuda court 
certain remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including certain remedies under us federal securities laws  would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
risks related to taxation our non us companies other than aul may be subject to non us income tax and that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and your investment 
if aspen holdings or any of its non us subsidiaries other than aul were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states  it could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such us business  in which case its operating results could be materially adversely affected although its operating results should not be materially adversely affected if aspen uk is considered to be engaged in a us trade or business solely as a result of the binding authorities granted to aspen re america  ara ca  asis  aspen management and aspen solutions 
aspen holdings  aspen bermuda and acorn are bermuda companies  aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj  aspen recoveries and aussl are uk companies and apj jersey is a jersey company 
we intend to manage our business so that each of these companies other than aul will operate in such a manner that none of these companies should be subject to us tax other than us excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring us risks and us withholding tax on certain 
table of contents us source investment income  and the likely imposition of us corporate income and additional branch profits tax on the profits attributable to the business of aspen uk produced pursuant to the binding authorities granted to aspen re america  ara ca  asis  aspen solutions and aspen management  as well as the binding authorities previously granted to wellington underwriting inc wu inc 
because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the united states other than aspen uk with respect to the business produced pursuant to the aspen re america  ara ca  asis  aspen management and prior wu inc binding authorities agreements 
however  because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  we cannot be certain that the us internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that some or all of aspen holdings or its non us subsidiaries other than aul is are engaged in a trade or business in the united states based on activities in addition to the binding authorities discussed above 
aul is a member of lloyd s and subject to a closing agreement between lloyd s and the irs the closing agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the closing agreement all members of lloyd s  including aul  are subject to us federal income taxation 
those members that are entitled to the benefits of a us income tax treaty are deemed to be engaged in a us trade or business through a us permanent establishment 
those members not entitled to the benefits of such a treaty are merely deemed to be engaged in a us trade or business 
the closing agreement provides rules for determining the income considered to be attributable to the permanent establishment or us trade or business 
we believe that aul may be entitled to the benefits of the us income tax treaty with the uk the uk treaty  although the position is not certain 
our non uk companies may be subject to non uk tax that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
none of our subsidiaries  except for aspen uk holdings  aspen uk  aspen uk services  amal  aul  aiuk trustees  arml  apj  aspen recoveries and aussl collectively  the uk subsidiaries  is incorporated in the united kingdom 
accordingly  none of us  other than the uk subsidiaries  should be treated as being resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes except for apj jersey which  although not incorporated in the united kingdom  is treated as resident in the united kingdom as a result of its central management and control being exercised from the united kingdom 
each of us  other than the uk subsidiaries and apj jersey  currently intends to manage our affairs so that none of us  other than the uk subsidiaries and apj jersey  is resident in the united kingdom for tax purposes 
a company not resident in the united kingdom for corporation tax purposes can nevertheless be subject to uk corporation tax if it carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom but the charge to uk corporation tax is limited to profits including revenue profits and capital gains attributable directly or indirectly to such permanent establishment 
each of us  other than the uk subsidiaries and apj jersey  currently intends that we will operate in such a manner so that none of us other than the uk subsidiaries and apj jersey  carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom 
nevertheless  because neither case law nor uk statute definitively defines the activities that constitute trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment  her majesty s revenue and customs might contend successfully that any of us other than the uk subsidiaries and apj jersey are trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment 

table of contents the united kingdom has no income tax treaty with bermuda 
there are circumstances in which companies that are neither resident in the united kingdom nor entitled to the protection afforded by a double tax treaty between the united kingdom and the jurisdiction in which they are resident may be exposed to income tax in the united kingdom other than by deduction or withholding on the profits of a trade carried on there even if that trade is not carried on through a permanent establishment but each of us intends that we will operate in such a manner that none of us will fall within the charge to income tax in the united kingdom other than by deduction or withholding in this respect 
if any of us  other than the uk subsidiaries and apj jersey  were treated as being resident in the united kingdom for uk corporation tax purposes  or as carrying on a trade in the united kingdom  whether or not through a permanent establishment  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our uk operations may be affected by future changes in uk tax law 
the uk subsidiaries and apj jersey should be treated as resident in the united kingdom and accordingly be subject to uk tax in respect of their worldwide income and gains 
any change in the basis or rate of uk corporation tax could materially adversely affect the operations of the uk companies 
the uk corporation tax rate has reduced from to with effect from april   and will further reduce to with effect from april  our uk and uk operations may be adversely affected by a transfer pricing adjustment in computing uk or uk taxable profits 
any arrangements between uk resident entities of the aspen group and other members of the aspen group are subject to the uk transfer pricing regime 
consequently  if any agreement including any reinsurance agreements between a uk resident entity of the aspen group and any other aspen group entity whether that entity is resident in or outside the uk is found not to be on arm s length terms and as a result a uk tax advantage is being obtained  an adjustment will be required to compute uk taxable profits as if such an agreement were on arm s length terms 
similar rules apply in the u 
s and would have a similar impact on our us resident entities if transfer pricing adjustments were required 
any transfer pricing adjustment could adversely impact the tax charge suffered by the relevant uk or us resident entities of the aspen group 
holders of or more of aspen holdings shares may be subject to us income taxation under the controlled foreign corporation cfc rules 
if you are a us shareholder defined as a us person as defined below who owns directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively as defined below at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a non us corporation  that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and you own shares in the non u 
s corporation directly or indirectly through non us entities on the last day of the non us corporation s taxable year on which it is a cfc  you must include in your gross income for us federal income tax purposes your pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
subpart f income of a non us insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income such as interest  dividends and other types of passive income  as well as insurance and reinsurance income including underwriting and investment 
table of contents income 
a non us corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own directly  indirectly through us entities or by attribution by application of the constructive ownership rules of section b of the code ie  constructively more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of that non us corporation  or the total value of all stock of that non us corporation 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a non us corporation earning insurance income in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned by us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts other than certain insurance or reinsurance related to some country risks written by certain insurance companies  not applicable here exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
for purposes of this discussion  the term us person means i a citizen or resident of the united states  ii a partnership or corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the united states  or organized under the laws of any political subdivision thereof  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source  iv a trust if either x a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or y the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes and v any other person or entity that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as if it were one of the foregoing 
we believe that because of the anticipated dispersion of our share ownership  provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power these provisions are described under bye laws in part ii  item below and other factors  no us person who owns shares of aspen holdings directly or indirectly through one or more non us entities should be treated as owning directly  indirectly through non us entities  or constructively or more of the total voting power of all classes of shares of aspen holdings or any of its non us subsidiaries 
it is possible  however  that the irs could successfully challenge the effectiveness of these provisions 
us persons who hold our shares may be subject to us income taxation at ordinary income rates on their proportionate share of our related party insurance income rpii 
if the rpii determined on a gross basis of any of our non us operating subsidiaries were to equal or exceed of that company s gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds and persons related to those insureds own directly or indirectly through entities or more of the voting power or value of aspen holdings  then a us person who owns any shares of such non us operating subsidiary directly or indirectly through non us entities on the last day of the taxable year on which it is an rpii cfc would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes such person s pro rata share of such company s rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to us persons at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed  in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
the amount of rpii earned by a non us operating subsidiary generally  premium and related investment income from the indirect or direct insurance or reinsurance of any direct or indirect us holder of shares or any person related to such holder will depend on a number of factors  including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or 
table of contents reinsured by the company 
we believe that the direct or indirect insureds of each of our non us operating subsidiaries and related persons did not directly or indirectly own or more of either the voting power or value of our shares in prior years of operation and we do not expect this to be the case in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we do not expect gross rpii of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries to equal or exceed of its gross insurance income in any taxable year for the foreseeable future  but we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of rpii may be beyond our control 
us persons who dispose of our shares may be subject to us federal income taxation at the rates applicable to dividends on a portion of such disposition 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  in conjunction with the rpii rules provides that if a us person disposes of shares in a non us corporation that earns insurance income in which us persons own or more of the shares even if the amount of gross rpii is less than of the corporation s gross insurance income and the ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons is less than the threshold  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
in addition  such a holder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the holder 
these rpii rules should not apply to dispositions of our shares because aspen holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii provisions  however  have never been interpreted by the courts or the treasury department in final regulations  and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes or clarifications might ultimately be made thereto or whether any such changes  as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs  the courts  or otherwise  might have retroactive effect 
the treasury department has authority to impose  among other things  additional reporting requirements with respect to rpii 
accordingly  the meaning of the rpii provisions and the application thereof to us is uncertain 
us persons who hold our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
if we are considered a pfic for us federal income tax purposes  a us person who owns any of our shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed  in which case your investment could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if we were considered a pfic  upon the death of any us individual owning shares  such individual s heirs or estate would not be entitled to a step up in the basis of the shares that might otherwise be available under us federal income tax laws 
we believe that we are not  have not been  and currently do not expect to become  a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be deemed a pfic by the irs 
if we were considered a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation 

table of contents us tax exempt organizations who own our shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income 
a us tax exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of the insurance income of any of our non us operating subsidiaries is allocated to the organization  which generally would be the case if any of our non us operating subsidiaries is a cfc and the tax exempt shareholder is a us shareholder or there is rpii  certain exceptions do not apply and the tax exempt organization owns any of our shares 
although we do not believe that any us persons should be allocated such insurance income  we cannot be certain that this will be the case 
us tax exempt investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors 
changes in us federal income tax law or the manner in which it is interpreted could materially adversely affect us 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states  but have certain us connections 
it is possible that legislation could be introduced in and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us 
in addition  existing interpretations of us federal income tax laws could change  also resulting in an adverse impact on us 
scope of application of recently enacted legislation is uncertain 
congress enacted legislation in known as the foreign account tax compliance act fatca provisions 
these provisions require withholding agents to withhold of a us source payment made to a foreign financial institution ffi unless the ffi has entered into an agreement with the irs to report account information for any of the ffi s us accountholders 
final regulations were issued by the us treasury on january  the us treasury has released models for intergovernmental fatca agreements igas with other jurisdictions that will allow ffis in those jurisdictions to report us accountholder information only to local revenue authorities rather than the irs 
the uk uk iga was signed in september irs announcement  released in october provided a number of updates to various fatca implementation deadlines 
the principle commencement date is january  as a result  non publicly traded securities holders may be required to provide any information that we determine necessary to avoid the imposition of such withholding tax in order to allow us to satisfy such obligations 
in the event that this withholding tax is imposed  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
potential fbar reporting and reporting of specified foreign financial assets 
us persons holding our shares should consider their possible obligation to file an irs form td f foreign bank and financial accounts report with respect to their shares 
additionally  such us and us persons should consider their possible obligations to annually report certain information with respect to us with their us federal income tax returns 
shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these or any other reporting requirement which may apply with respect to their ownership of our shares 

table of contents the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s progress report dated april   bermuda was designated as an oecd white list jurisdiction that has substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standards 
the standards for the oecd compliance are to have at least signed tax information exchange agreements tieas with other oecd members or non oecd members 
as at december   bermuda had signed tieas which exceeds the requisite amount and demonstrates bermuda s commitment to preserve the standards 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
changes to bermuda tax policies may impact our financial position 
the duration of the assurance granted to us under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended is limited and expires on march  tax policy and legislation in bermuda could change in the future as is the case in other jurisdictions and as such no guarantee can be given as to whether the current tax treatment afforded to us will continue after march  additional information aspen s website address is www

corporate purpose 
our certificate of incorporation  memorandum of association and our bye laws do not restrict our corporate purpose and objects 
investor options upon our formation in june  we issued to the names trustee  as trustee of the names trust for the benefit of the unaligned members of syndicate the unaligned members  options to purchase  non voting shares the names options 
all non voting shares issued or to be issued upon the exercise of the names options will automatically convert into ordinary shares at a one to one ratio upon issuance 
the rights of the holders of the names options are governed by an option instrument dated june   which was amended and restated on december  and further amended and restated on september   to effect certain of the provisions described below the option instrument 
the names options could be exercised in whole or in part 
all options were exercised prior to the expiry date of june  the names options were exercisable without regard to a minimum number of options to be exercised  at a sale as defined in the option instrument and on a monthly basis beginning in october expiring on june  following notification by the unaligned members to the names trustee of their elections to exercise the names options 
the exercise price payable for each option share was  together with interest accruing at per annum less any dividends or other distributions from the date of issue of the names options june  until the date of exercise of the names options 
each optionholder could exercise its options on a cashless basis  subject to relevant requirements of the companies act 
a cashless exercise would allow the optionholders to realize  through the receipt of ordinary shares  the economic benefit of the difference between the subscription price under the names options and the then prevailing 
table of contents market prices without having to pay the subscription price for any such ordinary shares 
as a result  the optionholder would receive fewer shares upon exercise 
for any exercise of the names options on a cashless basis  the number of ordinary shares to be issued would be based on the difference between the exercise price on the date of exercise and the then prevailing market price of the ordinary shares  calculated using the average closing price for five preceding trading days 
following the issuance of the names options  there were a range of anti dilution protections for the optionholders if any issuance or reclassification of our shares or similar matters are effected below fair market value  subject to certain exceptions 
under these circumstances  an adjustment to the subscription rights of the optionholders or the subscription price of the names options would be made by the board 
if optionholders holding or more of the rights to subscribe for non voting shares under the names options requested  any adjustment proposed by the board may be referred to independent financial advisors for their determination
