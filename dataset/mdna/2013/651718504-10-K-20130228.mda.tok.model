item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
overview we are a diversified oil and gas industry supplier providing products and services primarily to the oil and gas exploration and production e p industry 
we operate our business through three reportable segments fluids systems and engineering  mats and integrated services  and environmental services 
our fluids systems and engineering segment  which generated of consolidated revenues in  provides customized drilling fluids solutions to e p customers globally  operating through four geographic regions north america  europe  the middle east and africa emea  latin america  and asia pacific 
our mats and integrated services segment  which generated of consolidated revenues in  provides composite mat rentals  well site construction and related site services to oil and gas customers and mat rentals to the petrochemicals industry in the us and the utility industry in the uk we also sell composite mats to e p customers outside of the us  and to domestic customers outside of the oil and gas industry 
our environmental services segment  which generated of consolidated revenues in  processes and disposes of waste primarily generated by e p customers along the us gulf coast 
during  we have continued the roll out of evolution  our high performance water based drilling fluid system launched in  which we believe provides superior performance and environmental benefits to our customers  as compared to traditional fluids systems used in the industry 
after the initial introduction into the haynesville shale in  the system is now being used by customers in most major north american drilling basins 
in addition  the first evolution well in the emea region was drilled in the fourth quarter of revenues from wells using the evolution system were approximately million in  up from million in on december   we completed the acquisition of substantially all assets and operations of alliance drilling fluids  llc alliance  a provider of drilling fluids  proppant distribution  and related services headquartered in midland  texas 
total cash consideration at closing was approximately million  which was funded through borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
the purchase price is subject to further adjustments  based upon actual working capital conveyed 
additional consideration up to million may be payable based on the profitability of the proppant distribution business over the two year period following the acquisition 
alliance recorded revenues of million and operating income of million for the year ended december   of which approximately of revenue and of operating income was attributable to the proppant business 
in april  we completed the acquisition of the drilling fluids and engineering services business from rheochem plc  a publicly traded australian based oil and gas company 
the acquired business provides drilling fluids and related engineering services with operations in australia  new zealand and india 
total cash paid in was aud million million 
during  the final payment was made which totaled aud million million reflecting additional consideration required based on financial results of the acquired business over a one year earn out period ending february in  this business generated million of revenues  or of our consolidated revenues 
our operating results depend  to a large extent  on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as the nature of the drilling operations including the depth and whether the wells are drilled vertically or horizontally  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
the drilling activity in turn  depends on oil and gas commodity pricing  inventory levels and demand  and regulatory actions  such as those affecting operations in the gulf of mexico in recent years 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
average north american rig count data for the last three years ended december is as follows year ended december  vs vs count count us rig count canadian rig count total source baker hughes incorporated while the average total north america rig count has decreased by only from to  there has been a significant regional shift in us activity over this period 
this shift from dry gas drilling to oil and liquid rich drilling resulted in a significant decline in several key dry gas basins  including the haynesville shale east texas  barnett east texas  marcellus shale pennsylvania and areas in the rockies  largely offset by increases in oil and liquid rich basins  including the bakken north dakota  eagle ford south texas  mississippian lime mid continent and permian basin west texas 
during periods of rapid transition such as  operating expenses within our us business units were elevated  as we re deployed personnel and assets among regions and modified our regional business unit infrastructures to meet the changing activity levels 
outside of north america  drilling activity is generally more stable than north america  as drilling activity in many countries is based upon longer term economic projections and multiple year drilling programs  which tend to minimize the impact of short term changes of commodity prices on overall drilling activity 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated results of operations summarized results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are as follows year ended december  vs in thousands revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses other operating income  net operating income foreign currency exchange loss interest expense  net income from operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues increased to billion in  compared to million in this million improvement includes a million increase in revenues in north america  largely driven by improved drilling efficiency  which results in an increased number of customer wells drilled per rig  along with strong demand for the purchase of our composite mat products from customers outside of the e p industry 
revenues from our international operations increased million including a million increase from our asia pacific business unit  which was acquired in april of additional information regarding the change in revenues is provided within the operating segment results below 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily driven by the increase in revenues along with elevated operating expenses in driven by the shift in activity from dry gas to liquid rich regions in the us additional information regarding the change in cost of revenues is provided within the operating segment results below 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase in spending is largely attributable to costs associated with our fourth quarter enterprise resource planning erp system conversion in the us operations 
foreign currency exchange foreign currency exchange was a million loss in  compared to a million loss in  and primarily reflects the impact of currency translations on assets and liabilities held in our foreign operations that are denominated in currencies other than functional currencies 
interest expense  net interest expense  which primarily reflects the interest associated with our million in unsecured convertible notes senior notes  was million in  compared to in the increased interest expense in is primarily due to the impact of increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the us provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in was million  reflecting an effective tax rate of  compared to million in  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate includes a million charge in associated with a tax assessment and related increase in tax rate for the period of through in a foreign subsidiary  which was partially offset by additional us tax deductions that became available after our us federal net operating loss carryforwards were exhausted in operating segment results summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in the following table net of inter segment transfers year ended december  vs in thousands revenues fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total revenues operating income loss fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services corporate office operating income segment operating margin fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands united states canada total north america emea latin america asia pacific total north american revenues increased to million in  compared to million in  although north america rig count was down over this period 
this increase in revenues is largely attributable to improved drilling efficiency achieved by our customers  which is reflected in an increased number of wells drilled per rig 
the growth in several north american basins was partially offset by a million decline in our completion services and equipment rental revenues in the mid continent region  which was primarily attributable to increased competition 
internationally  revenues were up to million in  compared to million in this increase includes a million increase in revenues from our asia pacific region following the april acquisition described above  along with an million increase in brazil  driven by increased activities with petrobras and international oil company customers 
operating income operating income for this segment was million  reflecting an operating margin of in  compared to million and an operating margin in substantially all of this million operating income decline is attributable to our north america operations  despite a million increase in revenues 
the decline in operating income includes a million decrease in the completion services and equipment rental business associated with the million revenue decline in that business as described above 
due to the relatively fixed nature of operating expenses in this service and equipment rental business unit  the incremental operating income impact from the decline in these revenues is higher than what is typically experienced in this segment 
in addition  includes elevated costs associated with an erp system conversion in the us operations which began in the fourth quarter of and operating cost increases associated with our customer transition away from dry gas regions into oil and liquid rich regions  as described above 
operating income from our international operations increased million on a million increase in revenues 
increases from our asia pacific and latin america regions were partially offset by a decline in the emea region  as the emea region was negatively impacted by increased personnel and operating costs in north africa  partially associated with the transition to new contracts in algeria 
mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and services mat sales total mat rental and services revenues decreased million in compared to the prior year  as a million decline in the northeast us was partially offset by a million increase in the us gulf coast  a million increase in the rocky mountain region  and a million increase in our international rental business 
mat sales increased by million  primarily due to higher demand for our durabase composite mat products from non e p customers  including the utility industry and the us military 
operating income segment operating income increased by million on the million increase in revenues  reflecting an incremental margin of 
the low incremental margin is primarily attributable to the higher mix of mat sales relative to rental activity 
due to the fixed nature of operating expenses in the rental business  including depreciation expense on our rental mat fleet  the decremental margin associated with the decline in rental and service revenues is much higher than the incremental margin associated with the increase in mat sales 
as noted above  mat sales increased in as a result of continued strong demand for our mats from both e p and non e p customers  including the utility industry and the us military 
the levels of mats sales in a period are determined by several factors  including customer demand  as well as our allocation of mat production between sales and deployment into our rental fleet 
the allocation of our production between additions to our rental fleet and sales in any given period is driven by a number of factors including commitments to meeting customer schedules  ability of our customers to take delivery of mats  timing of large mat rental projects events  and plant capacity efficiencies 
we expect mat sales to decline in early from the levels achieved in  partially due to our decision to deploy additional mats into our rental fleet 
as a result  segment revenue and operating income are expected to decline from the levels achieved in environmental services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands e p waste norm and industrial waste total environmental services revenues increased to million in  compared to million in e p waste revenues increased by million  primarily due to the increased offshore drilling activity along the us gulf coast 
norm and industrial waste revenues declined by million  primarily due to the impact of large disposal projects in  which did not recur in operating income operating income for this segment increased by million from to  on a million increase in revenues  reflecting an incremental margin of 
corporate office corporate office expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in the decrease is primarily driven by a million decline in performance based employee incentive costs partially offset by increased costs following our fourth quarter erp system conversion in our us operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated results of operations summarized results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are as follows year ended december  vs in thousands revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses other operating income  net operating income foreign currency exchange loss gain interest expense  net income from operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues increased to million in  compared to million in this million improvement includes a million increase in revenues in north america  largely driven by the improvement in the north america rig count 
revenues from our international operations increased by million reflecting the contribution of the asia pacific region  following our april acquisition  along with continued growth in brazil 
additional information regarding the change in revenues is provided within the operating segment results below 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase is primarily driven by the increase in revenues 
additional information regarding the change in cost of revenues is provided within the operating segment results below 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase includes a million increase in performance based employee incentive compensation expense 
in addition  includes million of expenses incurred within the acquired asia pacific business  million of transaction related expenditures for this acquisition  million of costs associated with strategic planning projects  and million of implementation expenses associated with an operational and financial system conversion in the us operations 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to additional costs required to support the increase in revenues 
other operating income  net other operating income was million in  compared to million in the results included a million gain  reflecting net proceeds from the settlement of a lawsuit and proceeds from the insurance claims in our mats and integrated services segment 
foreign currency exchange foreign currency exchange was a million loss in  compared to a million gain in  and primarily reflects the impact of currency translations on assets and liabilities held in our foreign operations that are denominated in currencies other than functional currencies 
our foreign operations have a portion of their cash and accounts receivable that are denominated in us dollars 
during  our foreign currency exchange transactions were favorably impacted by the weakening us dollar as compared to other currencies in our foreign operations  while was negatively impacted by the strengthening us dollar 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in  compared to million in the fiscal year included a million charge for the termination of our interest rate swap agreements 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for was million  reflecting an effective tax rate of  compared to million in  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the high effective tax rate in was due to losses generated in brazil for which the recording of a tax benefit was not permitted 
operating segment results summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in the following table net of inter segment transfers year ended december  vs in thousands revenues fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total revenues operating loss income fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services corporate office operating income loss segment operating margin fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands united states canada total north america emea latin america asia pacific total north american revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in  largely attributable to the increase in the us rig count  a increase in the canadian rig count  along with market share improvements in canada and several us regions 
internationally  revenues were up to million in  as compared to million in this increase includes million of revenues from our asia pacific region following the april acquisition described above and a million increase in brazil  primarily attributable to the continued ramp up of activity under our long term contract with petrobras 
emea revenues increased million  as a million increase in eastern europe and a million increase in algeria was largely offset by declines in other markets  including a million decline in tunisia attributable to a reduction in customer activity  and a million decline in libya due to the political and social unrest in that country 
operating income operating income for this segment was million reflecting an operating margin of in  compared to million and a operating margin in of this million improvement  our north american operating income increased million on a million increase in revenues  reflecting an incremental margin 
our international operations generated a million increase in operating income on a million increase in revenues  reflecting a incremental margin 
the low incremental margin is partially due to the acquisition of our asia pacific business unit in the second quarter of  which generated million of operating income in in addition  operating income of our international operations was negatively impacted in by a million provision for an allowance of a customer receivable in north africa 
mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and services mat sales total mat rental and services revenues increased million  including a million increase in the northeast us  a million increase in the gulf coast and million increase in the rocky mountain region 
the increase is primarily driven by higher demand for our durabase composite mats  which provide environmental protection and soil stability at the drilling sites 
mat sales also increased million  due to increasing demand for our durabase composite mat products from international e p customers and other industries 
operating income segment operating income increased by million on the million increase in revenues  reflecting an incremental margin of 
the high incremental margin  relative to recent historical experience  is primarily attributable to the significant increase in mat rental revenues 
incremental margins on mat rentals are stronger than mat sales or service activities  due to the fixed nature of operating expenses  including depreciation expense on our rental mat fleet 
environmental services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands e p waste norm and industrial waste total environmental services revenues were million in both and revenues in included million generated from disposals associated with the april deepwater horizon oil spill 
the loss of this revenue in was offset by market share gains and increased activity in oilfield waste disposals from state water and inland locations  along with a million increase in norm and industrial waste disposals 
operating income operating income for this segment decreased by million from to  primarily due to a million increase in transportation costs  due to a higher mix of inland waste disposals in  and a million non cash charge in for the abandonment of a disposal well 
corporate office corporate office expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase includes a million increase in employee compensation  primarily attributable to a million increase in employee incentives  along with million of transaction related expenses associated with the april acquisition described above 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during totaled million 
net income adjusted for non cash items provided million of cash during the period  while changes in operating assets and liabilities provided million of cash 
net cash used in investing activities during was million  which included million for the alliance acquisition described above 
capital expenditures were million in  consisting primarily of million in expenditures in our fluids systems and engineering segment  including million associated with the construction of a new technology center and million associated with purchases of equipment at our operating locations 
in addition  million was used in the mats and integrated services segment for expansion of the mat rental fleet and capacity expansion at our mat manufacturing facility 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million  including net borrowings under our lines of credit of million  largely offset by million in repurchases of our outstanding common stock and a payment associated with the one year earn out obligation of million following the april acquisition 
we anticipate that our working capital requirements for our operations will decline in the near term due to continued efforts to reduce accounts receivable and inventory from the levels at december  we expect total capital expenditures to range between million to million 
as of december   substantially all of our million of cash on hand resides within our foreign subsidiaries which we intend to leave permanently reinvested abroad 
we expect our subsidiary cash on hand  along with cash generated by operations and availability under our existing credit agreement to be adequate to fund our anticipated capital needs during the next months 
our capitalization was as follows as of december in thousands senior notes revolving credit facility other total stockholder equity total capitalization total debt to capitalization our financing arrangements include million of senior notes and a million revolving credit facility 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning april  holders may convert the senior notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the october  maturity date 
the conversion rate is initially shares of our common stock per  principal amount of senior notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
upon conversion  the senior notes will be settled in shares of our common stock 
we may not redeem the senior notes prior to their maturity date 
in november  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which provides for a million revolving loan facility available for borrowings and letters of credit and expires in november under the terms of the credit agreement  we can elect to borrow at an interest rate either based on libor plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio  ranging from to basis points  or at an interest rate based on the greatest of a prime rate  b the federal funds rate in effect plus basis points  or c the eurodollar rate for a eurodollar loan with a one month interest period plus basis points  in each case plus a margin ranging from to basis points 
the applicable margin on libor borrowings on december  was basis points 
in addition  we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit agreement of basis points 
the credit agreement contains customary financial and operating covenants  including a consolidated leverage ratio  a senior secured leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  at december   million was outstanding under the credit agreement  and million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the credit agreement leaving million of availability at december  additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding relating to foreign operations 
the credit agreement is a senior secured obligation  secured by first liens on all of our us tangible and intangible assets  including our accounts receivable and inventory 
additionally  a portion of the capital stock of our non us subsidiaries has also been pledged as collateral 
our foreign fluid systems and engineering subsidiaries in italy and brazil maintain local credit arrangements consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks  which are renewed on an annual basis 
we utilize local financing arrangements in our foreign operations in order to provide short term local liquidity needs  as well as to reduce the net investment in foreign operations subject to foreign currency risk 
advances under these short term credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of the subsidiary s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
the weighted average interest rate under these arrangements was and on total outstanding balances of million and million at december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with our insurance programs  we had established letters of credit in favor of certain insurance companies in the amount of million and million at december  and we also had million in guarantee obligations in connection with facility closure bonds and other performance bonds issued by insurance companies outstanding as of december  and other than normal operating leases for office and warehouse space  barges  rolling stock and other pieces of operating equipment  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or special purpose entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements 
contractual obligations a summary of our outstanding contractual and other obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in thousands thereafter total current maturities of long term debt long term debt including capital leases interest on senior notes foreign bank lines of credit operating leases trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities purchase commitments  not accrued other long term liabilities performance bond obligations letter of credit commitments total contractual obligations the above table does not reflect expected tax payments and uncertain tax positions due to the inability to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing and amount to be paid 
for additional discussion on uncertain tax positions  see note income taxes to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item in this report 
we anticipate that the obligations and commitments listed above that are due in less than one year will be paid from operating cash flows  available cash on hand  and availability under our existing credit agreement 
the specific timing of settlement for certain long term obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states us gaap  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts and disclosures reported 
significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include the following allowances for product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for self insured retentions under insurance programs  estimated performance and values associated with employee incentive programs  fair values used for goodwill impairment testing  undiscounted cash flows used for impairment testing of long lived assets and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies as well as government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in the financial condition of our customers or political changes in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
for  and  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for product returns we maintain reserves for estimated customer returns of unused materials in our fluids systems and engineering segment 
the reserves are established based upon historical customer return levels and estimated gross profit levels attributable to product sales 
future customer return levels may differ from the historical return rate 
impairments of long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of november  or more frequently  if an indication of impairment exists 
the impairment test includes a comparison of the carrying value of net assets of our reporting units  including goodwill  with their estimated fair values  which we determine using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
we identify our reporting units based on our analysis of several factors  including our operating segment structure  evaluation of the economic characteristics of our geographic regions within each of our operating segments  and the extent to which our business units share assets and other resources 
we determine the impairment of goodwill by comparing the carrying amounts of our reporting units with fair values  which we estimate using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
in completing our november  evaluation  we determined that each reporting unit s fair value was in excess of the net carrying value and therefore  no impairment was required 
we review property  plant and equipment  finite lived intangible assets and certain other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flows 
in estimating expected cash flows  we use a probability weighted approach 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
insurance we maintain reserves for estimated future payments associated with our self insured employee healthcare programs  as well as the self insured retention exposures under our general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
our reserves are determined based on historical cost experience under these programs  including estimated development of known claims under these programs and estimated incurred but not reported claims 
required reserves could change significantly based upon changes in insurance coverage  loss experience or inflationary impacts 
as of december  and  total insurance reserves were million and million  respectively 
income taxes we have total deferred tax assets of million at december  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
at december   a total valuation allowance of million was recorded  substantially all of which offsets million of net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes  as well as brazil 
changes in the expected future generation of qualifying taxable income within these jurisdictions or in the realizability of other tax assets may result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would be charged or credited to income in the period this determination was made 
specifically  we have a million valuation allowance recorded on the net operating loss carryforward in brazil which could be reversed in the future  depending on our ability to generate taxable income 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to previous guidance regarding testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the revised guidance permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
the update is effective for impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we do not expect the adoption of this additional guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued additional guidance regarding intangibles and goodwill impairment testing 
the objective of the additional guidance is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
under the new requirements  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  further quantitative testing is not required 
the changes in this update were effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this additional guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt outstanding of million  including million of borrowings under our senior notes  bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
variable rate debt totaled million which included million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million of borrowings under foreign bank lines of credit 
at the december  balance  a basis point increase in market interest rates during would cause our annual interest expense to increase approximately million resulting in a per diluted share reduction in annual net earnings 
foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in certain areas of emea  latin america  asia pacific  canada  uk and mexico 
we have foreign currency exchange risks associated with these operations  which are conducted principally in the foreign currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate which include european euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars and brazilian reais 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we enter into a transaction denominated in a currency other than our local currencies because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments 
unremitted foreign earnings permanently reinvested abroad upon which deferred income taxes have not been provided aggregated approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we have the ability and intent to leave these foreign earnings permanently reinvested abroad
