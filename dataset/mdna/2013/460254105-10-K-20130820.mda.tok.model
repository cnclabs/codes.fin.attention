table of contents the building of an efficient and flexible manufacturing and supply chain 
our manufacturing strategy is to build our products using a mix of internal factories and external contract manufacturers  whether for wafer fabrication or assembly 
in particular  we prefer to use our internal factories primarily to manufacture new products and products where we utilize proprietary technologies  and external foundries and contract manufacturers to supplement our internal capacity  as well as respond to changes in demand for wafer fabrication and back end assembly 
during fiscal year  in order to provide us additional flexibility to adjust our internal manufacturing footprint to changes in demand  we added additional capacity to our existing contract wafer fabrication and assembly capacity related to certain proprietary  and higher value added products and programs 
in the past  we have targeted external contractors for up to percent of our wafer fabrication needs  and percent of our packaging needs 
while we have achieved these goals in the past  these external contractor percentages fluctuate quarter to quarter based upon management s decision to adjust the mix of internal and external manufacturing in light of changes in actual and or anticipated demand  the availability of internal and external capacity  and the lead times required to increase capacity 
going forward  we plan to target our use of external contractors for up to percent of our wafer fabrication needs and percent of our packaging needs 
as our reliance upon external foundries and contract manufacturers increases  we are exposed to a higher degree of manufacturing and supply chain risk see part i  item a  risk factors

table of contents manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing involves two primary phases of production wafer fabrication and assembly 
wafer fabrication requires a sequence of process steps that expose silicon wafers to chemicals that change their electrical properties 
the chemicals are applied in patterns that define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices  termed die or chips on each wafer 
assembly is the sequence of production steps that divide the wafer into individual chips and enclose the chips in structures  termed packages which make them usable in a circuit 
power semiconductors generally use process technology and equipment already proven in the manufacturing of ics

for financial information about geographic areas  please see part ii  item  note  segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 
competitors we believe that our comprehensive line of power management products and our ability to combine our silicon products into compact  cost effective packages and system level solutions differentiates us from our competition 
our products compete with products manufactured by others  in varying degrees  on the basis of enabling capability  performance  reliability  quality  price  and service including technical advice and support 
generally  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive  and subject to rapid price fluctuations  cyclical demand and product design changes 
we face significant competition in each of our product lines from well established us and international semiconductor companies 
several of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources with which to pursue design  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
our major competitors by segment for the fiscal year ended june  were as follows segment competitors alphabetical power management devices fairchild  infineon  on semiconductor  renesas  stmicroelectronics  toshiba  and vishay energy saving products fairchild  infineon  ixys  mitsubishi  nxp  on semiconductor  renesas  stmicroelectronics  and toshiba automotive products fairchild  infineon  nxp  stmicroelectronics  and vishay enterprise power fairchild  infineon  intersil  texas instruments  and volterra hirel aeroflex and microsemi 
table of contents research and development our r d program focuses on the advancement and diversification of our technology platforms and products  as well as next generation technologies 
for fiscal year we spent million percent of revenues on r d activities 
we expect to maintain our r d spend levels in new product development over the next fiscal year in order to meet our longer term revenue goals 
technology platforms supported include our power management ic platforms  our mosfet and igbt switch platforms  as well as packaging multichip module platforms such as powirstage  supirbuck and iram ps multi chip modules 
our r d effort also focuses on developing longer term  broadly applicable new technologies such as ganpowir tm  our proprietary gan on si based power conversion device platform 
based on all these platforms  we have been developing and introducing power management products and new architectures for the next generation of applications  including new game stations  high performance servers  hybrid vehicles and energy efficient appliances 
we maintain and operate a global network of product design centers 
during fiscal year  we continued to introduce advanced power management solutions that drive high performance computing and save energy across our served market segments 
these products included a integrated power stage devices  b ics and chipsets improving power density and efficiency in dc dc applications found in high performance computers and servers  c the continued expansion of our chil digital controllers and directfet product families  d ics for class d audio  electronic lighting ballasts and motor control  e ganpowir tm devices for use in class d audio amplification  f our smartrectifier ics helping computer and consumer entertainment devices meet emerging system and standby power regulations  g radiation hardened dc dc converter modules for space satellite power applications  and h expansion of our igbt and mosfet switch product families 
we also continue to commit substantial resources to r d to generate new patents and other intellectual property related to our technologies and products 
backlog our sales are generally made on a purchase order basis  with lead times varying depending on market conditions and internal capacity factors 
customers are generally not subject to long term contracts 
however  we have from time to time entered into long term supply agreements with certain customers 
these long term supply agreements generally do not contain minimum purchase commitments  and products to be delivered and the related delivery schedules under these long term contracts could be frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs 
because of these factors  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period and we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues 
seasonality our revenues are affected by the cyclical nature of the business of the end users of our products and the trends in our customers end markets 
as a result  our results typically vary within a given customer segment across a fiscal year as conditions in end user markets change and also in response to macro economic and industry long term trends and business cycles 

table of contents intellectual property we continue to make significant investments in developing  making use of and protecting our intellectual property ip 
in the past fiscal year  we added approximately patents worldwide to our patent portfolio 
we have approximately issued unexpired us patents and approximately patent applications pending worldwide 
we are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others 
we have several registered trademarks in the united states and abroad  including the trademarks hexfet and directfet 
we believe that our ip contributes to our competitive advantage  and we are committed to enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights  including through litigation if and when necessary 
we report revenues from the sale and or licensing of our technologies and manufacturing process know how  as well as settlements of claims brought against third parties in our ip segment 
in the fiscal years  and  we received million  million and million of royalty revenues  respectively 
ip segment revenues are dependent on our licensed mosfet  hvic and package technology patents  the continued enforceability and validity of those patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our technology or develop competing technologies  and general market conditions 
the continuation of such revenues is subject to a number of risks see part i  item a  risk factors our ongoing protection and reliance on our ip assets expose us to risks 
we continue to derive royalty revenues from hvic and package technology patents  and from time to time  we enter into opportunistic licensing arrangements that we believe are consistent with our business strategy 
aside from our hvic and package technologies  our ip strategy has been to use our ip primarily for the design and development of a value added family of products  and to defend those products in the marketplace 
from time to time  we also engage in opportunistic licensing 
in our ip segment  we continue to evaluate licensing of technologies or fields of use that have application beyond our product groups or which no longer align with our long term business strategies for our product groups 
we also target certain technologies for licensing that we believe help establish our product platforms and structures as industry standards and thereby enhance the growth of our products in various end market applications 
environmental matters federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the storage  use and discharge of certain materials  chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor manufacturing processes  and on the operation of our facilities and equipment 
we believe we use reasonable efforts to maintain a system of compliance and controls for these laws and regulations 
despite our efforts and controls  from time to time  issues may arise with respect to these matters 
additionally  under some of these laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if properties are contaminated or if waste is sent to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated 
we may also be subject to common law claims if released substances damage or harm third parties 
we cannot make assurances that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment and the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as could any failure by or violation of us to comply with any prior  current or future environmental laws and regulations 
our disclosures regarding the matters set forth in note  environmental matters  to our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii  item  herein  are incorporated herein by reference

the market value of our business may decline during the down portion of cycles or rapid adverse changes in demand 
we can also experience sharp declines in end market demand  leading to under utilization of our manufacturing capacity and declining revenues and gross margins 
in addition  in those circumstances  we have previously recorded significant charges to recognize impairment in the value of some of our manufacturing equipment  the costs to reduce the size of our workforce and exit facilities  and other restructuring costs  and could do so again in the future 
some of our business segments also experience annual seasonality with wide fluctuations of supply and demand  which may result in significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenues and gross margins in those segments 
changes in the mix of customer demand can adversely affect our operating results and require additional investments in production capacity 
we try to anticipate customer demand and plan our investments in manufacturing capacity and production to match anticipated demand 
also  some of our products can be sold at relatively higher gross margins than others 
as a result  if the mix of customer demand changes to a mix other than what we anticipated or changes to a mix of products with relatively lower gross margins  we may experience a reduction in our revenues and gross margins 
additionally  a mismatch between our inventories and customer demand  could result in our having inventories of products that may not be sellable and not enough product of the proper mix to meet demand 
these factors may result in the need to write off unsellable inventories and or miss revenue sale opportunities 
if the mix of customer demand requires us to increase our production capacity for particular products  we could incur additional costs associated with the introduction of new products and start up of new facilities and production lines 
as a result of these effects  adverse changes in the mix of customer demand could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if the demand for our products or a particular mix of our products increases faster than we anticipate or are able to produce  we may not be able to satisfy the demand with our planned available capacity  which could limit our revenue growth potential and expose us to loss of design and sale opportunities  and potential liability 
during rapid demand or product mix changes  product manufacturing lead times may increase and we may have challenges being able to meet the demand  especially for particular product lines 
we attempt to procure internal or external capacity to meet our demand forecast and our customer demands for particular products 
however  since additional capacity can take up to six months or more to obtain and install  if the demand for our products or a particular mix of our products increases at a rate faster than we anticipate or are able to produce  we may not be able to increase our internal and external manufacturing capacity fast enough to satisfy the higher demand 
as a result  our revenue growth may be limited by internal or external manufacturing capacity available to us 
to the extent we are not able to satisfy customer demands timely or otherwise  we may also lose design and sales opportunities which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
to the extent we are not able to satisfy our contractual obligations to fulfill products  we may be subject to potential claims 
while we would defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims  large claims  if found meritorious  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and increased competition could result in lower prices for our products and adversely impact our future profitability 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive 
price pressures often exist as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices or by offering a more desirable technological solution 
product alternatives from competitors can also reduce our ability to win customer designs and reduce sales generally 
to the extent our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have  they may be able to compete on a stronger basis than us 
pricing and other competitive pressures can adversely affect our revenues and gross margin  and hence  our profitability 

table of contents new technologies could result in the development of new more competitive products and a decrease in demand for our existing products  and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand 
rapidly changing technologies  design cycles  new product introductions and changing industry standards  characterize the semiconductor industry 
therefore  our financial performance depends on our ability to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market  sell and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
as a result  we must spend substantial resources on r d and manufacturing capability for new products and technology platforms  including our gallium nitride technologies 
if we do not develop new technologies or timely react to changes in existing technologies we could have lower revenues and a loss of market share relative to our competitors 
we do not know if we will successfully identify and capitalize on new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner including our gallium nitride technologies  or that products or disruptive technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive in the future 
in addition  to remain competitive  we must continue to reduce wafer costs  decrease die sizes and improve manufacturing yields across our product lines 
we do not know if we can accomplish these goals 
in addition  if there is a fundamental shift in technologies or if we do not capitalize on our new gallium nitride technology before others  our competitive position within the industry would be materially and adversely affected 
delays in production at our new manufacturing facilities or at third party manufacturers  implementing new production processes or resolving problems associated with production or malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing capacity and efficiencies 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities  defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower product yields and increase costs 
our manufacturing capacity and efficiency are important factors in our profitability 
we cannot promise that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or enough to be able to meet demand 
our strategy for increased  efficient and flexible  capacity has also included the greater use of third party manufacturers for wafer and product assembly 
we are also constructing a new facility in singapore 
we have at times experienced difficulty completing construction at new facilities  in beginning production at new facilities or third party manufacturers  or in changing processes for existing products or moving and qualifying product lines to new locations 
we have also from time to time experienced delays in our ability to increase capacities  delays in product deliveries and reduced yields 
additionally  from time to time  there are market constraints on our ability to obtain necessary production equipment from third party equipment manufacturers 
as a consequence  our plans to adjust our manufacturing and achieve the needed capacity efficiency and flexibility  including our ability to hire staff and make our new facility in singapore operational in a timely and cost effective way  could be delayed or not achieved at all 
we also may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields  experience product delivery delays  and or quality issues in the future  as a result of  and among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  delays in upgrading or expanding existing facilities  changing our process technologies or qualifying third party manufacturers to produce our products 
as a result of any of these factors  we could have a loss of revenues or an inability to meet customer demands 
also  our operating results have in the past been  and in the future would be adversely affected by low utilization of our production capacity  if due to these factors our facilities are not operating at an efficient level 
our ongoing protection and reliance on intellectual property assets expose us to risks 
we have traditionally relied on our patented and other proprietary technologies for protection of the products we sell and for licensing revenues 
enforcement of our rights is costly  risky and time consuming 
we cannot provide assurance that we can successfully continue to protect our intellectual property rights  especially in foreign markets 
we have limited recurring revenue from licensing agreements for existing patents and proprietary technologies  however  we may enter into opportunistic licensing arrangements that we believe are consistent with our business strategy 
what royalty income we obtain is largely dependent on the following factors the level of product sales and mix of products sold by licensees  the introduction and sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by our patents and proprietary technologies  the defensibility and enforceability of our patents and proprietary technologies  changes in our licensees unit sales  prices or die sizes  the terms  if any  upon which expiring license agreements are renegotiated  and our ability to obtain revenues from new licensing opportunities 

table of contents we cannot promise that we will obtain new licenses to produce royalties or that we will continue to receive royalties from existing licenses in the future 
while we try to predict the effects of these factors  often there are variations or factors that can significantly affect results to be different from that predicted 
accordingly  we cannot promise that our predictions of our ip segment revenues will be consistent with actual results  nor can we guarantee the level of our future royalty income 
our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain technologies expose us to risks and could negatively affect our financial results 
our future success and competitive position may depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our products 
our ability to maintain these technologies is achieved in part by defending and maintaining the validity of our patents  defending claims of infringement brought by our competitors and other third parties  and at times by asserting intellectual property claims against third parties 
we have asserted intellectual property against others and we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we also license certain patents and other technologies owned by others for use in our products and processes 
our involvement in existing and future intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts and attention of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor 
if it is claimed or determined that we have infringed the rights of third parties  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent or other technology owners  discontinue  change our processes or products  or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
for intellectual property licenses we have  our ability to continue to use such technologies depends on our ability to maintain such licenses 
we cannot promise that we would be successful in such efforts or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms or that we would be successful in our claims against third parties 
all of these factors and our failure to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  to obtain licenses on acceptable terms  the occurrence of litigation itself or our failure to be successful in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if some oems do not design our products into their equipment or if we do not convert design or program wins to actual sales  for whatever reasons  a portion of our revenues may be adversely affected 
a design win or program award from a customer does not guarantee that the design or program win will result in future sales to that customer 
we also are unable to promise that we will be able to convert any design or program wins into sales for the life of any particular program  or at all  or that the revenues from such wins would be significant 
we also cannot promise that we will achieve any level of design or program wins 
without design or program wins from oems  we would only be able to sell our products to these oems as a second source  if at all 
once an oem designs another supplier s product into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design or program wins with that oem s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk 
achieving a design or program win with a customer also does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer 
accordingly  if oems do not design our products into their equipment or if we do not convert design or program wins to actual sales  for whatever reasons  our revenues may be materially adversely affected 
third party interruptions  delays or material cost increases affecting our materials  parts or equipment may impair our competitive position and our operations 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment  including among other things  silicon  mold compounds  lead frames  fabrication and assembly equipment  on a timely basis from third parties 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment in a timely manner from our third party suppliers or if the costs of materials  parts or equipment increase significantly 
from time to time  suppliers may discontinue products  extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints  market conditions or other factors 
for example  from time to time we experience material cost increases for commodity metals that are included in materials used in our manufacturing processes  and the future costs of these materials remains uncertain 
additionally  we have a limited number of suppliers or sole suppliers for some materials  parts and equipment  and any interruption could materially impair our operations  our revenues  and adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand  and otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents interruptions  delays or cost increases at our key facilities may impair our competitive position and our operations 
we manufacture a substantial portion of the semiconductor wafers for our products at our temecula  california and newport  wales facilities and use third party manufacturers to produce the remaining portion of the semiconductor wafers used by us 
also  we assemble and test products at our tijuana  mexico facility and use third party contract manufacturers to assemble and test a larger portion of our products 
any disruption of operations at the facilities where we manufacture products or where our products are manufactured  whether as a result of equipment malfunction or maintenance needs  natural or man made disasters  or other effects could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues  meet customer demand and otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products may be found to be defective and  as a result  claims may be asserted by others  which may harm our business and our reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our results and financial condition 
our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated 
although we maintain quality control systems  we ship large quantities of products to a wide range of customers around the world  for use in a variety of high profile and often critical applications 
those applications include  among others  space  aviation  automotive and medical applications 
in the ordinary course of our business  we receive claims that some of these products are defective or do not perform to published or agreed specifications 
we could also receive claims that our products have caused personal injury or property damage 
since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them and potential claims for consequential damages  or for injury or property damage  depending on applicable law and contract  we often need to defend against claims for damages that are larger than the revenues and profit we receive from the products involved 
in addition  our ability to reduce the amount of these claims may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business 
even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for claims  we may choose to pay them to retain a customer business or goodwill or to avoid the costs and attendant risks of protracted litigation 
our results of operations and business would be adversely affected as a result of significant alleged quality or performance issues in our products  or if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result 
although we currently have product liability and other types of insurance  we have certain deductibles and exclusions to such policies and may not have sufficient insurance coverage 
we also may not have sufficient resources to satisfy all possible product liability or other types of product claims 
in addition  in our hirel segment  we are sometimes subject to government procurement regulations and other laws that could result in costly investigations and other legal proceedings as a consequence of allegedly defective products or other actions 
any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products  loss of customers and harm to our business and reputation 
our reliance on third party contractors to make semiconductor wafers and to assemble certain of our parts as a lower cost alternative may expose us to business risks 
a significant portion of our semiconductor wafers are fabricated by third party contractors and are assembled and tested by third party contractors 
we have used these contractors as a lower cost alternative to in house manufacturing  and to increase our capacity efficiency and manufacturing flexibility 
we review these contractors references  and historical manufacturing experience prior to the engagement of their services  and require oversight over their quality assurance processes 
however  if we fail to adequately review the contractors historical or current manufacturing processes  or if the contractors do not perform as needed  the quality of our products could be subject to higher failure rates  which could adversely impact our reputation and the growth of future business with our customers 
although we believe that parties to our third party manufacturing arrangements would have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  there can be no assurance that these parties or any future parties will perform their obligations as expected 
from time to time and in the ordinary course of business we have commercial or product quality disputes with such contractors  and there can be no assurance that other future disputes will not arise 
in some instances  we do not have long term agreements with our contractors 
as a result  we do not have immediate control over our product delivery schedules or product quality 
due to the amount of time often required to qualify contractors and the high cost of qualifying multiple parties for the same products  we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we are forced to find alternative third parties to perform contract services 
any delivery delays from contractors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  and affect our ability to satisfy customer obligations 
also  the failure of these contractors to properly perform their obligations could cause us not to achieve our goals of achieving greater capacity efficiency and flexibility 

table of contents we maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation  reduction or delay in delivery schedules  which may result in lower than expected revenues and gross margin 
with certain exceptions related primarily to products within our hirel segment  we manufacture primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than under fixed supply obligations 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand generally or in the mix of that demand 
therefore  many of our purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products  and a specific mix of products  often without significant advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to build them could have a material adverse effect on our inventory levels and value  our revenues and our operating results generally 
additionally  cancellation or significant reduction in significant customer programs  could materially affect our ability to achieve our revenues and gross margin targets 
we build and maintain inventory in order to meet our historic and projected needs  but cannot assure that our inventory will be adequate to meet demand  our commitments to customers or be salable at a future date 
we build and maintain inventory in order to meet our historic and projected needs  but cannot assure that we will accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary materials  and build the proper mix and amount of inventory 
if we fail to adequately predict demand and align inventory to that demand  we may not be able to meet our customer commitments for deliveries of product  and our revenues and gross margin may be adversely affected 
to the extent we have made contractual commitments to customers  and do not satisfy those commitments  we may be exposed to claims for damages 
from time to time  we have unusually high inventory levels on hand relative to current sales 
in these circumstances when we produce or have produced inventory that does not meet current or future demand  or customers revise forecasts or cancel orders  we may determine that certain of the inventory may only be sold at a discount or may not be sold at all  potentially resulting in the reduction in the carrying value of our inventory and a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our distributors may return inventory which could negatively impact our financial results 
many of our distributors have some rights to return inventory under stock rotation programs and also may return inventory with our approval or under certain circumstances 
in addition  we have  from time to time  accepted  and may in the future accept  additional returns 
if these distributors return a large amount of inventory  our operating results could be impacted by lower revenues and higher costs associated with inventory write offs 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has come from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
loss or financial failure of any significant customer or distributor  reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or distributors  or cancellation of a significant order  could materially and adversely affect our business and or that of one or more of our reportable segments 
we may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel  and key executive officers required to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel  as well as key executive officers 
personnel with the necessary semiconductor expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
while we try to ensure continuity of management in crucial areas we cannot guaranty that these efforts will be successful in all circumstances 
similarly  there is no assurance that we will be able to retain any of our existing key personnel  or attract  assimilate and retain the additional personnel needed to support our business 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we are subject to a revolving credit facility that may restrict our current and future operations  and the company may not be able to use the facility when it is in adverse financial circumstances 
in october  we entered into a four year senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in october  and under which we may borrow up to million 
whether or not we have borrowings under the facility  the revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our business  including restrictions on additional indebtedness  liens and encumbrances  investments  acquisitions  loans and advances  mergers  consolidations and asset dispositions  dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  capital expenditures and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the terms of the credit facility also require us to comply with certain financial tests 
we cannot assure that we will be able to satisfy the financial tests set forth under the revolving credit facility to be able to make or maintain borrowings under the facility 
in particular  the facility requires that the company maintain a certain liquidity level for borrowings  and that liquidity level is not likely to be maintained during times when the company is in an adverse financial condition 
also  whether or not we make borrowings under the facility  restrictions under the facility may limit our ability to engage in activities or transactions that could otherwise benefit us 
if we cannot satisfy the restrictions and financial tests under the revolving credit facility  then we may either have to terminate the facility and repay any indebtedness thereunder or be subject to an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner may be adversely impacted resulting in a material weakness or a material misstatement and considerable additional expense  negatively impact investor confidence and adversely impact the price of our common stock 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  we are required to conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in certain prior years  we had previously determined that we had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
while these material weaknesses have been remediated  there is no assurance that we would not have additional material weaknesses in the future 
each material weakness results from a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
in addition  it is possible that in the future  as a result of our assessment of our internal control that we may identify material weaknesses and be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of investor confidence in our internal controls 
the failure to remediate any such potential material weaknesses in a timely manner could possibly cause us to fail to complete our periodic filing requirements and obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements 
we have previously been named as a defendant in lawsuits and may in the future be named as defendant in other lawsuits that may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have previously been named as a defendant in several securities class action  derivative and other lawsuits  and had been subject to investigations by governmental agencies 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to additional lawsuits and other legal proceedings in the future 
for any lawsuits and proceedings  our attention may be diverted from our ordinary business operations and we may incur significant expenses associated with defense and potential obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors who may be parties to or involved in such action or proceeding 
depending on the outcome of such future lawsuits and proceedings  we may also be required to pay material damages and fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct  or suffer other penalties  remedies or sanctions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  and  consequently  negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed and the inter company pricing related to those profits  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  changes in available tax credits  changes in share based compensation expense  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including transfer pricing guidelines  and foreign tax holdings and our ability to satisfy the conditions of foreign tax holidays  changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  or the repatriation of non us earnings against which we have not previously provided us taxes 
in addition  we have made certain judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in accordance with gaap the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on our assessment whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets  after considering all available positive and negative evidence 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future given unforeseen changes in market conditions  tax laws or other factors  valuation allowances may be recorded or increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to reduce income tax expense  or credit additional paid in capital or other comprehensive income  as applicable 
certain of our businesses are subject to governmental regulation and procurement processes that expose us to additional risks  including us export control laws 
certain of our businesses  in particular our hirel segment  manufacture and sell many products that are subject to us export control laws and related regulations 
we also manufacture and sell products that are sold indirectly to the us government and may subject us to government procurement regulations  investigations or review 
while we maintain a system of controls over such products designed to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations  we cannot promise that these controls will be effective in all cases 
there are also limitations on the effectiveness of controls  including the failure of human judgment 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of controls or are otherwise found non compliant with applicable laws and regulations  violations could lead to governmental investigations  fines  penalties and limitations on our ability to export product from the us  all of which could have a material effect on our financial result 
also  if these laws or regulations affecting exports change  they could adversely affect our ability to design  manufacture and sell many of our products of our hirel segment outside the us  and could thereby materially adversely affect our business as a whole 
us governmental procurement regulations require that our hirel segment from time to time provide to its customers certain information that is more readily provided by companies that maintain a cost accounting system meeting certain us governmental standards 
we do not have such a system  nor is one required for the business we conduct  however  our inability to efficiently provide cost information in the form that may be required by certain customers to satisfy us government regulations may limit our ability to secure certain us government related business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and gross margin 
quality control and similar standards are applicable to our facilities and the facilities of our contractors in which certain products are manufactured  and these standards are subject to compliance review by certain us government agencies 
our use of third party facilities meeting such standards is subject to negotiation of satisfactory agreements with those parties and if we cannot reach such agreements  certain of our businesses  may experience production constraints and its revenues may be materially reduced 
to the extent governmental regulation  or changes  or procurement decision making are not favorable to us  the results of certain of our businesses may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 
section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act  requires the sec to promulgate new disclosure requirements for manufacturers of products containing certain minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
these conflict minerals are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors 
manufacturers are also required to disclose their efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from them 
the new disclosure rules will take effect in may the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the metals used in the manufacture of our products 
the regulations may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals  and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
finally  some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that the metals used in our products are free of conflict minerals 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future 
our common stock  which is traded on the nyse  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results and earnings  financial performance and other activities of other publicly traded companies in the semiconductor industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
any similar fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we cannot promise that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
semiconductor manufacturing requires a regular upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment  especially for new technologies we develop  including our gallium nitride technologies 
we are also attempting to add the appropriate level and mix of capacity to meet our customers future demand  as well as the establishment of our new facility in singapore 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment  or that we will be able to complete and operate our new facility in singapore in time and at the levels required to satisfy customer demand 
although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  existing cash reserves and other equity or debt financings that we may obtain will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure requirements  we cannot promise that this will be the case or that alternative sources of capital or credit will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
we have made and may continue to make substantial investments in plant and equipment that may become impaired 
in order to conduct our business  we make substantial investments in plant and equipment  including substantial investments in support of the construction of a new facility in singapore and in equipment loaned to our third party contract manufacturers 
some of our investments in plant and equipment support particular technologies  processes or products  and may not be applicable to other or newer technologies  processes or products 
also  the ability to relocate and qualify equipment for our operations  whether within our company or to and from third party contractors is typically time consuming and costly 
to the extent we invest in more equipment or a mix of equipment than we can use efficiently  experience low plant or equipment utilization due to reduced demand or adverse market conditions  our plant or equipment becomes older or outmoded  or we are not able to efficiently recover and or utilize equipment on loan at third party contractors  we may incur significant costs or impairment charges that could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

table of contents our restructuring programs may not achieve their goals  could be costly  delayed and disruptive to our business  and could materially adversely affect our results and financial condition 
in august  we announced a restructuring program to modify our manufacturing strategy due to a reduction in customer demand 
the plan included closing or resizing various manufacturing facilities and otherwise reducing our selling and administrative and research and development costs 
while many of the actions associated with this program have already taken place  others have yet to be concluded 
we cannot assure that these restructuring initiatives will achieve their goals or accomplish the cost reductions planned 
additionally  because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the cost reductions could adversely affect productivity and revenues to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these restructuring activities  and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseen factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 
costs associated with the program and the timing of the program are subject to a number of conditions  among them the ability to qualify existing product lines at other internal or external manufacturing facilities including a new facility we are constructing in singapore  customer requirements or demand  changes in business conditions and or operational needs  retention of key employees  and governmental regulations 
accordingly  there could be both adverse changes in the amount of costs or the timing of the anticipated actions 
changes in the timing or amount of costs associated with  or disruptions caused by  our restructuring initiatives could materially adversely affect our results and financial condition 
while we attempt to monitor the credit worthiness of our customers  we may be at risk due to the adverse financial condition of one or more customers 
we have established procedures for the review and monitoring of the credit worthiness of our customers and or significant amounts owing from customers 
despite our monitoring and procedures  especially in the current macroeconomic situation  we may find that  despite our efforts  one or more of our customers become insolvent or face bankruptcy proceedings 
such events could have an adverse effect on our operating results if our receivables applicable to that customer become uncollectable in whole or in part  or if our customers financial situation result in reductions in whole or in part of our ability to continue to sell our products or services to such customers at the same levels or at all 
large potential environmental liabilities or costs of related regulatory compliance may adversely impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
federal  state  foreign and local laws and regulations impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials  chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor manufacturing processes  and on the operation of our facilities and equipment 
we believe we use reasonable efforts to maintain a system of compliance and controls for these laws and regulations 
however  we cannot promise that these controls will be effective or that issues with respect to these matters will not occur 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls  including the failure of human judgment 
under some laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
under other laws  we may be subject to fines and penalties if facilities or equipment are not operated in technical compliance with permit conditions or if required reports are not timely filed with applicable agencies 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
we have been subject to claims of governmental authorities and other third parties  and may continue to be in the future see note  environmental matters  to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii  item 
further  changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future 
additionally  if we were to divest additional facilities  our facilities may undergo further environmental review and investigation which may lead to previously unknown environmental liabilities 
while we intend to defend against any claim of liability in this area vigorously  any claim against us in this regard if resolved unfavorably  or any present or future failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations  could subject us to serious liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

table of contents our international operations expose us to material risks 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
we maintain or contract with others to promote significant operations and equipment in foreign countries  including wafer fabrication  product assembly and testing 
among others  these risks include changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including tax laws in the united states and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  transportation delays  work stoppages  economic and political instability  crime  kidnapping  war  terrorism  and foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  in certain jurisdictions where we use third party contractors  the legal systems do not provide effective remedies to us when the contractor has breached its obligation or otherwise fails to perform 
in addition  it is more difficult in some foreign countries to protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as is possible in the united states 
therefore  the risk of piracy or misuse of our technology and product may be greater in these foreign countries 
as a result of our foreign operations  we have sales  expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
for example some of our manufacturing costs are denominated in british pound  mexican peso and other foreign currencies  and some sales of our products are denominated in euro  japanese yen and other foreign currencies  and some property  plant and equipment purchases are denominated in japanese yen  euro  british pound and other foreign currencies 
as a result  movements in exchange rates could cause our net sales and expenses to fluctuate  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
these activities may not be successful in reducing our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
our reported results can be affected adversely and unexpectedly by the implementation of new  or changes in the interpretation of existing  united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our financial reporting is subject to gaap  and gaap is subject to change over time 
if new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting  our reported results of operations and financial condition could be affected substantially  including requirements to restate historical financial reporting 
security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the integrity of our information and expose us to liability  which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 
we routinely collect and store sensitive data  including intellectual property and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers  suppliers and business partners 
the secure processing  maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy 
despite our security measures  our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error  malfeasance or other disruptions 
any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed  publicly disclosed  lost or stolen 
any such access  disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information 
it could also result in regulatory penalties  disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers  damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services  which could adversely affect our business operating margins  revenues and competitive position 

table of contents terrorist attacks  or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
these activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results 
natural disasters  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
our corporate headquarters  one of our manufacturing facilities  one of our key research facilities  one of our key third party foundries and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines 
in addition  one of our major manufacturing facilities is located in a high brush fire danger area 
another major manufacturing facility and the facilities of some of our third party contractors are potentially susceptible to flood risk 
additionally  many of our other third party contractors perform work for us in areas susceptible to natural disasters 
natural disasters  whether in the united states or internationally  generally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate  our ability to achieve revenues and our profitability 
in the past  our operations and those of our third party contractors have been affected by a number of natural disasters  including  among other things  earthquakes  fires  floods  volcanoes  hurricanes  and inclement weather  and may be affected by additional natural disasters in the future 
additionally  such events could result in power or other utility outages  delay or result in cancellation of domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains  close factories and delay production  reduce sales and cancel orders  and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
such events could affect physical facilities  including without limitation  the facilities where we or our contractors or vendors produce materials and products whether finished goods or raw materials and process chemicals and gases 
such events could also make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult  delay delivery  or cost prohibitive 
additionally  to the extent we may not be able to satisfy contractual obligations  we may be subject to potential claims 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that natural events could have on our company  we cannot provide an estimate of how these activities might adversely affect our future results however  we could be materially and adversely affected by any of these events 
also  although we maintain insurance policies  we may not have or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at levels and with such deductibles and limitations that would prevent a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

we believe our current facilities  supplemented by third party contract wafer fabrication and assembly capacity  are adequate for our near term operating needs  however  we continue to take a number of actions to respond to changes in customer demand 
specifically  during fiscal year we added capacity to our existing external contract wafer fabrication capacity and assembly capacity related to certain proprietary and higher value added products and programs 
going forward we plan to further expand use of our external wafer fabrication contractors and assembly contractors 
recently  we have made capacity adjustments to our internal factories 
pursuant to our fiscal year restructuring initiative  we have closed one older and less efficient factory  and will partially close another 
we are consolidating a certain amount of our proprietary processes such as ultra thin wafer processing into a small facility in singapore 
once operational  certain wafers from both third party contract wafer fabrication facilities and internal manufacturing facilities will go to our singapore facility for final processing
