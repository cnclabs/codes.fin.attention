item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we are a biopharmaceutical company developing first in class therapies for cancer 
imetelstat  a novel  first in class telomerase inhibitor  is our product candidate in clinical development 
imetelstat is based on our core expertise in telomerase and telomere biology 
telomerase is an enzyme that enables cancer cells to maintain telomere length  which provides them with the capacity for limitless cellular replication 
imetelstat is a potent and specific inhibitor of telomerase 
based on clinical data we obtained in late  we may develop imetelstat to treat one or more hematologic myeloid malignancies such as myelofibrosis  or mf  myelodysplastic syndromes  or acute myelogenous leukemia 
we are also evaluating the impact of a recent updated analysis that included a more mature follow up of clinical data and a re test of patient tumor samples using a refined  prospective assay to measure telomere length from our randomized phase trial of imetelstat in advanced non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  on our plans for the potential development of imetelstat to treat one or more solid tumors  such as nsclc 
we have incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  or per share  million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been research support payments under collaboration agreements and milestones  royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements 
revenues generated from these arrangements will not be sufficient alone to continue or expand our research or development activities and otherwise sustain our operations 
as of december   we had cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million at december  and million at december  we estimate that our existing capital resources  amounts available to us under our equipment financing facility and future interest income will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least the next months 
phase top line results hematologic malignancies we evaluated imetelstat in two single arm phase trials in hematologic  or blood based  cancers essential thrombocythemia  or et  and multiple myeloma 
top line data from the et trial that we 
table of contents presented in december at the american society of hematology annual meeting showed durable hematologic and molecular responses in patients  suggesting that imetelstat inhibited the progenitor cells of the malignant clone believed to be responsible for the underlying disease in a relatively selective manner 
in addition  preliminary data from the multiple myeloma trial showed a rapid and significant decrease in myeloma progenitor cells that were detected in blood over the course of imetelstat treatment 
the phase trials of imetelstat in et and multiple myeloma are no longer enrolling patients and we are continuing to follow patients previously enrolled in the trials 
we believe the clinical results in et provide the rationale to pursue development of imetelstat in other hematologic myeloid malignancies  most of which are driven by clonal proliferation of malignant progenitor cells 
phase top line results solid tumors we also evaluated imetelstat in two randomized  controlled phase clinical trials in solid tumors one evaluated imetelstat in combination with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic breast cancer  or mbc  and the other tested imetelstat as maintenance treatment compared to observation following induction treatment with platinum based doublet chemotherapy in patients with advanced nsclc 
in september  we discontinued the mbc trial because the median progression free survival  or pfs  in the imetelstat treatment arm was shorter than in the comparator arm 
in the nsclc trial  a modest  although not statistically significant  trend in pfs in favor of the imetelstat treatment arm was observed 
enrollment in the phase nsclc trial was completed in may  and we are continuing to follow patients previously enrolled in the trial 
in december  we completed a sub group analysis of the clinical data from the nsclc trial in which we analyzed the effect of imetelstat on tumors with various tumor telomere lengths 
the data from this sub group analysis showed that the imetelstat treated patients with short tumor telomere length experienced an increase in pfs compared to patients in the comparator arm 
this treatment effect was not observed in patients whose tumors had medium to long telomeres 
in march  we completed an updated analysis of the sub group based on tumor telomere length that included a more mature follow up of clinical data and a re test of patient tumor samples using a refined  prospective assay to measure telomere length 
in the updated analysis  the magnitude of the treatment effect in patients whose tumors had short telomeres was not reproduced 
data from the nsclc trial have been accepted for presentation at the american association for cancer research annual meeting to be held in april future development of imetelstat based on the data from our phase et clinical trial  in november  dr 
ayalew tefferi at the mayo clinic initiated an investigator sponsored trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of imetelstat in patients with mf and determine the optimal dose and schedule for further evaluation 
data from this trial will inform any future geron sponsored clinical trial in patients with mf 
in addition  we intend to expand our directed program of investigator sponsored trials to other hematologic myeloid malignancies  including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukemia 
we are also working with expert advisors to assess the potential for further development of imetelstat in et 
we are evaluating the impact of the march updated sub group analysis on our plans for potential development of imetelstat in solid tumors  including nsclc 
in addition  in order to explore the hypothesis that patients with nsclc whose tumors have short telomeres may have an improved outcome when treated with imetelstat  we are refining and evaluating candidate assays to prospectively measure tumor telomere length  and have commenced the procedures for screening multiple tumor banks eg  small cell lung cancer  ovarian cancer and sarcomas to identify other solid tumor types 
table of contents with a significant number of patients that have tumors with short telomeres 
results of these activities may help us understand the potential for imetelstat in the treatment of solid tumors outside of nsclc 
discontinuation of grn and company restructuring in december  we discontinued development of grn  a novel peptide drug conjugate designed to treat cancers that have metastasized to the brain  based on an interim analysis for futility for grabm b  our phase trial in patients with brain metastases arising from breast cancer  and study enrollment challenges with grabm l  our phase trial in patients with brain metastases arising from non small cell lung cancer 
the grabm b and grabm l trials have been closed to further patient enrollment and we continue to follow the patients remaining in the trials 
in connection with the decision to discontinue development of grn  we provided to angiochem  inc notice of termination of both the exclusive license agreement under which we received rights to grn and an associated research collaboration and option agreement 
under the terms of the license agreement  the effective date of the termination is june  however  our obligations to complete the grabm b and grabm l trials may continue beyond that date 
in connection with the discontinuation of grn  we reduced our workforce from positions to full time positions  resulting in restructuring charges of approximately million related to one time termination benefits and impairment of various assets which were recognized in the fourth quarter of the remaining restructuring charge is expected to be recorded in the first half of we plan to sell the grn manufacturing equipment  the net proceeds of which may offset some of these future charges 
we expect the restructuring will result in aggregate cash expenditures of approximately million  of which  related to one time termination benefits that were paid as of december  and approximately million relates to one time termination benefits to be paid during discontinuation of human embryonic stem cell programs and divestiture of human embryonic stem cell assets in november  we discontinued further development of our stem cell programs 
with this decision  a total of full time positions were eliminated  resulting in restructuring charges of approximately million related to one time termination benefits and write downs of excess lab equipment and leasehold improvements that were recognized in the fourth quarter of in january  we entered into an asset contribution agreement  or the agreement  with biotime  inc  or biotime  and biotime recently formed subsidiary  biotime acquisition corporation  or bac  providing for the divestiture of all of our human embryonic stem cell assets  including intellectual property  proprietary technology  materials  equipment and reagents  contracts  regulatory filings  our phase clinical trial of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells  or grnopc  in patients with acute spinal cord injury  and our autologous cellular immunotherapy program  including data from the phase clinical trial of the autologous immunotherapy in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia  or our stem cell assets  to bac upon the closing of the transaction 
as consideration for the contribution of our human embryonic stem cell assets to bac  upon the closing  bac will issue to geron approximately million shares of its series a common stock  which we will distribute to our stockholders on a pro rata basis following the closing 
bac will also pay royalties to us on the sale of products that are commercialized  if any  in reliance upon our patents acquired by bac 
in addition  biotime will contribute to bac certain cash  stock and warrants 
some of these warrants will be distributed by bac  after the closing of the transaction  to the holders of bac series a common stock 
the transaction  which is expected to close no later than september   is subject to negotiated closing conditions  including certain approvals by biotime shareholders  the effectiveness of certain registration statements to be filed by biotime and bac with the united 
table of contents states securities and exchange commission  or the sec  with respect to the securities to be distributed as contemplated by the agreement  and other customary closing conditions 
prior to the closing  we are subject to certain obligations  including the obligation to exercise reasonable best efforts to preserve intact and maintain the assets to be contributed by us to bac upon the closing of the transaction  including our intellectual property rights and the continuation of patents in licensed from third parties 
if we are unable to preserve intact and maintain the assets to be contributed by us to bac  or if biotime or bac are unable to satisfy their obligations with respect to the transaction contemplated by the agreement  including the obligation to obtain the effectiveness of certain registration statements to be filed by them with the sec  we may be unable to fully complete the transaction with biotime and bac  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
upon the closing  bac will assume all post closing costs with respect to all of the assets contributed by us  including any costs related to the grnopc clinical trial 
additionally  upon the closing  bac will be substituted for us as a party in an appeal by us of two rulings by the us patent and trademark office board of patent appeals and interferences in favor of viacyte  inc related to two of our patent applications covering the production of endoderm from human embryonic stem cells part of the process for making pancreatic islet cells  and bac will assume all costs arising after the closing with respect to the appeal 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements fair value of financial instruments we categorize financial instruments recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value 
the categories are as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
an active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level inputs other than quoted market prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument anticipated life 
level inputs reflect management best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
a financial instrument categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet  including the category for such instruments 
we classify inputs to derive fair values for marketable securities available for sale as level and instruments classified as level include money market funds  representing of our total financial instruments measured at fair value classified as assets as of december  instruments classified as level include us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes  representing of our total financial instruments measured at fair value classified as assets as of december  the price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources 
periodically  we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes as well as reviewing the pricing methodologies used by our portfolio managers 
historically  we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio manager prices 
warrants to purchase common stock and non employee options are normally traded less actively  have trade activity that is one way  and or traded in less developed markets and are therefore valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters  resulting in level categorization 
instruments classified as level include derivative liabilities from non employee options  representing all of our financial instruments measured at fair value classified as liabilities as of december  the fair value for these instruments is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions regarding stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the non employee options and risk free interest rates 
changes to the model inputs are not changes to valuation methodologies  but instead reflect direct or indirect impacts from changes in market conditions 
accordingly  results from the valuation model in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock 
the expected term of non employee options represents the remaining contractual term of the instruments 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the remaining term of the instrument 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the fair value of these non employee options reflected as of 
table of contents each balance sheet date and the resulting change in fair value that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous periods 
as of december   we have not revised the method in which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  and we do not expect revisions in the future 
for a further discussion regarding fair value measurements  see note on fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from collaboration agreements and licensing arrangements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognize upfront non refundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license have been delivered and over the term of the agreement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs for services are rendered 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments  which are subject to substantive contingencies  upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process  according to contract terms 
royalties are generally recognized as revenue upon the receipt of the related royalty payment 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which has not been earned 
when payments are received in equity securities  we do not recognize any revenue unless such securities are determined to be realizable in cash 
we estimate the projected future term of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on contractual terms  historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated terms of these license agreements have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future terms of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions to the currently active agreements in the future 
clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for preclinical studies performed by our vendors based on certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue expenses for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites  and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  review of contractual terms and correspondence with cros 
we base our estimates on the best information available at the time 
however  additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods 
in this event  we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain 
valuation of stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards to our employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock plan purchases 
option pricing valuation model assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term impact the fair value estimate 

table of contents further  the estimated forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate stock based compensation expense recognized during the period 
the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchases is amortized over the vesting period of the awards using a straight line method 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on geron stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in deriving this assumption  we reviewed actual historical exercise and cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled 
the expected term of employees purchase rights under our espp is equal to the purchase period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data and are adjusted  if necessary  over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimate 
we grant restricted stock awards to employees and non employee directors with three types of vesting schedules i service based  ii performance based or iii market based 
service based restricted stock awards generally vest annually over four years 
performance based stock awards vest only upon achievement of discrete strategic goals within a specified performance period  generally three years 
market based stock awards vest only upon achievement of certain market price thresholds of our common stock within a specified performance period  generally three years 
the fair value for service based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense is amortized over the requisite service period of the award on a straight line basis and reduced for estimated forfeitures  as applicable 
the fair value for performance based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met and reduced for estimated forfeitures  as applicable 
if the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved  no expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met  if ever 
we evaluate whether performance conditions are probable of occurring  as well as the expected performance period  on a quarterly basis 
the fair value for market based restricted stock awards is determined using a lattice valuation model with a monte carlo simulation 
the model takes into consideration the historical volatility of our stock and the risk free interest rate at the date of grant 
in addition  the model is used to estimate the derived service period for the awards 
the derived service period is the estimated period of time that would be required to satisfy the market condition  assuming the market condition will be satisfied 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the derived service period using the straight line method and reduced for estimated forfeitures  as applicable  but is accelerated if the market condition is achieved earlier than estimated 
we evaluate the assumptions used in estimating fair values of our stock based awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data on an annual basis 
we have not revised the methods by which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of our stock based awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the stock based compensation expense that we record for awards to employees and directors may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
compensation expense recognized for stock based awards to employees and directors was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock awards not yet recognized  net of estimated forfeitures and assuming no probability of achievement for outstanding 
table of contents performance based restricted stock awards  was million  which is expected to be recognized over the next months on a weighted average basis 
for our non employee stock based awards  the measurement date on which the fair value of the stock based award is calculated is equal to the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the counterparty performance is complete 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of   and  for the fair value of the vested portion of non employee options and restricted stock awards in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future  based upon the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborators  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of preclinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product candidate to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidate  imetelstat  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized revenues from collaborative agreements of  and  in and  respectively 
revenues from collaborative agreements in and primarily reflected revenue recognized under our collaboration with ge healthcare uk  ltd  or ge healthcare  which began in july no comparable amount was recognized in because the collaboration with ge healthcare concluded in june we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are eligible to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales  or any combination thereof 
we recognized license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to our various agreements 
the increase in license fee revenues in compared to primarily reflects the full recognition of a license payment from ge healthcare related to the exercise of an option to expand the scope of their original license agreement 
under the expanded license  ge healthcare obtained exclusive global rights to our intellectual property and know how for the development and sale of cellular assays derived from induced pluripotent stem cells 
the decrease in license fee revenues in compared to primarily reflects the full recognition of the upfront non refundable license fees under the ge healthcare agreement upon the conclusion of the collaboration in june current revenues may not be predictive of future revenues 
we recognized royalty revenues of million   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the 
table of contents research use only market  cell based research products and nutritional products 
future license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and current agreements being maintained 
upon the closing of the divestiture of the stem cell assets  the license with ge healthcare  including any future revenue payments thereunder  will be transferred to bac 
in addition  the assignment of our telomerase activation technology to telomerase activation sciences  inc  or ta sciences  will reduce future royalty revenues 
see interest and other income for a discussion of the agreement with ta sciences 
research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur direct external  personnel related and other research and development costs 
direct external expenses primarily consist of costs to outside parties to perform laboratory studies  develop manufacturing processes and manufacture raw materials and clinical trial drug materials  conduct and manage clinical trials and provide advice and consultation for scientific and clinical strategies 
personnel related expenses primarily consist of salaries and wages  stock based compensation  payroll taxes and benefits for those individuals involved with ongoing research and development efforts 
other research and development expenses primarily consist of laboratory supplies  research related overhead associated with leasing  operating and maintaining our facilities and equipment depreciation and maintenance 
these costs apply to our clinical programs  preclinical programs as well as our discovery research efforts 
product candidates are designated clinical candidates once an investigational new drug application has been filed with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can commence 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as shown in the table below  the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to reflects the net result of reduced costs due to the discontinued development of our stem cell programs and lower direct external research and development costs for the manufacturing of imetelstat drug product resulting from the timing of manufacturing campaigns  partially offset by increased direct external research and development costs for our phase clinical trials of grn in patients with brain metastases that were initiated in december the discontinuation of our stem cell programs resulted in reduced direct external research and development costs for our phase trial of grnopc for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury  decreased personnel related costs and lower other research and development expenses  mainly for scientific supplies 
the increase in compared to was primarily the net result of increased direct external research and development costs for the enrollment of four phase clinical trials of imetelstat and higher clinical drug product purchases and manufacturing costs related to imetelstat and grn  partially offset by lower other research and development expenses  mainly for scientific supplies  resulting from our decision in november to discontinue development of our stem cell programs 
overall  we expect research and development expenses to decrease in as a result of our decision to discontinue development of grn and focus on the development of imetelstat 

table of contents research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands direct external research and development expenses clinical program imetelstat clinical program grn clinical program grnopc preclinical programs personnel related expenses all other research and development expenses total at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to commercialize imetelstat 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of imetelstat  see the sub sections titled risks related to our business and risks related to clinical and commercialization activities in part i  item a entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
acquired in process research and development as consideration for the license rights to angiochem proprietary peptide technology for the clinical development of ang now grn  we paid angiochem an upfront payment of million in cash in december and on january   issued  shares of common stock to angiochem as payment of our obligation to issue million in stock 
as further clinical and process development of grn was required before any viable commercial application could be identified or utilized  we concluded that the technology had no alternative future use  and accordingly  expensed the total upfront payment of million in connection with the license agreement as acquired in process research and development expense at the time of acquisition in see note on license agreements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the exclusive license agreement with angiochem and our recent notice of termination to them 
restructuring charges in december  we announced the decision to discontinue development of grn and reduce our workforce from positions to full time positions 
of the positions eliminated  as of february   ten employees were continuing to provide services through various dates in the first half of in connection with the restructuring  we recorded aggregate restructuring charges of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  of which million related to one time termination benefits  including  for non cash stock based compensation expense relating to the extension of the post termination exercise period for certain stock options previously granted to terminated employees through the end of december  and  related to write downs of grn manufacturing equipment 
in november  we announced the decision to focus on the development of our oncology programs and consequently  we discontinued further development of our stem cell programs 
with this decision  a total of full time positions were eliminated 
of those  employees continued to provide services through various dates in the first half of in connection with the restructuring  we recorded aggregate restructuring charges of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  of 
table of contents which million related to one time termination benefits  including  for non cash stock based compensation expense relating to the extension of the post termination exercise period for certain stock options previously granted to terminated employees through the end of june and december  and  related to write downs of excess lab equipment and leasehold improvements and other charges 
see note on restructurings in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the restructuring charges 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to primarily reflects lower non cash stock based compensation expense of million  partially offset by higher legal and consulting fees of million associated with our intellectual property portfolio and our stem cell divestiture efforts 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of higher non cash stock based compensation expense of million related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and directors  severance expenses of million related to separation agreements executed with our former chief executive officer  or ceo  and former chief financial officer  or cfo  and higher corporate legal and consulting fees of million 
unrealized gain on derivatives unrealized gain on derivatives reflects a non cash adjustment for changes in fair value of options held by non employees that are classified as current liabilities 
derivatives classified as assets or liabilities are marked to fair value at each financial reporting date with any resulting unrealized gain loss recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the derivatives continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require them to be recorded as assets or liabilities  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
we incurred unrealized gains on derivatives of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively which reflected reduced fair values of derivative liabilities resulting from shortening of their contractual terms  decreases in the market value of our stock and changes in other inputs factored into the estimate of their fair value  such as the volatility of our stock 
see note on fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the fair value of derivatives 
interest and other income interest income was  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to reflects lower cash and investment balances resulting from the use of cash for operations 
the increase in compared to was due to higher cash and investment balances for the majority of as a result of the receipt of million in net proceeds in december from an underwritten public offering of our common stock 
interest earned in future periods will depend on the size of our securities portfolio and prevailing interest rates 
other income was million  zero and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in december  we received a non refundable upfront payment of million for the assignment of our telomerase activation technology to ta sciences pursuant to the termination and assignment agreement that geron entered into with asia biotech corporation  or asia biotech  and ta sciences on december  in november  we received a total of million in grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project  or qtdp  program 
the maximum grant amount was awarded to each of the five geron programs that were eligible for qtdp funding and included oncology and human embryonic stem cell projects 
see note on license

losses recognized under equity method investment we owned of viagen  inc  or viagen  a licensee with in house breeding services and expertise in advanced reproductive technologies for animal cloning 
in november  we provided a loan of million to viagen to fund its operations 
the loan represented additional financial support to viagen and funded approximately  in prior losses of the company which has been included in losses recognized under equity method investment in in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we recognized losses of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for our proportionate share of viagen losses 
no comparable amount was recognized in because we suspended the equity method of accounting in june since our proportionate share of net losses exceeded the value of our investment and we had no commitments to provide financial support or obligations to perform services or other activities for viagen 
in september  we sold our entire equity interest in viagen to trans ova genetics  lc see note on equity method investment in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of our investment in viagen and sale to trans ova genetics  lc losses recognized from debt extinguishment in november  we repaid the outstanding principal balance  including accrued interest  or loan balance  to the california institute for regenerative medicine  or cirm  representing our entire loan balance under our loan agreement with cirm 
in addition  we relinquished our right to future disbursements from cirm under the loan agreement and gave notice of termination 
with the repayment of the entire outstanding loan balance  we have no further amounts owed to cirm 
in connection with the early termination of the loan agreement  we recognized a debt extinguishment charge of million for the unamortized debt discount associated with the loan 
see note on long term debt in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for a further discussion of the loan from cirm

liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  certificates of deposit  municipal securities  us government and agency securities  corporate notes and commercial paper 
our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub prime mortgages  collateralized debt obligations  asset backed securities or auction rate securities and  to date  we have not recognized any other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity 
to date  we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents  however  access to our invested cash and cash equivalents may be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets 
the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in and was the result of cash being used for operations 
in october  we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mlv co 
llc  or mlv  which provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the sales agreement  we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through mlv as our sales agent 
we are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the sales agreement 
to date  we have not sold any common stock pursuant to the sales agreement 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  amounts available to us under our equipment financing facility and future interest income will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least the next months 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the unexpected expenditure of available resources 
factors that may require us to use our available capital resources sooner than we anticipate include the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs for and beyond  changes in our clinical development plans for imetelstat  our ability to meaningfully reduce manufacturing costs of imetelstat  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  including the number and type of product candidates and indications we intend to pursue  the progress we make in our research and development programs  preclinical development and clinical trials  as well as in investigator sponsored trials  
table of contents our ability to establish  enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  our ability to fully complete the divestiture of our stem cell assets to bac  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
if our existing capital resources  equipment financing arrangement and future interest income are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
we anticipate that we would need to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  including pursuant to our sales agreement with mlv  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if imetelstat fails to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or imetelstat or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operations in compared to was primarily the result of discontinuing development of our stem cell programs in november the increase in net cash used in operations in compared to was primarily the net result of increased research and development expenses associated with our clinical operations and reduced issuances of our common stock in exchange for services

in addition to the minimum payments due under all of our current research collaborations and license agreements  we may be required to pay royalties on any product sales and up to an aggregate of million in development milestone payments  in the event that all clinical development milestone events under these agreements are achieved

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we currently place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with five financial institutions in the united states 
deposits with banks may exceed the 
table of contents amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities currently consist of money market funds  us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our investment policy  approved by the audit committee of our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
we limit our credit and liquidity risks through our investment policy and through regular reviews of our portfolio against our policy 
to date  we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts or to our cash equivalents and marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
the effect of a hypothetical decrease of in the average yield earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities would have resulted in an immaterial decrease in our interest income for the year ended december  interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in widely diversified investments consisting of both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  which both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash equivalents which are due in less than days and million of short term investments which are due in less than one year 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily money market funds  us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our operating results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant given our cash balances held in foreign currencies represent less than one percent of our total cash and investment balances as of december  further  the effect of an immediate change in foreign currency rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows at december  as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
