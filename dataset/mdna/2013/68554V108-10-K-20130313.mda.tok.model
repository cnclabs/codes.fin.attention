readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
we undertake no duty to update any forward looking statements made herein after the date of this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview we are a leader in the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using our proprietary oral fluid technologies  as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types 
our diagnostic products include tests that are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care and tests that are processed in a laboratory 
in september  we began selling the first and only rapid point of care hiv test approved for use in the domestic consumer retail market 
dnag  a canadian subsidiary acquired on august   manufactures and sell kits that are used to collect  stabilize  and store samples of genetic material for molecular testing in the academic research  clinical genetic testing  pharmacogenomics  personalized medicine  animal and livestock genetics markets 
we also manufacture and sell medical devices used for the removal of benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
one of our cryosurgery products is sold in the over the counter or consumer retail market in north america  europe  central and south america  and australia 
our products are sold in the united states and internationally to various clinical laboratories  hospitals  clinics  community based organizations and other public health organizations  research and academic institutions  distributors  government agencies  physicians offices  and commercial and industrial entities 
current consolidated financial results during the year ended december   our consolidated net revenues were million compared to million for the year ended december  net product revenues during the year ended december  increased when compared to  primarily as a result of the inclusion of dnag revenues for all of full year net revenues from our molecular collection systems subsidiary were million  compared to million in for the period from the august  acquisition date through december  licensing and product development revenues for increased as a result of a million milestone payment received from our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives pursuant to the terms of our hcv collaboration agreement with merck 
the initial term of our domestic collaboration agreement with merck expired in september and was not renewed 
we are also in the process of terminating our international agreement with merck 
termination of these agreements is not expected to have a material impact on sales of our oraquick hcv test  either in the us or in international markets 
the milestone payment was partially offset by a decrease in the royalty rate paid to us on domestic outsales of merck s otc cryosurgical wart removal product  pursuant to a license and settlement agreement executed in january our consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  our loss for the current period included million in costs associated with the commercialization of our oraquick in home hiv test 
our consolidated net loss for the year ended december  included million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of dnag and million of clinical trial spending related to our oraquick in home hiv test 

table of contents cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million used during the year ended december  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  during  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock and received million in proceeds  net of offering expenses 
on july   we repaid the million principal balance outstanding under our million credit facility with comerica bank 
during  we used million of our cash to fund the dnag acquisition and related transaction expenses 
developments oraquick in home hiv test on july   the fda issued a pre market approval of our oraquick in home hiv test for sale directly to consumers in the otc market  making it the first and only rapid hiv otc test approved in the us the oraquick in home hiv test can detect antibodies to both hiv and hiv with an oral swab with results in as little as minutes  providing a confidential in home testing option to consumers 
it is the first rapid diagnostic test for any infectious disease that has been approved by the fda for sale over the counter 
this test was approved following extensive clinical trials conducted during the past several years 
the oraquick in home hiv test has been available for purchase by consumers since september throughout the country  at retailers such as cvs  walgreens  rite aid  wal mart and kroger 
the product is also available for purchase on line through certain retailers and our website  www 
oraquick 
com 
we began our national public relations and advertising campaign in connection with the september product launch 
these activities substantially increased our sales and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of and are expected to continue to substantially increase sales and marketing expenses in to support individuals that purchase and use our test  we have established a toll free customer support center that operates on a  day per year basis 
through this center  consumers will have access to highly trained  bi lingual representatives who can answer questions about hiv aids and the use of our test  and refer consumers to appropriate resources for follow up confirmatory testing  counseling and medical treatment 
our revenue recognition practices with respect to the oraquick in home hiv test initially will be different than those customarily used in the consumer package goods industry 
because this is a new product for which we do not have a historical record of returns  we will initially recognize revenue only upon the consummation of a sale to the retail customer either in a store or over the internet 
public offering of common stock on july   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  at a price of per share  resulting in total proceeds of million before expenses of the offering 
in connection with the offering  we paid million in underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred  in additional offering expenses 
economic outlook current unfavorable economic conditions may continue for the foreseeable future and could intensify 
these conditions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers 
many of our customers rely on public funding provided by federal  state and local governments  and this funding has been and may continue to be reduced or deferred as a result of current economic conditions or sequestration 
these circumstances may adversely impact our customers and suppliers  which  in turn  could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment  raw materials or components 
in addition  these circumstances could adversely affect our access to liquidity that may be needed to conduct or expand our business  conduct future acquisitions or make other discretionary investments 

table of contents in recent years  there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for  the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services in the united states 
one example is the affordable care act  the federal healthcare reform law enacted in the affordable care act imposes a excise tax on certain transactions  including us sales of many medical devices  which will include domestic non retail sales of some of our products 
this new tax became effective in january and will have a negative impact on our gross margin 
also  on august   president obama signed into law the budget control act of  which was designed to reduce federal spending over the next years by trillion 
under that law  a select committee of congress was tasked with identifying and recommending trillion in spending cuts by late november because the committee did not agree on spending cuts within that time frame  certain automatic cuts to discretionary  national defense and medicare spending became effective on march  although the full impact is uncertain  the spending cuts implemented under this new law could adversely affect our customers ability to purchase our products 
business segments we operate our business within two reportable segments our osur business  which consists of the development  manufacture and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products  specimen collection devices  and medical devices used for the removal of benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  and our dnag or molecular collection systems business  which consists of the development  manufacture and sale of oral fluid collection devices that are used to collect  stabilize  and store samples of genetic material for molecular testing 
osur revenues consist primarily of products sold into the united states and internationally to various clinical laboratories  hospitals  clinics  community based organizations and other public health organizations  distributors  government agencies  physicians offices  and commercial and industrial entities 
osur also derives revenues from licensing and product development activities 
dnag revenues consist of products sold into the academic research  clinical genetic testing  pharmacogenomics  personalized medicine  animal and livestock genetics markets 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december  consolidated net revenues the table below shows the amount of total net product revenues dollars in thousands generated by each of our business segments and net revenue generated by licensing and product development activities 
year ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues osur dnag net product revenues licensing and product development net revenues consolidated net revenues increased to million in from million in the current year included million in net revenues from our molecular collection systems subsidiary  dnag  compared to million in results for reflect a full twelve months of molecular collection systems sales  while results include only those revenues generated from the august  acquisition date through year end 

table of contents net product revenues increased during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the higher molecular collection system sales and higher sales of our cryosurgical systems products 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of our infectious disease testing  substance abuse testing and insurance risk assessment products 
licensing and product development revenues also increased in as compared to the prior year 
consolidated net revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the us were million and million  or and of total net revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily caused by the inclusion of a full twelve months of revenues from dnag 
because the majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars  the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates was not material to our operating results 
net revenues by segment osur segment the table below shows the amount of total net revenues dollars in thousands generated by our osur segment in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
year ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment net product revenues licensing and product development net revenues infectious disease testing market sales to the infectious disease testing market decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower oraquick sales

the table below shows a breakdown of our total net oraquick revenues dollars in thousands during and year ended december  market change domestic hiv international hiv domestic otc hiv n a domestic hcv international hcv net oraquick revenues domestic oraquick hiv sales decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due to changes in public health testing programs and their timing of purchases  reductions in 
table of contents government funding  price competition and a shift to automated laboratory based blood tests by certain customers 
international sales of our oraquick hiv test increased to million in from million in as a result of higher sales in africa due to changes in existing distributor order patterns 
we began shipping our oraquick in home hiv test to the retail outlets at the end of september we recorded  in gross revenues from product sales to retail customers either in a store or over the internet 
these revenues were offset by  in customer allowances  including cooperative advertising  cash discounts  and other allowances  which were netted against gross revenues in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
domestic oraquick hcv sales increased to million in from  in as result of broader adoption of our product by customers who are able to use a clia waived product 
we received a clia waiver for this product in november  allowing us to sell our hcv product to many non clia certified customers  such as outreach clinics  community based organizations and physician offices 
while we believe the clia waiver provides an expanded opportunity for sales growth  demand for our hcv product has been  and will likely continue to be  tempered by the limited availability of government funding allocated to hcv testing efforts and the time and effort required to build awareness and demand for rapid hcv testing 
international sales of our oraquick hcv test increased to million in from  in  largely as a result of higher sales into latin america and europe 
we previously entered into domestic and international collaboration agreements with merck  under which merck agreed to detail our oraquick hcv product to physician offices 
the initial term of our domestic agreement expired in september and was not renewed 
we have also terminated our international agreement with merck 
termination of these agreements is not expected to have a material impact on sales of our oraquick hcv test  either in the us or in international markets 
sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device decreased to  in from million in some customers who have purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are now electing to purchase our oraquick advance or our oraquick in home hiv tests 
we believe this is the result of customers recognizing the benefits of rapid hiv testing  especially with oral fluid 
as such  we expect that sales of our orasure device will continue to decline in the future 
substance abuse testing market net substance abuse testing revenues decreased to million in from million in  as a result of lower sales of our intercept drug testing system 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total net intercept revenues dollars in thousands generated in each market during and year ended december  market change domestic international net intercept revenues domestic intercept sales decreased to million in from million in in  our largest laboratory distributor began selling its own competing oral specimen collection device and a panel of oral fluid drug assays suitable for use on fully automated high throughput homogenous processing systems 
as a result  by the end of  this distributor had stopped purchasing our intercept product line 
intercept sales to this distributor were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents international intercept sales decreased to  in from million in  as a result of lower purchases by our uk laboratory distributor as it also has begun selling its own competing oral specimen collection device 
we expect sales to this distributor to remain flat in intercept sales to this distributor were  for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  during  in an effort to expand our intercept product line and meet the needs of our laboratory customers  we entered into a joint development agreement with roche diagnostics to develop a series of homogeneous fully automated oral fluid drugs of abuse assays 
fda k clearance has since been received for assays to detect pcp  opiates  cocaine  methamphetamines and amphetamines 
however  we have experienced significant delays in completing development of the assays under our collaboration  primarily because roche has not been able to obtain fda clearance of a thc assay 
a thc assay is needed to offer a complete nida panel of assays required by our customers 
the inability to obtain clearance of this assay has also delayed development of assays beyond the nida panel 
we are in discussions with roche about the thc assay and the future of our collaboration 
cryosurgical systems market sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the table below shows a breakdown of our total net cryosurgical revenues dollars in thousands generated in each market during and year ended december  market change professional domestic professional international over the counter net cryosurgical systems revenues sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states increased to million in  compared to million in  due to the success of sales and promotional efforts by our distributors 
during the year ended december   international sales of histofreezer increased to million compared to million in the same period of the prior year  largely as a result of higher out sales in australia by our distributor in that new market 
sales of our otc cryosurgical products during increased to million from million in this increase was largely the result of higher sales to both our latin american distributor  genomma  and our european distributor  reckitt benckiser 
in  genomma purchased million compared to  during early in  the mexican government placed limitations on the advertising genomma could use for our product 
at the same time  the brazilian government also required changes to our package insert 
both of these events negatively impacted sales of our product to genomma during  but were resolved by the end of that year 
sales to reckitt benckiser increased to million in from million in as a result of increased advertising and promotional activities and expansion into additional european countries 
our distribution contract with reckitt benckiser has expired and we are currently negotiating the final terms of the renewal of this agreement 

table of contents insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market decreased to million in from million in  largely as a result of the loss of one of our larger customers who changed its underwriting methodologies in licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues increased to million in from million in during the first quarter of  we received a million milestone payment as a result of our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives pursuant to our collaboration agreement with merck for the development and promotion of our oraquick rapid hcv test in international markets 
no such milestone payments were received in the prior year 
the remaining licensing revenues for these periods represent royalties paid on domestic outsales of merck s otc cryosurgical wart removal product  pursuant to a license and settlement agreement executed in january in the latter half of  the royalty rate decreased pursuant to the terms of our license 
royalties under this license will no longer be payable after certain of our cryosurgical patents expire in august dnag segment molecular collection systems net molecular collection systems revenues primarily represent sales of the oragene product line by our subsidiary  dna genotek  which we acquired in august during  net dnag revenues included several new orders from large commercial customers as well as continued strong sales into the academic research market despite funding challenges in both canada and the united states 
consolidated operating loss consolidated gross margin remained unchanged at for both and consolidated operating loss increased million to million in  compared to million in the increased loss was primarily the result of higher sales and marketing expenses associated with the commercialization of our oraquick in home hiv test and the inclusion of a full year of dnag operating expenses 
these higher expenses were partially offset by lower research and development costs due to decreased clinical trial costs related to our oraquick in home hiv test 
operating loss by segment osur segment osur s gross margin was in compared to in osur s margin was negatively impacted by the overall decrease in sales volume which caused a decline in absorption of our labor and fixed overhead costs 
this decline was partially offset by the beneficial impact of the million hcv milestone payment received in the first quarter of beginning in january and continuing through february  sales of our oraquick product into the professional market are subject to an increase in certain lateral flow patent royalties under a litigation settlement we agreed to in in addition  also beginning in january  certain of our product revenues are subject to a medical device excise tax imposed under the affordable care act 
the higher royalties and new excise tax will negatively impact gross margins in and beyond 

table of contents research and development expenses declined to million in from million in  primarily as a result of lower clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick in home hiv test 
we expect osur s research and development costs in will remain flat when compared to levels 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of approximately million of spending associated with the commercialization of our oraquick in home hiv test 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase from levels as we continue to invest in advertising and promotional costs for this product 
general and administrative expenses remained flat at million in both and we expect general and administrative expenses in to decline slightly when compared to all the above contributed to osur s operating loss of million  which included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization expense and million of stock based compensation expense 
dnag segment dnag s gross margin increased to in from in the comparable period of dnag s gross margin included the impact of an  non cash purchase accounting adjustment to mark up the acquired finished goods inventory to fair value 
gross margin for also included million of intangibles amortization expense compared to  recorded for the period august  through december  dnag incurred million in operating expenses during compared to million incurred in from the august  acquisition date through december  expenses for included million of research and development costs  million of sales and marketing costs and million of general and administrative costs 
expenses for the period august  through december  included million of research and development costs  million of sales and marketing costs and million of general and administrative costs 
we expect research and development expense and sales and marketing expense to increase slightly when compared to levels 
general and administrative expenses in are expected to remain flat 
all of the above contributed to dnag s operating loss of million  which included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization expense and  of stock based compensation expense 
consolidated income taxes we continue to believe the full valuation allowance established in against osur s total us net deferred tax asset is appropriate as the facts and circumstances necessitating the allowance have not changed 
as a result  no us income tax benefit was recorded for orasure s pre tax loss in a canadian income tax benefit of million was recorded in which was associated with the dnag loss before income taxes and certain canadian research and development and investment tax credits 
the income tax benefit for the current year was negatively impacted by a  adjustment to dnag s deferred tax liability recorded in the second quarter of to reflect a change in the enacted canadian provincial tax rates 
the canadian income tax benefit is considered realizable based upon the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of dnag

in early  we signed agreements with two manufacturers sales representative organizations to support sales of our histofreezer product in the us under these agreements  over additional sales representatives have been working with our physicians office distributors throughout the unites states 
sales of histofreezer in the international market remained flat at million in and during the year ended december   our otc cryosurgical sales decreased primarily due to a decline in sales to our latin american distributor  genomma 
genomma had purchases totaling million in  compared to million in in late  the mexican government placed limitations on the advertising genomma could use for our product 
in addition  during the first quarter of  genomma informed us of some changes required by the brazilian government to our package insert  which have since been made 
both events negatively impacted sales of our product during sales to our european otc distributor reckitt benckiser remained flat at million in and insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market decreased from million in to million in  as a result of variability in the timing of orders  general softness in the life insurance market  and the adoption by some underwriters of a simplified issues policy 
this is a policy where lab based testing is replaced by having applicants respond to a questionnaire about their behaviors 
two of our larger customers adopted this new policy form in licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues decreased to million in from million in during  we received million in milestone payments as a result of our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives pursuant to our collaboration agreement with merck for the development and promotion of our oraquick rapid hcv test in europe 
the remaining licensing revenues for these periods represent royalties received on domestic outsales of merck s otc cryosurgical wart removal product  pursuant to a license and settlement agreement executed in january 
table of contents dnag segment molecular collection systems net molecular collection systems revenues primarily represent sales of dnag s oragene product line in the molecular diagnostics and research markets 
the million in net revenues reflect dnag sales from the august  acquisition date through december  during the fourth quarter of  dnag shipped million of product to its largest customer  which historically has made bulk purchases once a year 
consolidated operating loss consolidated operating loss increased million to million in  compared to million in the increased loss was primarily caused by higher research and development expenses due to increased clinical trial costs related to our oraquick hiv otc test and higher general and administrative expense resulting from the transaction costs associated with the dnag acquisition and increased amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in the dnag acquisition 
consolidated gross margin was for both and operating loss by segment osur segment osur s gross margin was in compared to in osur s margin benefited from improved product mix  more efficient manufacturing operations  lower direct labor costs  improved absorption of overhead costs as a result of staffing optimization and a change to automated manufacturing during the margin benefited from the million in hcv milestone payments received during that period 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of a million increase in clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hiv otc test 
higher clinical trial costs related to our oraquick hiv otc test were partially offset by lower clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hcv test 
sales and marketing expenses declined to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower consulting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of million in transaction costs associated with the dnag acquisition

dnag s gross margin also included approximately  of amortization expense related to the acquisition 
dnag incurred million in operating expenses during this included million of research and development costs  million of sales and marketing expenses and million of general and administrative expenses 
the dnag expenses also included a total of  of amortization expense related to the acquisition 
consolidated income taxes in  we continued our evaluation of whether the full valuation allowance established in against osur s total us net deferred tax asset is still appropriate and concluded that the full valuation allowance remained appropriate as the facts and circumstances since the establishment of the allowance had not changed 

table of contents as a result  no us income tax benefit was recorded for osur s pre tax loss in in connection with the dnag acquisition  a deferred income tax liability was recorded to reflect the tax effects of basis differences of intangible assets and inventories for financial reporting and canadian income tax purposes 
a canadian income tax benefit of  was also recorded in associated with the dnag loss before income taxes and certain canadian research and development and investment tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash working capital our cash increased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to receipt of million in net proceeds from a secondary public offering of our common stock completed during the third quarter of our working capital also increased to million at december  from million at december  during  we used million in cash to finance our operating activities 
our net loss of million and deferred income tax benefit of million were partially offset by non cash stock based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
additional uses of cash in operating activities included a  increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory largely due to the stocking of our oraquick in home hiv tests and a  decrease in accounts payable 
accrued expenses decreased million due to lower year end accruals for management incentive bonuses  professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
offsetting these uses of cash was a million increase in deferred revenue primarily related to the initial pipeline orders of our oraquick in home test by retailers in late september we used a total of million in investing activities during to acquire property and equipment 
during the year ended december   we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily to purchase additional equipment  upgrade certain older equipment and make improvements to our facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which primarily resulted from the million of net proceeds received from our secondary offering of million shares of common stock in july and million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
these increases in cash were partially offset by million in loan principal repayments and million used for the repurchase of common stock related to the vesting of restricted shares 
on july   we repaid the million principal balance outstanding under our million credit facility with comerica bank and this facility has been terminated 
our current cash balance is expected to be sufficient to fund our current operating and capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of future strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the cost of any future litigation  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing and amount of costs to commercially launch new products including our oraquick in home hiv test  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments  the impact of the ongoing economic downturn and other factors

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  contingencies and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are recorded net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights other than for our oraquick in home hiv tests  which we began to sell in the third quarter of to our customers  except for warranty returns 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 

table of contents our revenue practices with respect to the oraquick in home hiv test will initially be different than those customarily used in the consumer package goods industry 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  product revenue can not be recognized unless the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
because our oraquick in home hiv test is a new product for which we do not have a historical record of returns  we do not believe we can reasonably determine a return rate at this time 
as a result we do not recognize revenue upon shipment to the retail trade 
for these product shipments  we invoice the retailer or distributor  record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the product held by the retailer or distributor as a component of inventory 
initially  we will only recognize revenue upon the consummation of a sale to the retail customer either in a store or over the internet 
we expect to apply a more traditional revenue recognition policy such that revenue is recognized following shipment to the retailer or distributor when we believe we have sufficient data to develop reasonable estimate of the level of expected returns based upon historical returns 
our net revenues recorded on sales of the oraquick in home hiv test represent total gross revenue less customer allowances  including estimates for cooperative advertising  discounts  rebates  and chargebacks 
these allowances are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when recognized in the statement of operations 
these allowances are established by management as our best estimate based on available information and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these estimates 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
we record shipping and handling charges billed to our customers as product revenue and the related expense as cost of products sold 
taxes assessed by governmental authorities  such as sales or value added taxes  are excluded from product revenues 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  as of december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
the current economic environment could adversely affect the operations  cash flows and financial condition of our customers 
these circumstances may adversely impact the liquidity or financial position of our customers and could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate quantities on hand and the carrying value of our inventories to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the estimated forecast of product sales 
when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off  as in the case of lapsing expiration dates 
in  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of million 
during and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of  and  respectively 
these write offs were as a result of quality  scrap and product expiration issues 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we recognize the fair value of equity based awards as compensation expense in our statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this valuation model s computations incorporate highly subjective assumptions  such as the expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of the options  after considering the effect of expected forfeitures  is then amortized  generally on a straight line basis  over the related vesting period of the option 
the fair value of our restricted shares is based on the market value of the shares at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the related vesting period of the award 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
together  these assets had a net book value of million  or of our total assets  as of december  property and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of our assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from all remaining long lived and intangible assets as of december  will exceed their book value 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for the years ended december  or any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of dnag 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if we believe that indicators of impairment exist 
performance of goodwill impairment testing permits us to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then we would not be required to perform the two step quantitative impairment test 
otherwise  performing the two step impairment test is necessary 
the first step of the two step quantitative impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the test to determine the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step involves measuring any impairment by comparing the implied fair values of the affected reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets with the respective carrying values 
we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill as of july  and determined there was no impairment 
our assessment determined that our dnag reporting unit had a fair value in excess of its carrying value including goodwill of  of approximately 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting unit 
if actual future results  including projected revenue growth  are not consistent with management s estimates and assumptions  we may have to take an impairment charge in the future related to our goodwill 
future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal third quarter  or sooner if a triggering event occurs 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of million 
the net deferred tax assets  before a full valuation allowance  associated with these nols and other temporary differences was million at december  in assessing the realizability of net 
table of contents deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we currently have a full valuation allowance recorded against our total us net deferred tax asset as we had determined in that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax asset in the immediate future 
each year  we continued to reevaluate our valuation allowance position and believe that it is more likely than not that our us deferred income tax asset will not be realized in the immediate future 
as such  we maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of december  and associated with the operations subject to income tax in the us our ability to use our federal nol carryforwards to offset future federal income tax obligations could be limited by changes in the ownership of our stock 
internal revenue code irc section contains provisions that limit the amount of federal nol carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
during  the company completed an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any irc section ownership changes had occurred that would limit the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our future taxable income 
the company continues to review ownership changes on an annual basis and we do not believe we have had a subsequent ownership change that would impact the nols 
in connection with the dnag acquisition in august  a deferred tax liability was recorded to reflect the tax effects of basis differences of intangible assets and inventories for financial reporting and canadian income tax purposes 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a canadian income tax benefit of million and  respectively  associated with dnag s loss before income taxes and certain canadian research and development and investment tax credits 
the income tax benefit associated with dnag was considered realizable based upon the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of dnag 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we record a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in canada  europe and africa  which are subject 
table of contents to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from foreign currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency were of our total consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  including revenues from dnag 
we expect the dnag business will continue to grow and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may increase
