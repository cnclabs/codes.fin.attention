item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing innovative anti cancer agents in the united states  europe and additional international markets 
we target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations  and seek to simultaneously develop  with partners  companion diagnostics that direct our product candidates to the patients that are most likely to benefit from their use 
we are currently developing two product candidates for which we hold global marketing rights co  an orally available  small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  covalent inhibitor that is in phase i ii clinical development for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  in patients with activating egfr mutations  including the initial activating mutations  as well as the primary resistance mutation  tm  and rucaparib  an orally available  small molecule poly adp ribose polymerase  or parp  inhibitor being developed for various solid tumors that is currently in phase i ii clinical trials 
we have also entered into a drug discovery agreement for the discovery of a novel kit inhibitor targeting resistance mutations for the treatment of gist  a gastrointestinal cancer 
if any clinical candidates are discovered  we would seek to pursue clinical development of such clinical candidates 

table of contents we were incorporated in delaware in april and commenced operations in may to date  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identifying and in licensing product candidates  performing development activities with respect to those product candidates  and the general and administrative support of these operations 
we have generated no revenues and  through december   have principally funded our operations using the million of net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock  the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes  and million of net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock completed in november and april the convertible preferred stock and outstanding principal amount of the convertible promissory notes and all accrued and unpaid interest converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering in november we have never been profitable and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred losses of million  million  million and million for the period from april  inception through december  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through clinical development to seek regulatory approval and  if approved  commercialize such product candidates 
we will need additional financing to support our operating activities 
we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources 
adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase as we continue the development of our product candidates 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and we may never do so 
the financial information presented from april  inception to december  was based solely on the results of clovis oncology  inc subsequent to january   the financial information is consolidated and includes the results of our wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom 
all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in this consolidation 
product license agreements co in november  we entered into a license agreement with clavis to develop and commercialize co in north america  central america  south america and europe 
under the terms of the license agreement  we made an up front payment to clavis in the amount of million  which was comprised of million for development costs incurred prior to the execution of the agreement  which we recognized as acquired in process research and development and million for the prepayment of preclinical activities to be performed by clavis 
in november  the license agreement was amended to expand the license territory to include asia and other international markets 
we paid clavis million for the territory expansion and recognized that payment as acquired in process research and development expense 
as part of the amendment to the license agreement  clavis agreed to reimburse up to million of our research and development costs for certain co development activities subject to our incurring such costs 
we are responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs of the compound 
on november   the company reported results from a pivotal study of co versus gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer  which failed to demonstrate a difference in overall survival between the two study arms 
based on the results of the study  the company has ceased development of co co in may  we entered into a worldwide license agreement with avila now part of celgene corporation to discover  develop and commercialize a covalent inhibitor of mutant forms of the egfr gene product 
co was identified as the lead inhibitor candidate developed by avila under the license agreement 
we are responsible for all preclinical  clinical  regulatory and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize co we made an up front payment of million to avila upon execution of the license agreement and an additional million milestone payment in the first quarter of upon the acceptance by the us food and drug administration  or fda  of our investigational new drug  or ind  application for co we recognized both payments as acquired in process research and development expense 
we are obligated to pay royalties on net sales of co  based on the volume of annual net sales achieved 
celgene has the option to increase royalty rates by electing to reimburse a portion of our development expenses 
this option must be exercised within a limited period of time after celgene is notified by us of our intent to pursue regulatory approval of co in the united states or the european union as a first line treatment 
we may be required to pay up to an additional aggregate of million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory filings  acceptances and approvals are achieved 
in addition  we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are achieved 

table of contents rucaparib in june  we entered into a license agreement with pfizer to acquire exclusive global development and commercialization rights to pfizer s drug candidate pf  also known as rucaparib 
this drug candidate is a small molecule parp inhibitor which we are developing for the treatment of selected solid tumors 
pursuant to the terms of the license agreement  we made an up front payment by issuing pfizer million principal amount of a convertible promissory note due in  which was subsequently converted to common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering 
we are responsible for all development and commercialization costs of rucaparib and  if approved  we will be required to pay pfizer royalties on sales of the product 
in addition  we may be required to pay pfizer up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments if certain development  regulatory and sales milestones are achieved 
in april  the company entered into a license agreement with astrazeneca uk limited to acquire exclusive rights associated with rucaparib under a family of patents and patent applications that claim methods of treating patients with parp inhibitors in certain indications 
the license enables the development and commercialization of rucaparib for the uses claimed by these patents 
pursuant to the terms of the license agreement  the company made an up front payment of  upon execution of the agreement  which was recognized as acquired in process research and development expense 
the company may be required to pay up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments if certain regulatory filings  acceptances and approvals are achieved 
if approved  astrazeneca will also receive royalties on any sales of rucaparib 
drug discovery collaboration agreement in july  the company entered into a drug discovery collaboration agreement with array biopharma inc for the discovery of a novel kit inhibitor targeting resistance mutations for the treatment of gist  a gastrointestinal cancer 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is responsible to fund all costs of the discovery program  as well as costs to develop and commercialize any clinical candidates discovered 
if any clinical candidates are discovered and the company seeks to pursue clinical development of such clinical candidates  the company may be required to pay array up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments if certain development and regulatory objectives and annual net sales targets are achieved 
financial operations overview revenue to date  we have not generated any revenues 
in the future  we may generate revenue from the sales of product candidates that are currently under development 
based on our current development plans  we do not expect to generate significant revenues for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to complete the development of our product candidates and  together with our partners  companion diagnostics or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  will be adversely affected 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and companion diagnostics  which include license fees and milestone payments related to the acquisition of in licensed products  which are reported on our statements of operations as acquired in process research and development  employee related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel and share based compensation expense  expenses incurred under agreements with cros and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies  the cost of acquiring  developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials  costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations  and activities associated with the development of companion diagnostics for our product candidates 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
license fees and milestone payments related to in licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use 
costs for certain development activities  such as clinical trials  are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment  clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors 
research and development activities are central to our business model 
product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of later stage clinical trials 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to expand our clinical and companion diagnostic development activities for our co and rucaparib product candidates and perform drug discovery activities for a novel kit inhibitor targeting resistance mutations for the treatment of gist 

table of contents the following table identifies research and development costs and acquired in process research and development costs on a program specific basis for our product candidates in licensed through december   their companion diagnostics  and the kit inhibitor drug discovery program 
personnel related costs  depreciation and share based compensation are not allocated to specific programs as they are deployed across multiple projects under development and  as such  are separately classified as personnel and other expenses in the table below 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  cumulative from april  inception to december  in thousands co expenses acquired in process r d research and development co total co expenses acquired in process r d research and development co total rucaparib expenses acquired in process r d research and development rucaparib total kit inhibitor expenses acquired in process r d research and development kit inhibitor total personnel and other expenses total general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  business development  legal  investor relations and information technology functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs  communication expenses  corporate insurance  and professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase due to increased personnel expenses to support the growth in research and development activities 
other income and expense other income is comprised of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  gain on the sale of available for sale securities  and a federal grant awarded to us under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program in other expense includes interest expense associated with the convertible notes payable outstanding during in addition  we hold cash balances at financial institutions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to fund research and development activities performed by various third party vendors 
the translation of these currencies into us dollars results in foreign currency gains or losses  depending on the change in value of these currencies against the us dollar 
these gains and losses are included in other income and expense 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
accrued research and development expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to cros in connection with clinical studies  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies  fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities  fees paid to vendors associated with the development of companion diagnostics  and fees paid to vendors related to product manufacturing  development and distribution of clinical supplies 
we base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple cros that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
there may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed  enrollment of patients  number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly 
although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred  our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period 
based on the amount of accrued research and development expenses as of december   if our estimates of our net accrued liabilities are too high or too low by  this could increase or decrease our research and development expenses by approximately  share based compensation described below is the methodology we have utilized in measuring share based compensation expense 
following the consummation of our initial public offering in november  stock option values are determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock 
since our inception in  we applied the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  or asc  accounting for stock based compensation  which we refer to as asc determining the amount of share based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date 
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award 
calculating the fair value of share based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our share option awards 
use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the price volatility of our common stock  the expected term of our stock options  the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield 
because we are a company with a limited operating history  we utilize data from several peer companies to estimate expected stock price volatility and the expected term of our options 
we selected peer companies from the biopharmaceutical industry with similar characteristics as us  including stage of product development  market capitalization  number of employees and therapeutic focus 
we utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions 
table of contents year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  period from april  inception through december  dividend yield volatility risk free interest rate expected term years in accordance with asc  we recognized share based compensation expense of approximately million  million   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  and for the period april  inception through december  as of december   we had million in total unrecognized compensation expense  net of related forfeiture estimates  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately years 
we expect our share based compensation to grow in future periods due to the potential increases in the value of our common stock and headcount 
under asc  we are required to estimate the level of forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest 
due to the lack of historical forfeiture activity of our plan  we estimated our forfeiture rate based on peer company data with characteristics similar to our company 
as there was no public market for our common stock until our initial public offering in november  the estimated fair value of our common stock from april through the initial public offering date effective november  was determined contemporaneously by our board of directors based on valuation estimates provided by management and prepared in accordance with the framework of the aicpa technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity practice aids  or the practice aid 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended in thousands research and development expenses increase from prior year change from prior year 
table of contents the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  over was primarily due to development expenses associated with our rucaparib and co product candidates 
clinical trial and drug development expenses increased by million due to growth in preclinical development  diagnostic development activities and in the number of patients  active sites and investigators participating in the clinical trials that support these two product candidates 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a drug discovery program for kit  resulting in an increase of million over the prior year 
co costs increased by million due mainly to drug development  manufacturing activities  and expenses incurred to wind down this program 
the remaining increase of million was due primarily to an increase in salaries  benefits  stock compensation expense and personnel related costs resulting from additional headcount hired to support the expanding development activities of our products 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  over was due primarily to development expenses associated with co and rucaparib clinical trials 
clinical trial expenses increased by million due to growth in the number of patients  active sites and investigators that were participating in our co clinical trials and costs incurred for the development of companion diagnostics for our co drug product  as well as the assumption of clinical development costs for rucaparib following the in licensing of that product candidate in june drug product development and manufacturing activities also increased by  in support of the co development 
in addition  million of the increase was the result of discovery  formulation development  manufacturing  and the commencement of preclinical activities associated with co  a compound that was in licensed in may the remaining increase of million was due primarily to an increase in salaries  benefits and personnel related costs resulting from additional headcount hired to support the expanding development activities of co  co and rucaparib 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended in thousands general and administrative expenses increase from prior year change from prior year the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  over was primarily attributable to increased personnel  professional services  facilities and information system costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
additionally  share based compensation increased by million due to the increase in the value of stock options granted in the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  over was primarily attributable to a full year s lease expense in associated with office space in san francisco  california and cambridge  england where the leases commenced in may and august  respectively  as well as legal fees associated with patent review and analysis activities for two of our product candidates  and increased personnel  travel and information system costs to support company growth 
additionally  stock compensation expense increased by  relative to the increase in the valuation of our common stock in 
table of contents acquired in process research and development expenses 
acquired in process research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended in thousands acquired in process research and development decrease from prior year change from prior year the decrease in acquired in process research and development expenses for the year ended december  in comparison to was due to a reduction in payments made to partners related to in licensing agreements 
in january  we made a regulatory milestone payment of million to avila therapeutics  inc for the fda s acceptance of our ind application to begin clinical investigation of co in june  we made an up front payment to pfizer to acquire the licensing rights to rucaparib by issuing a million convertible promissory note 
the decrease in acquired in process research and development expenses for the year ended december  over was due to the difference in up front acquisition costs for the development and commercialization rights of rucaparib in comparison to co and co in may  we acquired the global rights to develop and commercialize co and made a million up front payment which was recognized as acquired in process research and development expense 
additionally  in november  we made a payment of million to clavis to expand the territory rights under the license agreement to include asia and other international markets and we recorded this payment as acquired in process research and development expense 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended in thousands other income expense  net increase decrease from prior year change from prior year the decrease in other expense for the year ended december  over was due to the decrease in interest expense and debt issuance costs of  resulting from the conversion of our convertible promissory notes issued in into common stock upon the effective date of our initial public offering in november the increase was partially offset by a reduction to foreign currency transaction gains realized in resulting from a change in the value of euro and british pound transactions in relation to the us dollar 
the decrease in other income expense  net for the year ended december  over was due to interest expense increasing by  resulting from the convertible promissory notes issued to our existing investors and pfizer during the second quarter of  which were subsequently converted to common stock upon the effective date of our initial public offering in november we also recorded  of debt issuance costs in associated with the issuance of convertible promissory notes 
in addition  other expense increased in due to a  award received in under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program that did not occur in  as well as a  reduction in foreign currency transaction gains in due primarily to a change in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through the private placement of equity  convertible debt securities and public offerings of our common stock in november and april as of december  we have received million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock  million through the issuance of convertible promissory notes  and million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest associated with the convertible promissory notes were converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering at the initial public offering price of per share  in november as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 

table of contents the following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the use of cash in all periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non cash charges and changes in components of working capital 
the increase of million to cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  in comparison to prior year was due to the growth in rucaparib and co research and development costs associated with the expansion of clinical trials  drug formulation and manufacturing costs  initiation of the kit drug discovery program in the third quarter of  increased co program expenses related to the closedown of clinical studies and manufacturing development activities upon the discontinuation of the co program in late  and increased internal salaries  benefits and personnel related costs resulting from additional headcount hired to support the expanding development activities of our product candidates 
the increase of million to cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year was due to an increase in clinical trial costs for co resulting from an increase in the number of patients enrolled and sites activated for our ongoing leap trial  commencement of co research and development activities  in licensed by us in may  and commencement of product development and clinical trial activities for rucaparib  in licensed by us in june investing activities the cash provided by used in investing activities for all periods primarily reflects the purchase of available for sale securities offset by maturities and sales of available for sale securities 
the decrease of million in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year was due to a reduction in available for sale security maturities and sales of million and an increase of million for the purchase of property and equipment 
the increase of million in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was due primarily to the maturities and sale of available for sale securities in to fund operations 
the increase related to the sale and maturities of available for sale securities is partially offset by the purchase of million in property and equipment in compared to million in financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects the receipt of million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in april and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was due to the issuance of million of convertible promissory notes for cash in the second quarter of  the receipt of million in net cash proceeds in the fourth quarter of from the sale of common stock during our initial public offering  and the exercise of stock options for million 
operating capital requirements assuming we successfully complete clinical trials and obtain requisite regulatory approvals  we do not anticipate commercializing any of our product candidates until at the earliest 
as such  we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses for the foreseeable future as we incur expenses to complete our development activities for each of our programs  including clinical trial activities  companion diagnostic development  drug development  establishing our commercial capabilities  and expanding our general and administrative functions to support the growth in our research and development and commercial organizations 
the net proceeds raised from the sale of securities to date will not be sufficient to fund our operations through successful development and commercialization of our product candidates 
as a result  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and continue to conduct clinical trials to support additional development and potential regulatory approval  make milestone payments to our licensors and commercialize our product candidates 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next months 
if our available cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or convertible preferred stock  these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
furthermore  any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of our planned development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of our working capital requirements 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the number and characteristics of the product candidates  companion diagnostics  and indications we pursue  the achievement of various development  regulatory and commercial milestones resulting in required payments to partners pursuant to the terms of our license agreements  the scope  progress  results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates and related companion diagnostics and conducting clinical and preclinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates and companion diagnostics  the cost of commercialization activities  if any  assuming our product candidates are approved for sale  including marketing and distribution costs  the cost of manufacturing any of our product candidates we successfully commercialize  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  including litigation costs and outcome of such litigation  and the timing  receipt and amount of sales  if any  of our product candidates 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years operating lease obligations in addition  we have certain obligations under licensing agreements with third parties contingent upon achieving various development  regulatory and commercial milestones 
pursuant to our license agreement for the development and commercialization of co  we may be required to pay an additional aggregate of million if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory approvals are achieved 
further  we may be required to pay an aggregate of up to million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are met for co pursuant to our license agreements for the development of rucaparib  we may be required to pay up to an aggregate million in milestone payments upon the successful attainment of development  regulatory and sales milestones 
pursuant to our drug discovery collaboration agreement for the discovery of a novel kit inhibitor  if any clinical candidates are discovered and we seek to pursue clinical development of such clinical candidates  we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments if certain development and regulatory objectives and annual net sales targets are achieved 
finally  pursuant to terms of each of these license agreements  we will pay royalties to our licensors on sales  if any  of the respective products 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under the rules promulgated by the sec 

table of contents tax loss carryforwards as of december   we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal income taxes 
we also have federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million to offset future federal income taxes 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards expire at various times through we believe that a change in ownership as defined under section of the us internal revenue code occurred as a result of the company s public offering of common stock completed in april future utilization of the federal net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards accumulated from inception to the change in ownership date will be subject to annual limitations to offset future taxable income 
we do not  however  believe this limitation prevents utilization prior to expiration 
at december   we recorded a valuation allowance against our net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  as we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be fully realized 
in the future  if we determine that a portion or all of the tax benefits associated with our tax carryforwards will be realized  net income would increase in the period of determination 
recently adopted accounting standards on january   the company adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
the standard eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
the company elected to present the statement of operations and statement of comprehensive loss in two separate  but consecutive statements 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force and the sec did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the company s present or future financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  consisting of bank demand deposits and money market funds that primarily invest in us government obligations 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal and maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because our investments are in short term securities 
our available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
we contract with cros  investigational sites  and contract manufacturers globally 
we may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements 
while we periodically hold foreign currencies  primarily euro and pound sterling  we do not use other financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risk 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
as of december  and december   approximately and  respectively  of our total liabilities were denominated in currencies other than the functional currency
