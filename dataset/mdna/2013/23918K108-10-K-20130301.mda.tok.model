the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and item business 
davita healthcare partners inc overview with our recent acquisition of hcp on november   we believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on anticipated trends in us healthcare  including our continued growth opportunities in dialysis care services as well as growth in managed healthcare services  especially to the medicare eligible population 
as a result of the acquisition  the company now primarily operates two major lines of business and  to a lesser extent  various other ancillary services and strategic initiatives  which includes our international dialysis operations 
our largest line of business is our us dialysis and related lab services business  which is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the us for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure  also known as esrd 
our other major line of business is hcp  which is a patient and physician focused integrated health care delivery and management company with nearly three decades of providing coordinated  outcomes based medical care in a cost effective manner 
on november  we completed our acquisition of hcp pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated may   whereby hcp became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
hcp is one of the country s largest operators of medical groups and physician networks generating approximately billion in annual revenues and approximately million in operating income for the year ended december  the operating results of hcp are included in our consolidated financial results from november  the total consideration paid at closing for all of the outstanding common units of hcp was approximately billion  which consisted of billion in cash  net of cash acquired  and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately billion 
the total acquisition consideration is subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 
the acquisition agreement also provides that as further consideration  we will pay the common unit holders of hcp a total of up to million in cash if certain performance targets are achieved by hcp in and in conjunction with the acquisition  we amended our credit agreement to allow for additional borrowings of billion and also issued new senior notes for billion  all of which was used to finance the acquisition  pay off a portion of our and hcp s existing debt  and to pay fees and expenses 
our overall financial performance was strong for and was characterized by strong treatment volume growth  primarily from acquisitions and non acquired growth rates and by productivity improvements and cost control initiatives in our dialysis business 
the improvements were primarily the result of decreased operating costs per treatment due to a decline in the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals due to continued evolution of clinical practices and physicians responding to the new fda label for epo 
some of our major accomplishments and financial operating performance indicators in and year over year were as follows superior clinical outcomes we provided our best clinical outcomes for the thirteenth straight year  the acquisition of hcp generated incremental operating income of million in  consolidated net revenue growth of approximately of which is related to our us dialysis operations  an increase of approximately in the overall number of treatments that we provided  normalized non acquired treatment growth of  consolidated operating income growth of approximately  which includes the impact of the legal settlement and related expenses and transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of hcp 
excluding these items adjusted consolidated operating income would have increased by  and strong operating cash flows of  million 
however  we believe that will continue to be challenging as we undertake initiatives to mitigate the planned reduction in our medicare reimbursement rates that are scheduled to take effect on march  as a result of government sequestration and the risks and challenges associated with our entry into our new line of business  as a result of the acquisition of hcp 
in addition  congress could also make significant changes to medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates and  along with the utilization of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical cost may have a significant impact on our operating results 
we also remain committed to our international expansion plans that will continue to require a significant investment in in addition  if the percentage of our dialysis patients with commercial payors continues to deteriorate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
following is a summary of consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows 
the operating results of hcp are included in our operating results effective november  year ended december  dollar amounts rounded to nearest million net revenues total consolidated net revenues add provision for uncollectible accounts consolidated revenues before the provision for uncollectible accounts patient service revenues less provision for uncollectible accounts net patient service revenues hcp capitated revenues other revenues total net consolidated revenues operating expenses and charges patient care costs general and administrative depreciation and amortization provision for uncollectible accounts legal settlement and related expenses equity investment income total operating expenses and charges operating income the following table summarizes consolidated net revenues year ended december  dollar amounts rounded to nearest million net revenues dialysis and related lab services patient service revenues less provision for uncollectible accounts dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenues other revenues total net dialysis and related lab services revenues hcp capitated revenues hcp net patient service revenues less provision for uncollectible accounts of other revenue total net hcp revenues other ancillary services and strategic initiatives revenues other ancillary services and strategic initiatives net patient service revenues total net other ancillary services and strategic initiatives revenues total net segment revenues elimination of intersegment revenues consolidated net revenues the following table summarizes consolidated operating income and adjusted consolidated operating income year ended dollar amounts rounded to nearest million dialysis and related lab services hcp services other ancillary services and strategic initiatives loss total segment operating income reconciling items corporate support costs transaction expenses consolidated operating income reconciliation of non gaap measure add legal settlement and related expenses transaction expenses adjusted consolidated operating income for the year ended december   we have excluded an million legal settlement and related expenses and million of transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of hcp from operating expenses and operating income 
these are non gaap measures and are not intended as substitutes for the gaap equivalent measures 
we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user s understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding an unusual charge of million for a legal settlement and related expenses that resulted from the settlement of the woodard private civil suit see note to the consolidated financial statements and an unusual amount of transaction expenses totaling million that resulted from the acquisition of hcp  and therefore  these adjusted consolidated operating income amounts are meaningful and comparable to our prior period results and indicative of our normal consolidated operating income 
consolidated net revenues consolidated revenues before the provision for uncollectible accounts related to patient service revenues for increased by approximately  million  or approximately  from consolidated net revenues for increased by approximately  million or approximately from this increase in the consolidated net revenues was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately million  principally due to strong volume growth from additional treatments from non acquired growth and dialysis center acquisitions and from an increase of in the average dialysis revenue per treatment  primarily from an increase in our medicare reimbursements  partially offset by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of million 
consolidated net revenues also increased by million as a result of the acquisition of hcp on november  and increased by approximately million associated with the ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our disease management services 
consolidated revenues before the provision for uncollectible accounts related to patient service revenues for increased by approximately million  or approximately  from consolidated net revenues for increased by approximately million or approximately from this increase in consolidated net revenues was primarily due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately million  principally due to strong volume growth from additional treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions including the acquisition of dsi  partially offset by a decline of in the average dialysis revenue per treatment  primarily from a decrease in our medicare revenues as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system and an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of million 
consolidated net revenues also increased as a result of an increase of approximately million in the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and from our disease management services 
consolidated operating income consolidated operating income of  million for increased by approximately million  or  from which includes the million legal settlement and related expenses and the million of transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of hcp 
excluding these items in  adjusted consolidated operating income would have increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase in the dialysis and related lab services net revenues as a result of strong volume growth in revenue from additional treatments as a result of non acquired growth and acquisitions  and from an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately  partially offset by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of million 
adjusted consolidated operating income also increased as a result of the acquisition of hcp on november   an overall decline in pharmaceutical costs mainly from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  lower transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of dsi that occurred in and from productivity improvements 
however  consolidated operating income was negatively impacted by an increase in the unit cost of epo  higher labor and benefit costs  an increase in our professional fees for compliance and legal initiatives  and for information technology matters and an increase in expenses and operating losses associated with our international expansion 
consolidated operating income of  million for increased by approximately million  or  from the increase in consolidated operating income in was primarily due to an increase in the dialysis and related lab services net revenues as a result of strong volume growth in revenue from additional treatments as a result of non acquired growth and acquisitions  partially offset by a decline in our average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately and an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of million 
consolidated operating income also increased as a result of overall lower pharmaceutical costs mainly from a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  additional operating income from the acquisition of dsi and from cost control initiatives

us dialysis and related lab services business our us dialysis and related lab service businesses is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services through a network of  outpatient dialysis centers throughout states and district of columbia  serving a total of approximately  patients 
we also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately hospitals 
we estimate that we have approximately a market share in the us based upon the number of patients that we serve 
in  our overall network of us outpatient dialysis centers increased by centers primarily as a result of acquisitions of dialysis centers and from opening new dialysis centers 
in addition  the overall number of patients that we serve in the us increased by approximately as compared to all references in this document to dialysis and related lab services refer only to our us dialysis and related lab services business 
our dialysis and related lab services stated mission is to be the provider  partner and employer of choice 
we believe our attention to these three stakeholders our patients  our business partners  and our teammates represents the major driver of our long term performance  although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns 
accordingly  two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover 
we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes  which we refer to as the davita quality index dqi 
our clinical outcomes as measured by dqi have improved over each of the past several years which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities 
although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry  we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the us and generally exceed the dialysis outcome quality indicators of the national kidney foundation 
in addition  over the past several years our teammate turnover has remained relatively constant  which we believe was a major contributor to our continued clinical performance improvements and also a major driver of our ability to maintain or improve clinical hours per treatment 
we will continue to focus on these stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long term value drivers 
our national scale and size  among other things  allows us to provide industry leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients and referring physicians  as well as qualified medical directors  provides our dialysis patient base with a large number of out patient dialysis centers to choose from with convenient locations and access to a full range of services and provides us the ability to effectively and efficiently manage certain costs while maintaining strong legal and compliance programs 
approximately of our consolidated net revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business 
approximately of our dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the  us centers that we consolidate 
on a pro forma basis  our dialysis and related lab services business net revenues for fiscal would have represented approximately of our consolidated net revenues assuming hcp was acquired on january  other dialysis services  which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations  are peritoneal dialysis  home based hemodialysis  hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services 
these services collectively accounted for the balance of our dialysis and related lab services revenues 
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are the number of treatments  which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week  as well as  to a lesser extent  the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services  and average dialysis revenue per treatment 
the total patient base is a relatively stable factor  which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services as indicated by the united states renal data system that reported an approximate compound growth rate of over the last several years for the dialysis patient population  our relationships with referring physicians  together with the quality of our clinical care which can lead to reduced patient mortality rates  and our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers 
in  we were able to increase our overall network of patients that we serviced in the us by approximately as compared to our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment in was primarily driven by our mix of commercial and government principally medicare and medicaid patients  commercial and government payment rates  our billing and collecting operations performance  and to a lesser extent the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable since payment for these pharmaceuticals are included in medicare s single bundled payment rate system and can also be included as part of a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided under some of our commercial contracts that cover certain patients 
on average  dialysis related payment rates from commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare  medicaid and other government program payment rates  and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment 
the percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out of network providers continued to increase and can also significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment since commercial payment rates for patients with out of network providers are on average higher than in network payment rates 
in  the growth of our government based patients continued to outpace the growth of our commercial patients  which has been a trend that we have experienced for the past several years 
we believe the growth in our government based patients is driven primarily by improved mortality and the current economic environment that has resulted in a decrease in the number of individuals that are covered under commercial insurance plans 
this trend has negatively impacted our average dialysis revenue per treatment over the last several years as a result of receiving a larger proportion of our revenue from government based payors  such as medicare  that reimburse us at lower payment rates 
the following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december  revenues medicare and medicare assigned plans medicaid and medicaid assigned plans other government based programs total government based programs commercial including hospital dialysis services total dialysis and related lab services revenues government dialysis related payment rates in the us are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy 
for patients with medicare coverage  all esrd payments for dialysis treatments and related lab services are made under a bundled payment rate which provides a fixed rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment  including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed to the dialysis providers  such as epo  vitamin d analogs and iron supplements  as well as laboratory testing 
the initial bundled rate included reductions of from the prior reimbursement and further reduced overall rates by 
these reductions were tied to an expanded list of case mix adjustors which can be earned back based upon the presence of certain patient characteristics and co morbidities at the time of treatment 
there are also other provisions which may impact payment including an outlier pool and a low volume facility adjustment 
another important provision in the law is an annual adjustment  or market basket update  to the base esrd pps 
absent action by congress the pps base rate will be automatically updated by a formulaic inflation adjustment 
on november   cms issued the final esrd pps rule for  which increased the base rate by  representing a market basket of increase of less a productivity adjustment of 
on november   cms issued the final esrd pps rule for the base rate will increase by  resulting from a market basket increase of less a productivity adjustment of 
this increase in the esrd pps base rate is to be reduced by the budget control act of sequestration  discussed below 
the final rule implements the reduction in bad debt payments to dialysis facilities as well as to all other providers eligible for bad debt payments mandated under the middle class tax extension and job creation act of and adds new quality reporting measures 
the new payment system presents operating  clinical and financial risks 
for example  with regard to the expanded list of case mix adjustors  there is a risk that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate patient specific characteristics  resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive 
on december   the us general accountability office gao released a letter report entitled end stage renal disease reduction in drug utilization suggests bundled payment is too high 
the gao found esrd drug utilization in was about lower  on average  than it was in this was primarily the result of a decline in epo usage 
the gao concluded the bundled payment rate was excessive given the changes in esrd drug utilization 
because the department of health and human services hhs claimed it did not have authority to rebase the bundled payment rate  gao recommended congress should require the secretary of hhs to take such action 
subsequently  on january   congress passed the american taxpayer relief act of atra which includes a provision that incorporates the gao s recommendations 
the atra directs cms to compare the utilization of drugs and biologicals epo and other former composite drugs from before the esrd pps to the utilization after the implementation of the esrd pps in and adjust the esrd pps rate to account for reductions in utilization of these drugs 
the adjustment also must account for the most current data on average sales prices and changes in prices for drugs reflected in the esrd market basket percentage increase 
the adjustment would apply to services furnished on or after january  the congressional budget office cbo projected budget savings of billion over ten years 
in addition  gao is required to produce an updated report no later than december  as a result of the budget control act of and subsequent activity in congress  the federal government is faced with a trillion sequester across the board spending cuts in discretionary programs 
in particular  medicare providers face a maximum of a reduction in reimbursements in fiscal year under the american taxpayer relief act of  the sequester was postponed until march  should congress fail to act by that date  the sequestration will take effect 
the across the board cuts pursuant to the sequester would have an adverse affect on our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
in addition  under the original esrd pps statute and regulations  beginning january   certain oral only esrd drugs currently paid separately to pharmacies under medicare part d would have been included in the esrd bundled payment to dialysis facilities 
under the american taxpayer relief act of  the inclusion of oral only medications in the bundled rate will be delayed until january  the act also requires cms to monitor the bone and mineral metabolism of esrd patients along with the case mix adjustments made under the esrd pps 
inadequate pricing could have a significant negative financial impact on our dialysis facilities given the volume and value of these drugs 
we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation  such as labor and supply costs  regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system 
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure 
our commercial payment rates also include payments for out of network patients that on average are higher than our in network contract rates 
in  we were successful in increasing some of our commercial payment rates which contributed to an increase in our average dialysis revenue per treatment 
in  we continued to enter into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients 
we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors  and payors are aggressive in their negotiations 
if our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases  this would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  if there is an increase in job losses in the us as a result of current economic conditions  or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system  we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial plans 
approximately of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december   were from physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are separately billable  with epo accounting for approximately of our dialysis and related lab services revenues 
the impact of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals on our overall revenues that are separately billable in and has significantly decreased from prior years primarily as a result of medicare s single bundled payment system  as well as some additional commercial contracts that pay us a single bundled payment rate 
our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we realize 
over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and internal processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes 
in  we continued to upgrade our information technology systems and implemented process changes 
we will continue to upgrade our systems and modify our processes in to improve our ability to capture the necessary patient characteristics  co morbidities and certain other factors under medicare s bundled payment system 
we believe this will potentially enable us to capture additional reimbursement amounts from medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance 
however  as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes  or as payors change their systems and requirements  we could experience a negative impact to our cash collection performance which would affect our dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment 
our dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks 
our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience 
changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
in  the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately per treatment primarily due to an increase in our medicare reimbursements and an increase in some of our commercial payment rates  partially offset by a decline in the commercial payor mix  and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals 
in  the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment decreased by approximately per treatment primarily due to a decline in our medicare reimbursements as a result of operating in the new single bundled payment system  a decline in the commercial payor mix  and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  partially offset by an increase in some of our commercial payment rates 
our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors  including our commercial payment rates  government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments and pharmaceuticals under medicare s bundled payment rate system  including our ability to capture certain patient characteristics  changes in the mix of government and commercial patients  and changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals that are billed separately 
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment  labor rates  vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals  utilization levels of pharmaceuticals  business infrastructure costs  which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers  and legal and compliance costs 
however  other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability  such as employee benefit costs and insurance costs 
our average clinical hours per treatment in decreased compared to  which was the result of improved process efficiencies primarily from an experienced steady workforce and continued investment in training in our internal procedures and practices 
we are always striving for improved productivity levels  however  changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements  which can lead to increased labor costs in order to implement these new requirements  can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels 
in addition  improvements in the us economy could stimulate additional competition for skilled clinical personnel and result in higher teammate turnover which would adversely affect productivity levels 
in and  we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately in both years  as clinical labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends  mainly due to the demand for skilled clinical personnel  along with general inflation increases 
however  in  we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to manage our overall operating costs  including labor rates 
in  we experienced an increase in our overall epo unit costs 
in december  we entered into an amendment to our agreement with amgen that makes non material changes to certain terms of the agreement for the period from january  through december  under the terms of the original agreement before the amendment  we were required to purchase epo in amounts necessary to meet no less than of our requirements of esas and are still required to do so after in addition  all of the other conditions as specified in the original agreement entered into in november still apply 
in  we also experienced increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers  primarily due to the number of new dialysis centers opened  and general increases in rent  utilities and repairs and maintenance 
our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses represented of our dialysis and related lab services net revenues in as compared to in this continues to represent a fairly significant increase in the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses that we have experienced over the last several years  primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business  improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes  responding to certain legal and compliance matters  and professional fees associated with information technology matters 
we expect that these levels of expenditures on our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in will continue and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry and continue to invest in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters

the following table summarizes our dialysis and related lab services revenues by modality for the year ended december  revenue percentages outpatient hemodialysis centers peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis hospital inpatient hemodialysis total dialysis and related lab services revenues approximately of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december  were from government based programs  principally medicare  medicaid  and medicare assigned plans  representing approximately of our total patients 
over the last several years  we have been experiencing growth in our government based patients that has been outpacing the growth in our commercial patients which has negatively impacted our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment 
our overall percentage of patients and revenues associated with commercial payors continued to decline in as compared to less than of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients 
no single commercial payor associated with our dialysis and related lab services business accounted for more than of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december  on average we are paid significantly more for services provided to patients covered by commercial insurance plans in the us than we are for patients covered by medicare  medicaid or other government plans such as medicare assigned plans 
patients covered by commercial health plans transition to medicare coverage after a maximum of months 
as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to medicare or medicaid coverage  the payment rates normally decline substantially 
medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis treatments  and therefore we lose money on each medicare treatment 
nearly all of our net earnings from our dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors  some of which pay at established contract rates and others which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out of network patients  which are typically higher than contracted rates 
if we experience a net overall reduction in our contracted and non contracted commercial rates as a result of these negotiations or restrictions  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
operating expenses and charges patient care costs 
dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor  pharmaceuticals  medical supplies and operating costs of the dialysis centers 
the dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the per treatment costs in as compared to was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and productivity improvements  partially offset by higher labor costs  and higher epo unit costs 
the dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the per treatment costs in as compared to was primarily attributable to a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals and continued cost control initiatives  partially offset by higher labor and benefit costs  and higher epo unit costs 
general and administrative expenses 
dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in increased by approximately million as compared to the increase was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs  an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance initiatives and for information technology matters  partially offset by a decline in the transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of dsi that occurred in the third quarter of general and administrative expenses in increased by approximately million as compared to primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs  an increase in our professional expenses for legal and compliance initiatives and for information technology matters as well as transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of dsi 
depreciation and amortization 
dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for increased by approximately million as compared to and increased by million in as compared to the increases were primarily due to growth through new dialysis center developments and acquisitions 
the increase in was also due to additional depreciation associated with the opening of our new corporate headquarters in august provision for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for us dialysis and related lab services was for  for  and for the increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable in was primarily due to an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts to due to higher non covered medicare charges that resulted in additional write offs in the fourth quarter of we currently expect this level of the provision for uncollectible accounts to continue into  although it may increase if we encounter collection issues as a result of sustained weakness in the us economy 
legal settlement and related expenses 
we reached an agreement to settle all allegations relating to claims arising out of the previously disclosed litigation filed in in the us district court in the eastern district of texas 
in connection with this settlement we incurred costs and expenses of million in that consisted of million for the settlement plus attorney fees and other related expenses 
the settlement resolved federal program claims regarding epo that were or could have been raised in the complaint relating to historical epo practices dating back to see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
equity investment income 
equity investment income was approximately million in as compared to million in and million in the increase in equity investment income in as compared to was primarily due to the profitability of certain of our dialysis nonconsolidated joint ventures 
equity investment income in as compared to was flat  but was impacted by an increase in the profitability of certain of our nonconsolidated joint ventures  offset by a decrease in the operating performance of certain other joint ventures 
dialysis operating income dialysis and related lab services operating income for increased by approximately million as compared to including the legal settlement and related expenses of million  as discussed above 
excluding this item from  dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income would have increased by million 
the increase in the adjusted operating income for as compared to was primarily due to strong treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments from non acquired growth and acquisitions of dialysis centers  and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately as described above  partially offset by an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts of million 
the dialysis and related lab services operating income also increased as a result of a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  productivity improvements and lower transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of dsi that occurred in however  the dialysis and related lab services operating income was negatively impacted by an increase in the unit cost of epo  higher labor and benefit costs  payroll taxes  an increase in our professional fees in conjunction with compliance and legal initiatives and for information technology matters

hcp business hcp is a patient and physician focused  integrated health care delivery and management company with nearly three decades of providing coordinated  outcomes based medical care in a cost effective manner 
through capitation contracts with some of the nation s leading health plans  as of december   hcp had approximately  current members under its care in southern california  central and south florida and southern nevada 
of these  approximately  individuals were patients enrolled in medicare advantage 
the remaining approximately  individuals were managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employer or who have individually acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for medicaid benefits 
additionally  hcp operates in its new mexico market under a fee for service reimbursement structure 
in addition to its managed care business  during the year ended december   hcp provided care in all markets to over  patients whose health coverage is structured on a fee for service basis  including patients enrolled through traditional medicare and medicaid programs  preferred provider organizations and other third party payors 
the patients of hcp s associated physicians  physician groups and ipas benefit from an integrated approach to medical care that places the physician at the center of patient care 
as of december   hcp delivered services to its members via a network of over  associated groups and other network primary care physicians  network hospitals  and several thousand associated group and network specialists 
together with hundreds of case managers  registered nurses and other care coordinators  these medical professionals utilize a comprehensive data analysis engine  sophisticated risk management techniques and clinical protocols to provide high quality  cost effective care to hcp s members 
the total amount of revenue from hcp for the year ended december   which includes two months of operations  was approximately million  or approximately of our consolidated net revenues 
key financial measures and indicators operating revenues general 
hcp s consolidated revenues consist primarily of i hcp capitated revenues  including revenues attributable to capitation arrangements contracts with health plans and  to a lesser extent  revenues from patient services arrangements and ii other operating revenues  each as described in more detail below 
on a pro forma basis  hcp s business net revenues for fiscal would have represented approximately of our consolidated net revenues assuming hcp was acquired on january  hcp revenues 
hcp capitated revenues consist primarily of fees for medical services provided under capitated contracts with various health plans or under fee for service arrangements with privately insured individuals 
capitation revenue derived from health plans typically results from either i premium payments by cms to hcp s health plan customers under medicare advantage with respect to seniors  disabled and other eligible persons which are referred to herein as hcp s senior membership  ii premium payments by state governments to hcp s health plan customers under medicaid managed care programs which are referred to herein as hcp s medicaid membership  and iii premium payments from public and private employers and individuals to hcp s health plan customers with respect to their employees which are referred to herein as hcp s commercial membership 
capitation payments under health plan contracts are made monthly based on the number of enrollees selecting an hcp associated group physician employed or associated with one of hcp s medical group entities as their primary health care provider 
the amount of monthly capitation hcp receives from health plans on behalf of a member generally does not vary during a given calendar year  regardless of the level of actual medical services utilized by the member 
due to differing state laws affecting health care entities  hcp s capitation contracts fall into two general categories 
as described in more detail below  in central florida and southern nevada  hcp utilizes a global capitation model in which it assumes the financial responsibility for both professional physician and institutional or hospital services for covered benefits 
in southern california  hcp utilizes variants of a different model for capitation under which it is directly financially responsible for covered professional services  but indirectly financially responsible for covered institutional expenses 
hcp s associated medical groups also receive specified incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria 
these amounts are accrued when earned  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
global capitation model 
hcp records the aggregate global capitation pmpm fee as revenue and the amounts paid with respect to claims as medical expenses or hospital expenses  as applicable  in its combined financial statements see operating expenses medical expenses and operating expenses hospital expenses below 
revenue with respect to both professional and institutional capitation is recorded in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive health care 
in hcp s central florida market  hcp also receives capitation revenue and is liable for corresponding expenses for prescription drug activity rendered on behalf of hcp s senior members through the part d component under the medicare advantage program 
risk sharing model 
as compensation under its various managed care related administrative services agreements with hospitals  hcp is entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses  and any such risk share amount to which hcp is entitled is recorded as medical revenues 
in addition  pursuant to such managed care related administrative services agreements  hcp agrees to be responsible should the third party incur institutional expenses in excess of institutional capitation revenue 
as with global capitation  revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive health care 
risk share revenues that is  the portion of the excess or deficit of institutional capitation revenue to which hcp is entitled less institutional expenses  in contrast  are based on the number of enrollees and estimates of institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees  and the amounts accrued when earned can be reasonably estimated 
differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement 
retroactive revenue adjustments 
the medicare advantage revenue received by hcp s health plan customers is adjusted periodically to give effect to the relative clinical and demographic profile of the members for whom hcp is financially responsible 
the model employed by cms bases a portion of the total reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic risk factors  including hospital inpatient diagnoses  additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings  hospital outpatient department and physician visits  gender  age and medicaid eligibility 
under this methodology  health plans must capture  collect and submit diagnosis code information to cms 
capitation payments under this methodology are paid at interim rates during the year and retroactive adjustments occur in subsequent periods generally in the third quarter of the same year  with a final adjustment in the third quarter of the following year after the data is compiled by cms 
hcp estimates the amount of such adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjusts its estimates during the third quarter  upon receipt of payments from cms 
differences between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement 
to date  all such adjustments have resulted in increases in revenue 
patient service revenues 
patient service revenues are recorded when the services are provided 
such revenues are based on a negotiated fixed fee schedule with the applicable health plan 
other operating revenues 
in addition to the revenues discussed above  other operating revenues primarily represents i payments received from payors not directly related to patient care  ii revenues received by the camden group  a medical consulting firm and hcp s wholly owned subsidiary  and iii management fees hcp receives with respect to its role as the manager of magan medical group magan jv or magan an unconsolidated joint venture with magan medical clinic  inc  located in southern california  in which hcpamg owns a interest 
patient care costs general 
hcp s largest patient care costs are the costs of medical services provided pursuant to its capitation contracts  which consist of medical expenses  hospital expenses and clinical support and other operating costs  as further described below 
under both the global capitation and the risk share capitation models  costs of medical services are recognized in the month in which the related services are provided 
in addition  medical expenses and hospital expenses include an estimate of such expenses that have been incurred but not yet reported 
for further information on how hcp estimates such claims  see critical accounting policies and estimates medical claims liability and related payable  medical expense and hospital expense below 
medical expenses 
medical expenses consist of payments for professional and ancillary services to independent primary care physicians  specialists  ancillary providers and hospitals including  with respect to hospitals  for outpatient services pursuant to agreements with those entities 
the structure of such expenses can consist of  among other things  sub capitation and fee for service payments 
in addition  medical expenses include compensation and related expenses incurred with respect to hcp s associated group primary care physicians and specialists  registered nurses  physician assistants and hospitalists 
hospital expenses 
hospital expenses consist of payments for institutional services to contracted and non contracted hospitals for both inpatient and outpatient services  skilled nursing facilities  and to other institutional providers 
hospital expenses are only incurred in connection with the services hcp provides in central florida and southern nevada 
in those regions  as described above  hcp enters into contracts with health plans pursuant to which it assumes the risk for institutional hospital services 
in california  in contrast  hcp s medical groups are not permitted to contract with health plans to directly assume the risk for institutional services 
accordingly  the risk share revenue that hcp records in california is net of reported claims and estimates of hospital utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees  and no portion of institutional hospital costs incurred with respect to hcp s california operations is included in hospital expenses as presented 
clinic support and other operating costs 
clinic support and other operating costs primarily consist of the costs incurred with respect to compensation of administrative and other support staff employed at hcp s medical clinics  clinic rent and utilities  medical supplies and other direct costs incurred to support clinic operations 
also included in clinic support costs are direct costs incurred to support the camden group 
other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses are those costs directly related to corporate administrative functions in supporting hcp and consist primarily of salaries and benefits  professional fees and occupancy costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses primarily relates to the depreciation and amortization of the fair values of property and equipment and intangible assets as remeasured in connection with the acquisition of hcp 
equity investment income 
as discussed above  hcpamg is a owner of the magan jv with magan medical clinic  inc in addition  hcp also owns a ownership interest in cmgi 
we account for these equity interests under the equity method of accounting  meaning that its assets and liabilities are not consolidated with ours  but we record our pro rata share of the entities earnings as equity investment income

other items hcp s share of equity investment income from our joint venture relationship and our investment in cmgi was million for the period november  through december  and were impacted by an increase in membership during that period and an increase in profitability in cmgi 
other ancillary services and strategic initiatives business our other operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients 
as of december  these consisted primarily of pharmacy services  infusion therapy services  disease management services  vascular access services  esrd clinical research programs  physician services  direct primary care and our international dialysis operations 
see divestiture of homechoice partners  inc for a description of the divestiture of our infusion therapy business that occurred on february  results for this divested infusion therapy business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the remaining ancillary services and strategic initiatives generated approximately million of net revenues in  representing approximately of our consolidated net revenues 
on a pro forma basis our ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for fiscal would have represented approximately of our consolidated net revenues assuming hcp was acquired on january  we currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives including our continued expansion into certain international markets as we work to develop successful new business operations in the us as well as outside the us however  any significant change in market conditions  business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives 
any unfavorable changes in these strategic initiatives could result in a write off or an impairment of some or all of our investments  including goodwill  which occurred in when we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge relating to our infusion therapy business  and could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business 
as of december   we provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of outpatient dialysis centers located in eight countries outside of the us our international dialysis operations are still currently in a start up phase in which we primarily commenced operations during the fourth quarter of the total net revenues generated from our international operations  as reflected below  were not material during the following table reflects the results of operations for the ancillary services and strategic initiatives year ended dollar amounts rounded to nearest in million us revenues net patient service revenues other revenues total international revenues net patient service revenues other revenues total total net revenues segment operating loss net revenues the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for increased by approximately million or as compared to  primarily from growth in pharmacy services  and from our special needs plan 
the ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for increased by approximately million or as compared to  primarily from growth in pharmacy services  and from our special needs plan 
operating expenses ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for increased by approximately million from this increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business  an increase in our claims expenses associated with our special needs plan  an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and an increase in labor and benefit costs 
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for increased by approximately million from this increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in volume in our pharmacy business  an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and an increase in labor and benefit costs 
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating loss ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for increased by approximately million from this increase in operating losses was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion and a decline in the operating performance of our special needs plan  esrd clinical research and our direct primary care  partially offset by an increase in the operating performance of our pharmacy business 
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for increased by approximately million from this increase in operating losses was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion  partially offset by an increase in the operating performance of our pharmacy business and in our vascular access services 
corporate level charges debt expense 
debt expense for   and consisted of interest expense of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  and the amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums and the amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in as compared to was primarily related to the issuance of our new term loans for  million under our amended senior secured credit facilities that we entered into in the fourth quarter of and the issuance of our new senior notes for  million on august  however  debt expense in benefited from lower rates and lower average outstanding balances associated with our term loan a which was paid off on november  and with our term loan b 
our overall weighted average effective interest rate in was as compared to in the increase in interest expense in as compared to was primarily related to additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities that were issued in the fourth quarter of and additional borrowings associated with the new term loan a that contain significantly higher interest rates than our previous facility 
in addition  debt expense in was also impacted by the amount of interest rate swaps that resulted in a higher overall weighted average effective interest rate on the term loan a and from the amortization of an interest rate cap premium associated with our term loan b 
however  debt expense in benefited from lower rates and lower outstanding balances associated with our new senior notes that were issued in the fourth quarter of our overall weighted average effective interest rate in was as compared to in corporate support costs 
corporate support consists primarily of labor  benefits and stock based compensation costs for departments which provide support to all of our operating lines of business and were approximately million in  million in and million in these expenses are included in our consolidated general and administrative expenses 
the increases in these costs in and were primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs 
transaction expenses 
in  we incurred approximately million of transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of hcp  which are included in our consolidated general and administrative expenses 
other income 
other income was approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively  and consisted principally of interest income 
other income in increased from  primarily as a result of higher average cash balances 
other income in was slightly down from  primarily as a result of lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for represented an effective annualized tax rate of  compared with and of income from continuing operations in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was higher primarily due to non deductible transaction costs associated with the acquisition of hcp and international acquisition costs 
impairments and valuation adjustments 
we perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment  amortizable intangible assets  equity investments in non consolidated businesses  and our investments in ancillary services and strategic initiatives at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that an impairment review is warranted 
such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans  the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners  or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance 
goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies 
these types of adjustments are charged directly to the corresponding operating segment that incurred the charge 
there were no other significant impairments or valuation adjustments recognized during noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in noncontrolling interests in and were primarily due to increases in the number of new joint ventures and increases in the profitability of our dialysis related joint ventures 
the percentage of us dialysis and related lab services net revenues generated from dialysis related joint ventures was approximately in and in accounts receivable our us dialysis and related lab services accounts receivable balances at december  and represented approximately days of revenue for and days of revenue for  net of bad debt allowance 
our days outstanding in  represent solid improved cash collections from accounts that are under six months old that enabled us to keep pace with our growth in revenue 
as of december  and  our dialysis and related lab services unreserved accounts receivable balances that were more than six months old were approximately million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of our dialysis accounts receivable balances  respectively 
during  we experienced a slow down in cash collections from certain non government payors 
there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old 
less than of our revenues are classified as patient pay 
substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors  as discussed above 
amounts pending approval from third party payors as of december  and  other than the standard monthly billing  consisted of approximately million in and million in  associated with medicare bad debt claims  classified as other receivables 
currently  a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims 
however  the payment received from medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits 
such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed 
as a kidney dialysis provider  our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements  except for potentially limiting the collectability of these medicare bad debt claims 
liquidity and capital resources available liquidity 
as of december   our cash balance was million and we had an undrawn revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was committed for outstanding letters of credit 
in addition  we had an undrawn revolving line of credit of approximately million of which million was committed for outstanding letter of credit related to hcp 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity  operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings 
cash flow from operations during amounted to  million  compared with  million for the decrease in our operating cash flows in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in income tax payments and the timing of other working capital items  partially offset by an increase in our cash collections from accounts that are less than six months old 
cash flow from operations in included cash interest payments of approximately million and cash tax payments of million 
cash flow from operations in included cash interest payments of approximately million and cash tax payments of million 
non operating cash outflows in included million for capital asset expenditures  including million for new center developments and relocations  and million for maintenance and information technology 
we also spent an additional  million for acquisitions 
during  we also received million from the maturity and sale of investments 
however  some of these proceeds were either used to repurchase other investments or was used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans 
in addition  during  we received million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits 
we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of million  and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in non operating cash outflows in included million for capital asset expenditures  including million for new center developments and relocations  and million for maintenance and information technology 
we also spent an additional  million for acquisitions 
during  we also received million from the maturity and sale of investments 
however  the majority of these proceeds was either used to repurchase other investments or was used to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans 
in addition  during  we received million associated with stock option exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits 
we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of million  and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions 
in addition  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
during  we acquired a total of us dialysis centers nine of which were previously under management and administrative services agreements  opened new us dialysis centers  sold one center  merged nine centers and added one center in which we own a minority equity interest 
in addition  we acquired dialysis centers  opened nine new dialysis centers and also added three dialysis centers under management and administrative service agreements all of which are located outside of the us during  we acquired a total of dialysis centers  eight of which were located outside of the us  opened new dialysis centers  sold two centers  merged seven centers  and divested a total of dialysis centers in connection with the acquisition of dsi 
we also added three dialysis centers under management and administrative service agreements that are located outside of the us and added one center in which we own a minority equity interest 
during the year  we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling million on the term loan a  million on the term loan a prior to the term loan a being fully paid off and million on the term loan b 
as of december   we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling million 
these agreements had the economic effect of modifying the libor variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our term loan a to fixed rates ranging from to  resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of  including the term loan a margin of 
the swap agreements expire by september  and require monthly interest payments 
during the year ended december   we accrued net charges of million from these swaps which are included in debt expense 
as of december   the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of million 
we estimate that approximately million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at december  will be reclassified into income in as of december   we maintained five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling  million 
these agreements have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of on an equivalent amount of our term loan b debt 
the cap agreements expire on september  as of december   the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of million 
during the year ended december   we recorded million  net of tax  as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements 
as a result of the embedded libor floors in some of our debt agreements and the swap and cap agreements  our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was  based upon the current margins in effect of for both the term loan a and for the term loan a and for both the term loan b and for the term loan b  as of december  as of december   interest rates on our term loan b and term loan b debt are effectively fixed because of an embedded libor floor which is higher than actual libor as of such date 
furthermore  the interest rate on the  million of our term loan b is subject to interest rate caps if libor should rise above 
interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms 
the libor variable component of our interest rate on our term loan a is economically fixed as a result of interest rate swaps and the term loan a is based upon libor plus an interest rate margin 
our overall weighted average effective interest rate during was and as of december  was 
as of december   we had undrawn revolving line of credit totaling million of which approximately million was committed for outstanding letters of credit 
acquisition of hcp on november  we completed our acquisition of hcp pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated may   whereby hcp became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
hcp is one of the country s largest operators of medical groups and physician networks generating approximately billion in annual revenues and approximately million in operating income for the year ended december  the operating results of hcp are included in our consolidated financial results from november  the total consideration paid at closing for all of the outstanding common units of hcp was approximately billion  which consisted of billion in cash  net of cash acquired  and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately billion 
the total acquisition consideration is subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 
the acquisition agreement also provides that as further consideration  we will pay the common unit holders of hcp a total of up to million in cash if certain performance targets are achieved by hcp in and capital structure changes and other items in conjunction with the acquisition of hcp  on november   we borrowed an additional  million under an amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement consists of a new five year term loan a facility in an aggregate principal amount of  million and a new seven year term loan b facility in an aggregate principal amount of  million 
the new term loan a initially bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of subject to adjustment depending upon our leverage ratio and can range from to 
this new term loan a requires annual principal payments of million in and  million in  and million in with the balance due of million in the term loan b bears interest at libor floor at plus an interest rate margin of 
the term loan b requires annual principal pay outs of million in through with the balance of  million due in the new borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our guarantors assets 
in addition  we also amended certain financial covenants and various other provisions to provide operating and financial flexibility 
however  the amended credit agreement still contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions on investments  acquisitions  the payment of dividends  redemptions and acquisitions of capital stock  capital expenditures and other indebtedness  as well as limitations on the amount of tangible net assets in non guarantor subsidiaries 
many of these restrictions will not apply as long our leverage ratio is below 
in addition  the credit agreement requires compliance with financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio that determines the interest rate margins as described above 
on august   we also issued  million of new senior notes 
the new senior notes will pay interest on february and august of each year  beginning february  the new senior notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally to other unsecured senior indebtedness 
the new senior notes are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the company 
we may redeem some or all of the new senior notes at any time on or after august  at certain redemption prices and prior to such date at a make whole redemption price 
we may also redeem up to of the new senior notes at any time prior to august  at certain redemption prices with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings 
we received total proceeds of  million from these additional borrowings   million from the borrowings on the new term loan a and new term loan b  and an additional  million from the new senior notes 
we used a portion of the proceeds to finance the acquisition of hcp  pay off the existing term loan a outstanding principal balance and to pay off a portion of hcp s existing debt as well as to pay fees and expenses of approximately million 
divestiture of homechoice partners  inc on february   we completed the sale of homechoice partners inc homechoice to bioscrip  inc pursuant to a stock purchase agreement the agreement dated december  for million in cash  subject to various post closing adjustments of which we will receive approximately of the proceeds 
the agreement also provides that as additional consideration we can earn up to a total of of million if certain performance amounts exceed certain thresholds over the next two years 
homechoice is a regional provider of home infusion services that provides specialized pharmacy nursing and nutritional services to patients in their homes 
homechoice generated approximately million in revenues for the year ended december  the asset and liabilities associated with homechoice are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet and are included in other current assets and other liabilities  respectively 
the operating results for homechoice have been reported in income from operations of discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented 
goodwill impairment in  we determined that circumstances indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of one of our ancillary businesses  homechoice  was less than its carrying amount 
the primary factor in forming our conclusion was the recent decline in the operating performance of the business caused mainly by rapid expansion 
this led management to revise its view of the businesses organizational growth capability and scale back significantly its current plans for future growth initiatives and to update the homechoice forecasts and current operating budgets accordingly 
these revisions reflected the current and expected future cash flows that we believed market participants would use in determining the fair value homechoice 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we estimated that the carrying amount of goodwill related to this business exceeded its implied fair value by million  resulting in a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of that amount 
this amount is included as a component of income from operations of discontinued operations 
as of december   after giving effect to this impairment charge  we had approximately million of goodwill remaining related to this business 
stock based compensation awards stock based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares  or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash 
the value of stock based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight line basis over the vesting terms of the awards  adjusted for expected forfeitures 
during  we granted  stock settled stock appreciation rights with a grant date fair value of million and a weighted average expected life of approximately years   stock units with a grant date fair value of million and a weighted average expected life of approximately years  and cash settled stock based awards on  shares with a fair value at december  of million 
long term incentive compensation for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in long term incentive compensation costs 
long term incentive program ltip compensation includes both stock based compensation principally stock settled stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units as well as long term performance based cash awards 
long term incentive compensation expense  which was primarily general and administrative in nature  was allocated among the dialysis and related lab services business  corporate support costs  and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives 
as of december  there was million in total estimated but unrecognized long term incentive compensation for ltip awards outstanding  including million for nonvested stock based awards under our equity compensation and stock purchase plans 
we expect to recognize the performance based cash component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of years  and the stock based component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of years 
during the years ended december  and  we received million and million  respectively  in cash proceeds from legacy stock option exercises and million and million  respectively  in total actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards 
acquisition on september   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of cdsi i holding company  inc  the parent company of dialysis provider dsi pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger for approximately million in net cash  plus the assumption of certain liabilities totaling approximately million  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
dsi had outpatient dialysis centers that provided services to approximately  patients in states 
we also incurred approximately million in transaction and integration costs during the year ended december  associated with this acquisition that are included in general and administrative expenses 
pursuant to a consent order issued by the federal trade commission on september   we agreed to divest a total of outpatient dialysis centers and several home based dialysis programs in order to complete the acquisition of dsi 
in conjunction with the consent order  on september   we completed the sale of outpatient dialysis centers to dialysis newco  inc dialysis newco a portfolio company of frazier healthcare vi  lp and new enterprise associates  limited partnership pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated august  effective october   we also completed the sale of two additional outpatient dialysis centers to dialysis newco that were previously pending state regulatory approval 
we received total net cash consideration of approximately million for all of the outpatient dialysis centers that were divested 
capital structure changes and other items on august   we entered into an increase joinder agreement under our existing credit agreement 
pursuant to the increase joinder agreement  we increased the revolving credit facility by million  to a total of million  and entered into an additional million term loan a the new term loan a required a principal payment of million on december  and thereafter requires annual principal payments of million with the balance of million due in  and bears interest at libor floor of plus an interest rate margin of subject to a rating based step down to 
on november   the total existing term loan a outstanding principal balance was paid off 
see above for further details 
during the year ended december  we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling million on the term loan a  million on term loan a and million on the term loan b 
interest rate swaps and caps in january  we entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling billion that went effective on january   as a means of hedging our exposure to and volatility from variable based interest rate changes as part of our overall risk management strategy 
as of december   we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling million 
these agreements had the economic effect of modifying the libor variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our term loan a to fixed rates ranging from to  resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of  including the term loan a margin of 
during the year ended december   we accrued net charges of million from these swaps which are included in debt expense 
as of december   the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of million 
in addition  in january  we also entered into five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling billion that went effective on january  these agreements have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of on an equivalent amount of our term loan b debt 
the cap agreements expire on september  as of december   the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of million 
during the year ended december   we recorded million  net of tax  as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements  net of the amortization of the interest rate cap premiums that were reclassified into net income 
as a result of the embedded libor floors in some of our debt agreements and the swap and cap agreements  our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was  based upon the current margins in effect of for the term loan a  for the term loan a and for the term loan b  as of december  as of december   interest rates on our term loan a and term loan b debt were effectively fixed because of an embedded libor floor which is higher than actual libor as of such date 
furthermore  the interest rate on the  million of our term loan b is subject to interest rate caps if libor should rise above 
interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms 
the libor variable component of our interest rate on our term loan a is economically fixed as a result of interest rate swaps 
our overall weighted average effective interest rate in was and as of december  was 
stock repurchases we did not repurchase any of our common stock in during  we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million  or an average price of per share  pursuant to a previously announced authorization by the board of directors on november   that authorized an additional million of share repurchases of our common stock 
as a result of these transactions  the total outstanding authorization for share repurchases as of december  was million 
this stock repurchase program has no expiration date 
other items on july   we entered into a first national service provider agreement  or the agreement  with nxstage medical inc nxstage 
under the terms of the agreement we have the ability to continue to purchase nxstage system one hemodialysis machines and related supplies at discount prices 
in addition  we may  in lieu of cash rebate  vest in warrants to purchase nxstage common stock based upon achieving certain system one home patient growth targets by june   and the warrants are exercisable for up to a cumulative total of million shares of common stock over the three years at an initial exercise price of per share 
from the period july  through june   we earned warrants to purchase  shares of nxstage common stock 
in october we exercised our right to purchase  shares of nxstage common stock at per share  for a total of approximately million and in february  we sold all  shares for approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet  we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties 
substantially all of our facilities are leased 
we have potential acquisition obligations for several joint ventures and for some of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in the form of put provisions 
if these put provisions were exercised  we would be required to purchase the third party owners noncontrolling interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling interests put to us  which is intended to approximate fair value 
for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have potential cash commitments to provide operating capital advances as needed to several other dialysis centers that are wholly owned by third parties or centers in which we own an equity investment  as well as to physician owned vascular access clinics that we operate under management and administrative services agreements 
the following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions less than year years years after years total scheduled payments under contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on the senior notes interest payments on the term loan b interest payments on the term loan b capital lease obligations operating leases potential cash requirements under existing commitments letters of credit noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions pay fixed swaps potential obligations operating capital advances assuming no changes to libor based interest rates as the term loan b currently bears interest at libor floor of plus an interest rate margin of 
assuming no changes to libor based interest rates as the term loan b currently bears interest at libor floor of plus an interest rate margin of the pay fixed swap obligations represent the estimated fair market values of our interest rate swap agreements that are based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs and other current market conditions that existed as of december  this amount represents the estimated potential obligation that we would be required to pay based upon the estimated future settlement of each specific tranche over the term of the swap agreements  assuming no future changes in the forward yield curve 
the actual amount of our obligation associated with these swaps in the future will depend upon changes in the libor based interest rates that can fluctuate significantly depending upon market conditions  and other relevant factors that can affect the fair market value of these swap agreements 
in addition to the above commitments  we are obligated to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis products and supplies at fixed prices through from gambro renal products  inc in connection with the product supply agreement 
our total expenditures for the year ended december  on such products were approximately of our total us dialysis operating costs in each year 
in january  we entered into an agreement with fresenius which committed us to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment  parts and supplies from them through our total expenditures for the year ended december  on such products were approximately of our total us operating costs 
the actual amount of purchases in future years from gambro renal products and fresenius will depend upon a number of factors  including the operating requirements of our centers  the number of centers we acquire  growth of our existing centers  and in the case of the product supply agreement  gambro renal products ability to meet our needs 
in november  we entered into a seven year sourcing and supply agreement the original agreement with amgen usa inc that expires on december  under the terms of the agreement we will purchase epo in amounts necessary to meet no less than of our requirements for esas 
the actual amount of epo that we will purchase from amgen will depend upon the amount of epo administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve 
in december we entered into an amendment to our agreement with amgen that makes non material changes to certain terms of the agreement for the period from january  through december  under the terms of the original agreement before the amendment  we were required to purchase epo in amounts necessary to meet no less than of our requirements of esas and are still required to do so after in addition  all of the other conditions as specified in the original agreement entered into in november still apply 
settlements of approximately million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made 
contingencies the information in note to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities  contingencies and temporary equity 
all significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary 
actual results will generally differ from these estimates 
changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods 
certain accounting estimates  including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable  impairments of long lived assets  accounting for income taxes  quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals  consolidation of variable interest entities  purchase accounting valuation estimates  fair value estimates  stock based compensation and medical liability claims are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates 
dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis and related lab services revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period 
payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments 
in addition  ongoing insurance coverage changes  geographic coverage differences  differing interpretations of contract coverage  and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process 
net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering  among other items  retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews  audits  billing reviews and other matters 
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on a the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor eg  for medicare patients and b for the portion not paid by the primary government payor  the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage eg  medicaid secondary coverage  the patient s commercial health plan secondary coverage  or the patient 
effective january   our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare became subject to certain variations under medicare s new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors 
our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture  document and bill for medicare s base payment rate and these other factors 
in addition  as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system  our revenue recognition is now subject to a greater degree of estimating risk 
commercial healthcare plans  including contracted managed care payors  are billed at our usual and customary rates  however  revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided 
net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements  non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known  estimated secondary collections  historical collection experience  historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments retractions  inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments  slow down in collections  a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues 
determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than  us patients at any point in time  together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month  requires complex  resource intensive processes 
collections  refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided 
we generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within of its revenue  which can represent as much as of dialysis and related lab services operating income 
changes in estimates are reflected in the then current financial statements based on on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses  and have not been significant 
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received 
hcp revenue recognition 
hcp revenues consist primarily of fees for medical services provided under capitated contracts with various health plans and under risk sharing programs 
revenues with respect to both professional and institutional capitation are recognized in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive health care and are based on the number of enrollees selecting an hcp associated group physician employed or affiliated with one of hcp s medical group entities as their primary health care provider 
capitation payments received for enrollees under medicare advantage plans are subject to retroactive adjustment depending upon certain clinical and demographic factors 
we estimate the amount of current year adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjust our estimates during the third quarter upon receipt of payments from cms related to prior year 
any difference between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement 
in addition  as compensation under hcp s various managed care related agreements with hospitals  we are entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses  and any such risk share amount to which we are entitled is recorded as hcp revenues 
in addition  pursuant to such managed care related agreements  hcp agrees to be responsible should the third party incur a deficit as a result of institutional expenses being in excess of institutional capitation revenue 
as with global capitation  revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive health care 
risk share revenues that is  the portion of the excess of institutional capitation revenue to which hcp is entitled less institutional expenses  in contrast  are based on the number of enrollees and significant estimating risk relating to institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees 
the medical groups also receive other incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria and the amounts accrued when earned can be reasonably estimated 
differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement 
impairments of long lived assets 
we account for impairments of long lived assets  which include property and equipment  equity investments in non consolidated businesses  amortizable intangible assets and goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance 
impairment reviews are performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year  and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized 
we are required to assess our tax positions on a more likely than not criteria and to also determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
these calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain and future events unpredictable 
variable compensation accruals 
we estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals 
our estimates  which include compensation incentives for bonuses  and other awards  are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award 
actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals  as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our board of directors 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
we rely on the operating activities of certain entities that we do not directly own or control  but over which we have indirect influence and of which we are considered the primary beneficiary 
under accounting guidance applicable to variable interest entities  we have determined that these entities are to be included in our consolidated financial statements 
the analyses upon which this determination rests are complex  involve uncertainties  and require significant judgment on various matters  some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement 
while this determination has a meaningful effect on the description and classification of various amounts in our consolidated financial statements  non consolidation of these entities would not have had a material effect on our results of operations attributable to the company for the year ended december  purchase accounting valuation estimates 
we make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets  liabilities  contingent earn out consideration  noncontrolling interests and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions 
these assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future 
fair value estimates 
we have recorded certain assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests temporary equity subject to put provisions at fair value 
the fasb defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions 
we have measured the fair values of our applicable assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels 
the fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap and cap agreements were based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates  forward yield curves  implied volatility and credit default swap pricing 
the fair value of funds on deposit with third parties are based primarily on quoted close or bid market prices of the same or similar assets 
the fair value of our contingent earn out considerations were primarily based upon unobservable inputs including projected ebitda  the estimate of achieving other performance targets and the estimate probability of the earn out payments being made by using option pricing techniques and simulation models of expected ebitda and other performance targets 
for our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values of these based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings  patient mix and other performance indicators  as well as other factors 
the estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled  which could vary significantly from our current estimates 
the estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers access to the capital markets  which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non dialysis related businesses  the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third party owners noncontrolling interests 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares  or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash 
the value of stock based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight line basis over the vesting terms of the awards  adjusted for expected forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events  including the expected term of the awards  the expected future volatility of our stock price  and expected future risk free interest rates 
medical liability claims associated with hcp 
the medical groups are responsible for the medical services that associated physicians and contracted hospitals provide to assigned hmo enrollees 
the company provides medical services to health plan enrollees through a network of contracted providers under sub capitation and fee for service arrangements  company operated clinics and staff physicians 
medical costs for professional and institutional services rendered by contracted providers are recorded as medical expenses and hospital expenses  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 
costs for operating medical clinics  including the salaries of medical and non medical personnel and support costs  are recorded in clinic support and other operating costs 
an estimate of amounts due to contracted physicians  hospitals  and other professional providers is included in medical payables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
medical claims payable include claims reported as of the balance sheet date and estimates of ibnr 
such estimates are developed using actuarial methods and are based on many variables  including the utilization of health care services  historical payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  changes in membership  and other factors 
the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
many of the medical contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services 
such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed following the contract implementation 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in current operations 
significant new accounting standards on january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb  accounting standard update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
this standard amends the two step goodwill impairment test required under the prior accounting guidance 
this amendment allows reporting entities the option to first assess certain qualitative factors to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount to determine whether the two step impairment test is necessary 
if an entity concludes that certain events or circumstances demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the entity is required to proceed to step one of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted fasb s asu no 
 health care entities presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
this standard amends the prior presentation and disclosure requirements for health care entities that recognize significant amounts of patient service revenues at the time the services are rendered without assessing the patient s ability to pay 
this standard requires health care entities to reclassify the provision for bad debts from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenues 
in addition  this standard requires more disclosure on the policies for recognizing revenue  assessing bad debts  as well as quantitative and qualitative information regarding changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
this standard was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented 
upon adoption of this standard  we changed our presentation of our provision for uncollectible accounts related to patient service revenues as a deduction from our patient service operating revenues and enhanced our disclosures as indicated above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
on january   we adopted fasb s asu no 
as amended by asu no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income 
this standard amends the prior presentation requirements for comprehensive income by eliminating the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of equity 
this standard allows two alternatives on how to present the various components of comprehensive income 
these alternatives are either to report the components of comprehensive income separately on the income statement or to present total other comprehensive income and the components of other comprehensive income in a separate statement 
this standard does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item must be reclassified into net income 
the fasb temporarily deferred the requirement to present separate line items on the statement of income for the amounts that would be realized and reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income 
no timetable has been set for fasb s reconsideration of this item 
this standard  except for the deferred requirements described above  was applied retrospectively 
upon adoption of this standard  we presented total other comprehensive income and the components of other comprehensive income in a separate statement of comprehensive income 
on january   we adopted fasb s asu no 
 fair value measurement 
this standard amends the current fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to improve comparability between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the intent of this standard is to update the disclosures that describe several of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and to enhance disclosures about fair value measurements in a manner that will improve consistency between us gaap and ifrs 
this standard does not change the application of the requirements on fair value measurements and disclosures 
this standard was applied prospectively  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table below presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of december  the variable rates presented reflect the weighted average libor rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect as of december  the term loan a currently bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of  the term loan a also currently bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of and along with the revolving line of credit are subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios including a leverage ratio 
the term loan b currently bears interest at libor floor of plus an interest rate margin of subject to a ratings based step down to and the term loan b bears interest at libor floor of plus an interest rate margin of 
expected maturity date thereafter total average interest rate fair value dollars in millions long term debt fixed rate variable rate notional amount contract maturity date pay fixed receive variable fair value dollars in millions swaps pay fixed rate to libor cap agreements libor above our senior secured credit facilities  which include the term loan a  the term loan a  the term loan b and the term loan b  consist of various individual tranches of debt that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months currently  all tranches are one month in duration 
for the term loan a and the term loan a  each tranche bears interest at a libor rate that is determined by the duration of such tranche plus an interest rate margin 
the libor variable component of the interest rate for each tranche is reset as such tranche matures and a new tranche is established 
libor can fluctuate significantly depending upon conditions in the credit and capital markets 
the term loan b and the term loan b are subject to libor floors of and  respectively 
because actual libor  as of december   was lower than either of these embedded libor floors  the interest rates on the term loan b and the term loan b are treated as effectively fixed for purposes of the table above 
we have included both of these term loans in the fixed rate totals in the table above until such time as the actual libor based component of our interest rate exceeds on the term loan b and on the term loan b at such time  we will then be subject to libor based interest rate volatility on the libor variable component of our interest rate on all of the term loan b  as well as for the term loan b  but limited to a maximum rate of on  million of outstanding principal debt on the term loan b as a result of the interest rate cap agreements  as described below 
the remaining million outstanding principal balance of the term loan b is subject to libor based interest rate volatility above a floor of 
as of december   we maintained a total of nine interest rate swap agreements with amortizing notional amounts totaling million 
these agreements had the economic effect of modifying the libor variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our term loan a to fixed rates ranging from to  resulting in an overall weighted average effective interest rate of  including the term loan a margin of 
the swap agreements expire by september  and require monthly interest payments 
during the year ended december   we accrued net charges of million from these swaps which are included in debt expense 
as of december   the total fair value of these swap agreements was a liability of million 
we estimate that approximately million of existing unrealized pre tax losses in other comprehensive income at december  will be reclassified into income during as of december   we maintained five interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling  million 
these agreements have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of on an equivalent amount of our term loan b debt 
the cap agreements expire on september  as of december   the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of million 
during the year ended december   we recorded million  net of tax  as a decrease to other comprehensive income due to unrealized valuation changes in the cap agreements 
as a result of the embedded libor floors in some of our debt agreements and the swap and cap agreements  the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was  based upon the current margins in effect of for both the term loan a and for the term loan a and for both the term loan b and for the term loan b  as of december  as of december   interest rates on our term loan b and term loan b debt are effectively fixed because of an embedded libor floor which is higher than actual libor as of such date
