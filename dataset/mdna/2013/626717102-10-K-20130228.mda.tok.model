item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with petroleum marketing operations in the united states and refining and marketing operations in the united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in item of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue by selling oil and natural gas production to customers in the united states  canada  malaysia and other countries 
additionally  the company generates revenue by selling refined petroleum and ethanol products at hundreds of locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for uk refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its uk refinery  us ethanol plants and at worldwide oil production facilities  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the us that are primarily located at walmart supercenters  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins  which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions and note holders 
changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the company  especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis one barrel of crude oil equals six thousand cubic feet of natural gas by the company in in  the company s ratio of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to be approximately two thirds oil  one third gas  due to a combination of growing oil production and declining north american natural gas production 
if the prices for crude oil and natural gas should weaken in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
worldwide oil prices in were generally comparable to  while the sale prices for natural gas produced in north america was significantly weaker than the prior year 
the sales price for a barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude oil averaged in  in and in the nymex natural gas price per million british thermal units mmbtu averaged in  in and in while the price of wti fell slightly in  certain other benchmark oil prices  such as dated brent  experienced small increases during the year 
natural gas prices fell in primarily due to continued expansion in north american gas supply and secondly due to a warmer than normal winter season in in the us and canada 
gas supplies grew primarily due to a number of expanding north american unconventional gas resource plays 
worldwide oil prices were significantly higher in than  but north american natural gas prices were weaker in than in the prior year 
crude oil prices rose in primarily due to a combination of recovering demand and unrest in the oil rich middle east and northern africa 
while the prices of wti crude oil rose almost compared to the prior year  crude oil sold based on other worldwide benchmark prices  such as brent and tapis  rose even more than wti in that year 
the rise in prices of wti crude oil  which is only used as a benchmark in north america  was held back compared to other worldwide benchmark price increases due to a somewhat temporary crude oil dislocation discount and a bit of supply demand disparity in the continental us during the disparity between crude oil and natural gas prices in north america continued to widen during both and on an energy equivalent basis due to gas production growth that exceeded demand 
us crude oil prices in early have been similar to average prices  while natural gas prices in north america in have thus far been slightly above the levels due to cold temperatures across much of the northern us during the early winter season 

table of contents results of operations murphy oil s results of operations  with associated diluted earnings per share eps  for the last three years are presented in the following table 
years ended december millions of dollars  except eps net income diluted eps income from continuing operations diluted eps income from discontinued operations diluted eps murphy oil s net income in increased compared to primarily due to higher earnings for continuing exploration and production e p operations  partially offset by lower earnings for continuing refining and marketing operations r m  lower income from discontinued operations  and higher net costs of corporate activities that were not allocated to operating segments 
net income in was higher than  with the improvement primarily attributable to better earnings for r m continuing operations  higher income from discontinued operations  which was essentially attributable to strong us refining results prior to sale of these assets  and lower net costs for corporate activities 
lower e p earnings for continuing operations in  primarily associated with a large impairment charge in republic of the congo  somewhat offset these favorable results in other areas 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in more detail in the following sections 
vs 
net income in was million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in income from continuing operations was million per diluted share in  up from million per diluted share in earnings for increased primarily due to a combination of lower impairment charges  income tax benefits  higher crude oil sales volumes  lower exploration expenses and higher uk r m earnings 
these were partially offset by lower north american natural gas sales prices  lower us retail marketing margins  and unfavorable effects of foreign exchange compared to the prior year 
net income in and included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share and million per diluted share  respectively 
the stronger results for discontinued operations in were primarily associated with operating income and a net gain on disposal of two us refineries meraux  louisiana and superior  wisconsin and associated marketing assets which were sold in by business unit  e p income from continuing operations improved million in  primarily due to higher crude oil production  lower impairment expense in republic of the congo  income tax benefits associated with exploration activities in republic of the congo and suriname  and lower exploration expenses 
e p operating results were unfavorably affected in compared to the prior year by lower north american natural gas sales prices and higher expenses for production  depreciation and administration 
income from r m continuing operations was million lower in  with the reduction mostly attributable to lower earnings  including an impairment charge  for us ethanol production operations  plus lower us retail fuel margins  with these more than offsetting significantly better uk refining margins in the current year 
the net costs of corporate activities were higher by million in  mostly attributable to unfavorable effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
to a lesser degree  the corporate net costs were unfavorably affected by lower interest income and higher administrative expenses 
sales and other operating revenues grew billion in compared to due to higher crude oil sales volumes for the e p business  plus slightly larger sales volumes for both the us and us r m continuing operations 
gain loss on sale of assets was million less in than because the earlier year 
table of contents included a million gain on sale of natural gas storage assets in spain 
interest and other operating income was unfavorable by million in compared to mostly due to an million unfavorable pretax variance from the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies  plus interest income in of million associated with a recovery of federal royalties for certain deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
the expense associated with crude oil and product purchases increased by million in compared to primarily due to higher costs for wholesale gasoline and other motor fuels which were purchased for resale at the company s retail fueling stations in the us and us operating expenses were million more in than due to a combination of higher oil and natural gas production costs and higher costs for us retail gasoline station operations 
exploration expenses were million lower in compared to due to more drilling success in  plus lower geophysical expense in the gulf of mexico  malaysia  brunei and the kurdistan region of iraq 
selling and general expenses were million more in than in primarily due to higher employee compensation and professional services costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense rose million in versus due to higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes in and higher e p per unit depreciation rates 
impairment of properties was million lower in than in  primarily due to a smaller impairment charge in republic of the congo in  partially offset by a writedown in the current year of the hereford  texas  ethanol production facility 
accretion of asset retirement obligations was million more in than primarily due to higher discounted abandonment liabilities for wells drilled in in malaysia  higher estimated abandonment costs for wells in the gulf of mexico  and higher future reclamation costs for synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
redetermination of working interest at the terra nova field was a million benefit in due to nonrecurring income achieved upon final settlement of the redetermination process in early interest expense in was million less than primarily due to lower average interest rates paid on borrowed funds in the later year  partially offset by the effects of higher average outstanding debt levels in the most recent year 
the benefit from capitalized interest was million higher in than the prior year due to larger levels of financing costs allocated to ongoing oil development projects in the later year 
income tax expense in was million less than primarily due to us income tax benefits of million in associated with exploration activities in republic of the congo and suriname 
the consolidated effective tax rate was in compared to in  with the lower rate in the later year caused by the us tax benefits for republic of the congo and suriname  a lower percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in  and lower current year exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses will be realized in or future years to reduce taxes owed 
the tax rates in both and were higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the company s uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in or future years 
income from discontinued operations was million per diluted share in and million per diluted share in income from discontinued operations in both years included operating results for oil and gas production operations in the uk  but discontinued operations in included operating profits of million associated with the two us petroleum refineries sold in late  plus an million after tax gain on sale of these refineries 
vs 
net income in totaled million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in income from continuing operations was million per diluted share in compared to million per diluted share in the reduction in income from continuing operations in comparison to was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of million in to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field offshore republic of the congo 
this was mostly offset by higher oil prices and stronger us retail marketing margins in the later year 
the net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was lower in than in net income in included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share compared to income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share in the higher income for discontinued operations in was primarily associated with both strong operating income and a gain on sale of two us refineries and associated marketing assets which were sold in 
table of contents e p income in was million lower than  primarily attributable to the million impairment charge at the azurite oil field in republic of the congo 
other unfavorable impacts in included higher dry hole costs compared to  lower crude oil sales volumes  lower north american natural gas sales prices and higher extraction costs for oil and gas produced in e p results in benefited from a higher average sales prices for crude oil produced and a higher sales prices for natural gas produced offshore sarawak  malaysia 
income from r m continuing operations was million higher in compared to  essentially attributable to stronger us retail gasoline marketing margins of more than per gallon and larger profits on sales of merchandise in the us retail marketing business 
the net costs of corporate activities were million less in than primarily due to gains from transactions denominated in foreign currencies in compared to losses on such transactions in during the us dollar generally strengthened in comparison to the malaysian ringgit  which provided a favorable foreign currency impact to the company s earnings due to fewer us dollars being required to pay and future income taxes owed in the local currency 
sales and operating revenues were billion more in than primarily due to higher prices realized on crude oil production and gasoline and other refined products sold by the company 
gain on sale of assets classified in continuing operations was million more in than principally due to a profit on sale of gas storage assets in spain in interest and other income loss in was favorable million compared to principally due to improved income effects from transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  the company collected higher interest income on invested cash balances in primarily due to larger average invested balances during the year 
crude oil and product purchases expense was billion more in than due to higher costs of crude oil feedstocks at the milford haven  wales refinery  higher costs for gasoline purchased for resale in the us retail marketing operations and an increase in volume of merchandise purchased for resale at us retail gasoline stations 
operating expenses in were million more than mostly due to higher costs associated with the company s production of oil and natural gas in  plus higher operating expenses at us retail marketing stations  and higher power and other costs at the milford haven  wales refinery 
exploration expense in was million above primarily due to higher dry hole costs associated with unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities in brunei  indonesia  canada and suriname 
selling and general expenses rose million in compared to primarily due to a combination of higher costs for employee compensation and professional services 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was down million in mostly due to fewer barrels of oil equivalent produced in compared to impairment of properties of million in was attributable to a charge to reduce the net book value of the azurite oil field to fair value 
the charge was necessitated by a reduction of proved oil reserves at this field at year end accretion of asset retirement obligations increased million in  primarily due to future abandonment costs to be incurred on oil and gas development wells drilled in the eagle ford shale and montney areas in  and higher estimated abandonment costs for existing wells in the gulf of mexico and offshore malaysia and for synthetic oil operations at syncrude in western canada 
the income effect of the redetermination of the company s working interest at the terra nova field  offshore eastern canada  was favorable million in compared to the final settlement for the redetermination was made in early at a net cost to the company that was million less than previously estimated 
the benefit from this reduced settlement payment was recognized in the net cost of million in related to the portion of terra nova s operating results in that were estimated to be owed to other partners upon final settlement 
due to the redetermination process  the company s working interest at terra nova was reduced from to 
interest expense in was million more than primarily due to interest associated with tax reassessments in canada in interest capitalized to oil and gas development projects in was million below due to cessation of interest capitalized upon commencement of production at the tupper west area in western canada in the first quarter income tax expense was million more in than due to higher pretax income in plus higher exploration and impairment expenses in for which no tax benefit was recognizable by the company 
the effective tax rate on a consolidated basis increased from in to in due to a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in and due to higher exploration  impairment and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefits were recognized due to no assurance that 
table of contents these expenses would be realized in or future years to reduce taxes owed 
the tax rates in both and were higher than the us federal statutory rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the company s uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these expenses in or future years 
income from discontinued operations was million higher in than due to stronger us refining margins in prior to the sale of the refineries near the end of the third quarter of additionally  discontinued operations included a pretax gain on sale of the two us refineries of million

the company s average realized sales price for crude oil  condensate and gas liquids in for continuing operations increased per barrel over the company s average natural gas sales prices in sarawak malaysia were also higher in than  but natural gas sales prices in in north america were significantly below levels 
crude oil and liquids sales volumes increased in while natural gas sales volumes rose 
the increase in hydrocarbon sales volumes in led to higher expenses for production and depreciation of million and million  respectively 
the year had less exploration expenses of million compared to  essentially due to lower expenses related to unsuccessful exploratory drilling and geophysical activities 
crude oil sales volumes increased in in the us primarily due to higher volumes produced in the eagle ford shale area of south texas 
conventional oil sales volumes in canada in were less than primarily due to lower gross production at the terra nova field  where more downtime for maintenance occurred in the current year 
synthetic oil sales volumes at syncrude increased in due to higher gross production compared to sales volumes for crude oil produced in malaysia were higher in 
table of contents primarily due to new wells brought on production at the kikeh field offshore sabah 
crude oil sales volumes decreased in in republic of the congo due to field decline and a well failure at the azurite field 
natural gas sales volumes in increased compared to the prior year principally due to more wells producing for a longer period in the tupper area in western canada and higher gas volumes produced in the eagle ford shale 
e p income in was million less than in primarily due to a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field to fair value at year end the period also had higher exploration expense  lower crude oil sales volumes and lower north american natural gas sales prices 
however  benefited from higher oil and sarawak natural gas sales prices and higher natural gas sales volumes 
the company s realized crude oil sales prices for continuing operations averaged per barrel more in than north american natural gas sales prices in were per mcf below levels  but natural gas sales prices from fields offshore sarawak were higher in by per mcf 
crude oil  condensate and gas liquids sales volumes from continuing operations were lower in than in  compared to a decrease in oil production volumes of in oil sales volumes declined more than oil production volumes during primarily due to the timing of scheduling oil sales transactions at the kikeh field offshore malaysia 
sales volumes at kikeh were below production levels in due to an increase in the volume of unsold barrels at the field at year end  while in  kikeh sales volumes exceeded production 
us crude oil sales volumes were lower in than principally due to less production at the thunder hawk field in the gulf of mexico 
lower crude oil sales volumes in canada in were mostly attributable to production issues and a lower company working interest percentage in at the terra nova field  but this was partially offset by higher sales volumes at the seal heavy oil field in alberta 
crude oil sales volumes at kikeh in fell compared to due to lower annual production in caused by well downtime for mechanical issues 
sales of crude oil and condensate increased at fields offshore sarawak in due to higher volumes produced during the year 
crude oil sales volumes in republic of the congo fell in due to production decline at the azurite field 
natural gas sales volumes for continuing operations increased in and the improvement was primarily attributable to higher gas volumes produced during at the tupper west area in western canada following start up in the first quarter of the year 
natural gas sales volumes also improved in at the tupper area in canada and at fields offshore sarawak  both of these areas had active development programs during natural gas sales volumes were lower during at the kikeh field principally due to less volumes produced because of mechanical issues with wells

a summary of oil and gas revenues  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states oil and gas liquids natural gas canada conventional oil and gas liquids synthetic oil natural gas malaysia oil and gas liquids natural gas republic of the congo oil total oil and gas revenues the company s total crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production averaged  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in 
table of contents united states crude oil production averaged  barrels per day in  an annual record for the company in the us  and an increase from  barrels per day in the us increase was primarily attributable to an ongoing development drilling program in the eagle ford shale area in south texas 
heavy oil production in the western canada sedimentary basin of  barrels per day in was about flat with crude oil production offshore canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in essentially due to more downtime for maintenance at the terra nova field and well decline at the hibernia field 
synthetic oil production of  barrels per day in slightly exceeded volumes of  per day 
crude oil and liquids production in malaysia averaged  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in  with the increase mainly due to additional wells brought on production at the kikeh field 
oil production in republic of the congo fell to  barrels per day in after averaging  barrels per day in  with the reduction due to a well that went off production during and normal decline at other wells in the field 
crude oil production in the uk was  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in the uk increase in was primarily at schiehallion  where better overall performance more than offset lower volumes at mungo monan 
expected sales of all uk oil and natural gas operations in early led the company to report these uk e p activities as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
united states oil production decreased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in with the lower volumes mostly caused by field decline at thunder hawk that was primarily due to a delay in development drilling operations in and following the macondo incident in april the production decline at thunder hawk was partially offset by higher oil volumes produced in at the eagle ford shale area in south texas 
production of heavy oil in western canada was  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in  primarily due to ongoing drilling operations at the seal area in alberta 
oil production offshore canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in primarily due to field decline at terra nova and a reduction of the company s working interest at this field from in to in synthetic oil operations at syncrude had net production of  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in  with the increase caused by a lower royalty rate in due to higher costs incurred for the operations 
oil production in malaysia decreased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  primarily due to lower production at the kikeh field 
mechanical issues at kikeh led to certain wells being down for a portion of oil production in malaysia was favorably affected in by higher condensate and other gas liquids produced at gas fields offshore sarawak 
the azurite field offshore republic of the congo averaged  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in due to faster than expected well decline 
oil production from discontinued operations in the uk was  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  with the decline primarily due to more downtime at the schiehallion and mungo monan fields during the later year 
worldwide sales of natural gas were a company record million cubic feet mmcf per day in  after averaging mmcf per day in and mmcf per day in natural gas sales volumes in the us were mmcf per day in  up from production of mmcf per day as higher production in the eagle ford shale area more than offset declines at fields in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas volumes in western canada increased from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in essentially due to higher gas volumes produced at the tupper area  as more wells were on production at tupper west during natural gas sales volumes offshore sarawak  malaysia  averaged mmcf per day in following volumes of mmcf per day in gas sales at the kikeh field averaged mmcf per day in  up from mmcf per day the prior year 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk reported as discontinued operations fell from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in due to well decline at the mungo monan field during the later year 
natural gas production in the us averaged mmcf per day in  compared to mmcf per day in the lower volume in was primarily attributable to the thunder hawk field where production declined during due to delay in development drilling operations following the macondo incident in april 
table of contents natural gas production in canada rose from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in primarily due to start up of production at the tupper west area in western canada in the first quarter gas sales volumes also increased in at the nearby tupper area due to development drilling activities during the year 
natural gas production in malaysia rose to mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in natural gas sales volumes during at sarawak and kikeh averaged mmcf per day and mmcf per day  respectively 
gas sales volumes rose mmcf per day at sarawak in due to higher demand from the local purchaser  while kikeh gas volumes fell mmcf per day in due to lower demand and wells down for mechanical repairs for a portion of the year 
natural gas production from discontinued operations in the uk fell from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in primarily due to more downtime for repairs at the amethyst field during the company s average worldwide realized sales price for crude oil  condensate and gas liquids from continuing operations was per barrel in compared to per barrel in and per barrel in the average realized crude oil sales price for continuing operations increased in compared to the higher realized price for was favorable to the reduction in west texas intermediate wti sales price between the years 
other benchmark oil prices used for sale of company crude oil  such as dated brent  performed more favorably than wti 
during  the company began to sell its kikeh crude oil based on a new kikeh benchmark price  where it had been sold since late on a brent crude oil benchmark 
compared to  the company s average crude oil sales prices fell in the us to average per barrel 
heavy oil sales prices in canada fell in to an average of per barrel 
offshore canada oil sold at per barrel in  an increase of 
canadian synthetic crude oil sold for less in and averaged per barrel 
the crude oil sales price in malaysia increased to an average price of per barrel in crude oil sold in republic of the congo increased to a price of per barrel in the company s average realized oil sales price of in for continuing operations was an increase of compared to the average price of wti crude oil rose during the company s average oil price increased more than wti because other worldwide benchmark prices rose more than wti in dated brent prices  for example  rose during crude oil prices strengthened in due to an improvement in energy demand in association with a slowly recovering worldwide economy and unrest in northern africa and the middle east during that caused concern in the oil markets about the potential for supply disruptions 
compared to  the company s average crude oil sales prices in the us rose to per barrel  heavy oil prices in canada sold for more and averaged per barrel  offshore canada prices increased to per barrel  synthetic crude oil sold for more at per barrel  crude oil in malaysia was up and averaged per barrel  and crude oil in republic of the congo sold at per barrel in  an increase of from the company s north american natural gas prices retracted in compared to  while prices in other areas were a bit stronger in north american natural gas sales prices were hurt by an oversupply of gas caused by both a growing profile of unconventional gas production on the continent and an unusually warm winter season in the primary gas consuming markets in the us during the company s average sales prices for natural gas in north america decreased to per thousand cubic feet mcf in  which was composed of a decline to per mcf in the us and a decline to per mcf in canada 
natural gas produced offshore sarawak sold for more in than in and averaged per mcf in the later year 
natural gas sales prices in north america in did not generally increase in concert with crude oil prices during that year 
a growing gas supply from unconventional sources such as shale operations kept gas prices in check during the company s average realized north american natural gas sales price was mcf in  a decline of from the per mcf realized in natural gas produced in offshore sarawak was sold at an average price of per mcf  an increase of from the per mcf realized during 
table of contents based on sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production continuing operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 
production expenses for continuing operations were  million in   million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil malaysia republic of the congo worldwide excluding synthetic oil production expense per equivalent barrel in the us increased in compared to due to a significantly larger proportion of production in the later year coming from the eagle ford shale in south texas  where the average per barrel cost exceeded the us average 
in and beyond  the company anticipates the per barrel cost for eagle ford shale production to be below the us average cost 
cost per barrel for canada conventional oil and gas operations  excluding synthetic oil  was higher in than due to additional maintenance costs in the current year at the terra nova field 
this canadian cost increase was tempered by higher natural gas production at the lower than average cost tupper area 
lower future tupper area production  attributable to reduced drilling levels caused by depressed sales prices  is expected to lead to increases in per unit production expense at tupper as well as for overall conventional canada production in the reduction in production costs per barrel for synthetic oil operations in compared to was attributable to lower natural gas power costs in the current year 
due to anticipated additional government emission and other environmental requirements in and beyond  the company expects synthetic oil production expense to be higher on a per barrel basis in future years 
production expense in malaysia declined in compared to due to less well maintenance and workover costs at the kikeh field 
per barrel production expense in in republic of the congo was significantly higher than due to lower production levels and unsuccessful workover costs at a well in the azurite field 
production expense per equivalent barrel in the us increased in compared to due to lower volumes produced at the thunder hawk field and higher facility rental costs in the early days of the eagle ford shale operation as production ramped up 
the per unit cost for canadian conventional oil and gas operations  excluding synthetic oil  was slightly higher in compared to as the benefit of significantly higher natural gas production at tupper west and tupper was more than offset by lower production volumes without a comparable reduction in costs at hibernia and terra nova 
higher cost per barrel in compared to at canadian synthetic oil operations was mostly caused by higher overall maintenance and fuel costs 
production cost per unit in malaysia was higher in compared to  with the increase primarily at kikeh caused by higher costs for the work program to address equipment damaged by sand produced with the oil and the associated downtime which led to lower oil production 
production expense in republic of the congo was lower on a per unit basis in compared to due to a reduction in gross costs incurred at the azurite field in the later year 

table of contents exploration expenses for continuing operations for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
expenses other than leasehold amortization are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry hole expense was million lower in than in due to better drilling success coupled with lower exploratory drilling spending 
dry hole expense in in other foreign areas was significantly lower than in primarily due to unsuccessful wells drilled in the prior year in brunei  indonesia and suriname 
dry hole expense in canada was also significantly lower in due to fewer unsuccessful wells drilled in southern alberta in the current year 
dry hole expense in the us was higher in mostly due to a decision by the owners in not to develop a well drilled in a prior year in the deepwater gulf of mexico  the well was expensed in malaysian operations had higher dry hole expense in due to an unsuccessful well drilled in block p and expensing of two wells drilled in a prior year offshore sarawak caused by government denial of a request for extension of an oil field development plan deadline 
dry hole expense in republic of the congo was higher in than due to expensing two wildcat wells following unsuccessful drilling in the mpn block in the later year 
geological and geophysical g g expenses were million lower in than areas with lower spending on seismic in included the gulf of mexico  brunei  the kurdistan region of iraq  and block h malaysia 
other exploration costs in were million below levels primarily due to lower lease rentals on undeveloped acreage in western canada in the current year 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose million in compared to  primarily due to higher amortization associated with eagle ford shale area leases 
dry hole expense was million higher in than due to more unsuccessful exploratory drilling results in  with the most significant areas including brunei  indonesia  southern alberta and suriname 
lower dry hole costs in in malaysia and republic of the congo somewhat offset these higher costs 
g g expenses were million higher in compared to the increase in g g expenses in was attributable to higher spending on seismic in brunei  the kurdistan region of iraq  block h malaysia and cameroon  but included lower seismic spending in republic of the congo 
other exploration costs were million more in than mostly due to higher office costs for exploration activities in brunei  indonesia and kurdistan region of iraq  and an exploration well drilling penalty in southern alberta 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense was million higher in than mostly due to lease costs associated with concessions in the kurdistan region of iraq  but partially offset by slightly lower amortization costs in for both eagle ford shale leases in south texas and the montney area leases in western canada 
the company s e p operations recorded an impairment charge of million in for oil production operations at the azurite field  offshore republic of the congo  compared to an impairment charge of million for azurite in the current year charge was required due to the removal of all proved reserves at year end following the company s decision to cease redrilling operations on a well that went off production during the year 
the reserves associated with the remaining producing wells were insufficient to allow for booking as proved reserves due to uneconomic results 
the impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of azurite to fair value was necessitated by a reduction in the field s proved oil reserves at year end due to poor performance for certain wells 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for continuing exploration and production operations totaled  million in  million in and million in the million increase in compared to was primarily caused by higher overall volumes of oil and natural gas sold during the current year 
additionally  the average per unit depreciation rate increased in  primarily due to a higher mix of production from the eagle ford shale and a higher unit rate at kikeh due to development drilling activities at the field 
the million decrease in compared to was primarily attributable to lower overall levels of hydrocarbon volumes sold  somewhat offset by a slightly higher per barrel depreciation rate based on a change in the mix of production between and the exploration and production business recorded expenses of million in  million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities 
because the liability for future abandonment of wells and other facilities is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment

environmental matters murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment 
virtually all operations of the company are affected by laws and regulations covering environmental  health and safety matters 
compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects murphy s overall cost of business  including capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities  and operating costs for ongoing environmental compliance 
murphy s competitive position may be impacted to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that competitors might not bear 
environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities and these are expected to continue to evolve in the foreseeable future 
the company is unable to predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on its operations 
violation of federal or state environmental laws  regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
a discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could  to the extent such event is not insured  subject murphy to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result 
murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and such capital expenditures were million in and are projected to be million in the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting murphy s operations are the us clean air act  which regulates air emissions  including greenhouse gas emissions the us clean water act  which regulates discharges into us waters the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases the us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which regulates solid waste and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal 
the us federal oil pollution act of opa  which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the united states the u 
s safe drinking water act  which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground injection wells the federal water pollution control act of fwpca also addressing discharge of pollutants into navigable waters the department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations 
the european union regulation for registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemicals reach the european union trading directive resulting in european emissions trading scheme 
table of contents these laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air  water and solid waste discharges 
they also generally require permits for new or modified operations 
many states and foreign countries where the company operates also have or are in the process of developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products  which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements 
murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations  including legal and administrative proceedings  governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations  which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines  underground storage tanks and general environmental operations 
murphy is actively engaged in the legislative and regulatory process  both nationally and internationally  in response to climate change issues and environmental and health related matters 
murphy s environmental  health  and safety committee  a standing committee of the board of directors  was created to oversee and monitor the company s environmental  health  and safety ehs policies and practices 
the board has approved a worldwide environmental  health  and safety policy the ehs policy  which is available on the company s web site 
in addition to requiring that the company comply with all applicable ehs laws and regulations  the ehs policy includes a directive that the company will continue to minimize the impact of its operations  products and services on the environment by implementing economically feasible projects that promote energy efficiency and use natural resources effectively 
cercla cercla commonly referred to as the superfund act  and comparable state statutes  primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon potentially responsible parties prp  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released  disposed  or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla requires reporting to the national response center for releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous if the released quantities exceed an epa established reportable level 
cercla also authorizes the us environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons 
in the course of ordinary operations  the company generates waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
murphy may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to remediate sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment 
the epa currently considers murphy to be a prp at two superfund sites 
at one site  the company has thus far been unable to ascertain any association with the superfund site  murphy intends to request further information as to the company s connection to the site 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
however  based on current negotiations and available information  the company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at the superfund sites and as such  it has not recorded a liability for remedial costs 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at these sites or other superfund sites 
the company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to remediate these superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
waste the company currently owns or leases  and has in the past owned or leased  properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled 
although the company has used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the company or on or under other locations where these wastes have 
table of contents been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under murphy s control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws murphy could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
while some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation  investigation  and or cleanup  murphy is investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses  including state funding for remediation  and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on its net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
although certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered from other sources  no assurance can be given that future recoveries from these sources will occur 
therefore  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of december  rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes 
murphy generates non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of rcra and comparable state statutes 
the company s operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses 
water under opa  owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
the company is not aware of opa claims made against murphy 
each murphy offshore facility in the gulf of mexico has in place an emergency evacuation plan eep and all such facilities are covered by an oil spill response plan osrp 
in the event of an explosion  personnel would be evacuated immediately in accordance with the eep 
the appropriate osrp would be activated if needed 
in the event of an oil spill or containment event  the appropriate osrp and containment plan would be executed as needed 
the eep is approved by the us coast guard uscg and the osrp and containment plan are approved by the bureau of ocean energy management boem 
the company also has comprehensive emergency and spill response plans for offshore facilities in international waters 
murphy s osrp utilizes a consortium of seasoned and well equipped contract service companies to provide response equipment and personnel 
one company has been contracted to provide spill containment and recovery equipment  including skimmers  boom  and vessels such as fast response boats and high volume open sea skimmer barges 
this company has hired other companies to store and maintain response equipment and provide certified tanks and barges 
murphy is a founding member of marine preservation association  which provides access to marine spill response corporation assets to support marine spills in the gulf of mexico and other offshore areas 
additionally  murphy has an agreement with another company to provide aerial dispersant spraying services  and has further contracted with another company to utilize their equipment for oil containment should a well blowout occur 
the federal water pollution control act of fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the fwpca imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation and 
table of contents damages 
murphy maintains wastewater discharge permits for its facilities where required pursuant to the fwpca and comparable state laws 
murphy has also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws 
the company believes that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
murphy utilizes hydraulic fracturing technology for its exploration and production activities in canada and the us murphy is actively engaged in exploration and production in the eagle ford shale play in south texas 
on january   the texas railroad commission finalized a rule that requires oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals and amount of water used in hydraulic fracturing of wells 
murphy is in substantial compliance with this rule 
air murphy s us operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state and local statutes 
the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which it operates 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in required most refining operations in the us to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the epa and state environmental agencies 
the european union has adopted an emissions trading scheme in response to the kyoto protocol in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
murphy s refinery at milford haven  wales  currently has the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements 
these environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred 
in  murphy was notified by the environment agency ea that it failed to surrender proper emission allowances  which murphy self reported to the ea in the ea has recommended a civil penalty of million for this matter 
the company has not yet paid the proposed civil penalty and is pursuing legal means regarding this matter 
climate change currently  various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
these include a promulgated epa regulation  mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for numerous industrial business segments  including refineries and offshore production  which became effective december  these were followed by a more recent regulation requiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for petroleum and natural gas systems  including onshore exploration and production facilities  which became effective december  and was revised december  during  us federal legislation epa s greenhouse gas endangerment finding  epa s prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  low carbon fuel standards  etc 
and various state actions were proposed finalized to develop statewide or regional programs  each of which have or could impose mandatory reductions and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
murphy believes it has met all of the epa required reporting deadlines and strives to ensure accurate and consistent emissions data reporting 
the impact of existing and pending climate change legislation  regulations  international treaties and accords could result in increased costs to the company to i operate and maintain facilities  ii install new emission controls on facilities  and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions trading program 
these actions could also impact the consumption of refined products  thereby affecting gasoline and ethanol marketing operations 
the physical impacts of climate change present potential risks for severe weather floods  hurricanes  tornadoes  etc 
at certain of the company s refined product terminals in the us and its offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico 
commensurate with this risk is the possibility of indirect financial and operational impacts to the company from disruptions to the operations of major customers or suppliers caused by severe weather 
the company has repositioned itself to take advantage of potential climate change opportunities by acquiring renewable energy sources through the acquisition of two ethanol production facilities  thereby achieving a lower 
table of contents carbon footprint and an enhanced capability to meet governmental fuel standards 
the company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  or the cost impact of natural catastrophic events resulting from climate change  if it occurs  will be in future periods 
environmental stewardship the company recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship as a core component of its mission as a responsible international energy company and has implemented sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to capture and process environmental  safety and climate change related information 
as a companion to murphy s worldwide ehs policy  the company s web site also contains a statement on climate change 
not only does this statement on climate change include murphy s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis while growing its upstream and certain downstream operations  the information on the company s web site describes actions already taken to move towards that goal 
these efforts include incorporating climate change into the company s planning processes  reducing emissions  pursuing new opportunities and engaging legislative and regulatory entities externally 
in support of these efforts  worldwide greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted since additionally  murphy participates in the massachusetts institute of technology mit joint program on the science and policy of global change 
the initiatives cited above demonstrate the company s commitment regarding environmental issues  which are at the forefront of today s global public policy dialogue 
other matters the energy independence and security act eisa was signed into law in december the eisa  through epa regulation  requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production 
eisa greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the renewable fuels standard rfs which began in september murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as renewable identification numbers rins to meet most of its obligation 
on july   the rfs standard came into effect requiring the blending phase in of ethanol  biodiesel  cellulosic and advanced renewable fuels 
murphy is meeting its obligations for rfs primarily through the rins system 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in its operations 
under murphy s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed routinely 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
safety matters the company is subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in murphy s operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil 
table of contents prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant at times during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services in a strong oil price environment 
as noted elsewhere  oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile over the last several years 
oil prices have been strong in the last few years  while north american natural gas prices have been generally weakening due to oversupply of natural gas in this market 
oil prices in the current range of per barrel and above generally lead to strong demand for oil field services 
the prices for oil field goods and services generally rise in periods of higher oil prices and do not usually decline as significantly when oil and gas prices retreat 
should oil prices rise further in future periods  the company anticipates that prices for certain oil field equipment and services could rise sharply 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services 
accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the annual goodwill impairment assessment process by permitting a company to assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company would be required to conduct the current two step goodwill impairment test 
this change was effective for goodwill impairment tests beginning in the adoption of this standard in did not have a significant effect on murphy s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that only permits two options for presentation of comprehensive income 
comprehensive income can be presented in a a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  including total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income  or b in two separate but continuous statements for the statement of income and the statement of comprehensive income 
the new guidance was effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance in did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued a new rule that requires additional disclosures for reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
these additional disclosures include changes in aoci balances by component and significant items reclassified out of aoci 
these disclosures must be presented either on the face of the affected financial statement or in the notes to the financial statements 
the disclosures are effective for murphy beginning in the first quarter of and are to be provided on a prospective basis 
the united states congress passed the dodd frank act the act in as mandated by the act  the us securities and exchange commission sec has recently issued rules regarding annual disclosures for purchases of conflict minerals and payments made to the us federal and all foreign governments by extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
these two rules are described below 
conflict minerals are defined as tin  tantalum  tungsten and gold which originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country 
the company is currently investigating whether its activities will require an annual conflict minerals filing 
if applicable  the first annual report for conflict minerals must be filed by may  for the calendar year of due to its activities as a worldwide exploration company and a producer of oil and natural gas in several countries  the company will be required to report annual payments made to the us federal and all foreign governments 
the recent sec rules require disclosures of a the type and total amount of payments made for each project associated with extraction activities  and b the type and total amount of payments made to each government 
the types of payments covered by the rules include taxes  royalties  fees  production entitlements  bonuses and other material benefits that are part of the commonly recognized revenue stream 
table of contents for oil and gas companies 
the annual disclosure filing must be made within days of the fiscal year end may  for the filing and will first be required for fiscal years ending after september  the transition rules for allow murphy s first filing to disclose payments for the period from october to december  the oil and gas industry has challenged in us federal court the rules set forth by the sec 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this court challenge 
significant accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below 
proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves are defined by the sec as those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether a deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well  or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require the company to use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining quantities of proved reserves 
these historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserves quantities 
reserves revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
downward reserves revisions can also lead to significant impairment expense 
the company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserves revisions that will be required in future periods 
the company s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages f and f of this form k 
murphy has utilized reliable geologic and engineering technology in and to include proved undeveloped reserves more than one location from producing wells in the more developed portions of the eagle ford shale 
the study incorporated public and proprietary data from multiple sources and encompassed the entire basin 
this included analysis of seismic data  well log data  test production and fluids properties to establish geologic consistency as well as significant statistical performance data yielding predictable and repeatable reserves estimates within certain analogous areas 
these locations were limited to only those areas with both established geologic consistency and sufficient statistical performance data where such data could be demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results 
oil proved reserves revisions proved oil reserves in the us had positive revisions in which arose from improved performance in the eagle ford shale area and at the medusa field in the gulf of mexico 
negative conventional proved oil reserves revisions in canada in occurred due to a lower recovery assessment for certain wells drilled in 
table of contents the seal heavy oil area in western canada 
negative synthetic oil reserves revisions in at syncrude were related to a change in entitlement that increased government royalties based on a recent projection for future operating and capital spending 
the negative proved oil reserves revision in republic of the congo was associated with poor well performance  a well that prematurely went off production  and generally uneconomic remaining future production levels 
in  positive proved oil reserves revisions in the us were primarily associated with better production at the medusa field in the gulf of mexico 
positive revisions for oil reserves of conventional operations in canada were mostly attributable to better well performance at the hibernia field  offshore eastern canada 
synthetic oil operations had positive reserves revisions in due to a change in royalty rate 
positive oil reserves revisions in in malaysia were primarily attributable to better production performance at the kikeh field 
positive oil reserves revisions in the uk in were associated with the schiehallion field which is being redeveloped by its owners 
the negative revision in oil reserves in republic of the congo in was attributable to poor production results for wells in the field 
in  a positive revision in us proved oil reserves was primarily associated with better than anticipated performance of wells at the thunder hawk and medusa fields in the gulf of mexico 
better well performance at the hibernia and terra nova fields led to favorable proved oil reserves revisions in canada in proved oil reserves for canadian synthetic oil operations had a positive revision in primarily due to a lower royalty 
the positive proved oil reserves revision in malaysia in primarily related to better well performance at the kikeh field 
a positive proved oil reserves revision in republic of the congo in was attributable to improved terms under the production sharing agreement that allocated a larger share of production at the azurite field to the account of the company beginning in october natural gas proved reserves revisions proved natural gas reserves in the us had positive revisions during due to improved well performance at several fields in the gulf of mexico  plus better well performance in the eagle ford shale area 
proved natural gas reserves in canada were revised downward in due to weaker average monthly natural gas prices in the current year that adversely affected certain areas in the montney formation of western canada 
proved natural gas reserves in malaysia in had positive revisions due to better well performance and favorable entitlement effects for gas operations offshore sarawak 
in  proved natural gas reserves in the us had negative revisions due to well performance being less than expected in early wells drilled in the gas prone regions of the eagle ford shale in south texas 
positive gas reserves revisions in canada in were primarily at the tupper and tupper west areas based on better than anticipated well performance 
negative gas reserves revisions in malaysia in were primarily due to higher sales prices which effectively reduced the entitlement percentage for future production at the sarawak gas fields 
negative gas reserves revisions in the uk in were essentially caused by revised estimate of gas cap volumes at the mungo monan field 
in  proved natural gas reserves in the us had positive revisions due to better well performance at the thunder hawk and mondo fields in the gulf of mexico 
the positive gas reserves revision in canada in was attributable to performance at various wells in the tupper area of british columbia 
proved reserves of natural gas in malaysia were revised downward in due to higher prices leading to a lower future entitlement percentage for the company 
positive gas reserves revisions in the uk in were attributable to better well performance at all gas producing fields 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves cannot be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
under current accounting rules  the company holds well costs in property  plant and equipment in the 
table of contents consolidated balance sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
in  a well in the mpn block offshore republic of the congo was expensed 
this well had been drilled in late and was held until another well nearby could be drilled  the nearby well was unsuccessfully drilled in also in  two wells drilled offshore sarawak in were expensed following local government denial of a request to extend the oil development period for these wells 
additionally in  a well drilled in the gulf of mexico in was expensed following the owners decision not to develop the well 
in  a dry hole was recorded for a well drilled in republic of the congo in a significant reduction in proved oil reserves at the azurite field in the same mps block during reduced the likelihood of this well being produced in future years 
in  a dry hole was recorded for a well in the north sea that was drilled in extensive evaluations of this oil discovery determined in that recovery of hydrocarbons was not economical in the current price environment 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  future margins on refined products or ethanol products produced and sold  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a long lived asset for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable revisions of oil or natural gas reserves  expected deterioration of future margins for refining  marketing or ethanol production operations  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in assessing potential impairment involving refining  marketing and ethanol production assets  the company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events  which include projections of future margins  future capital expenditures and future operating expenses 
future marketing or operating decisions  such as closing or selling certain assets  and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the company s conclusion about potential asset impairment 
the company recorded impairment expense in of million for the azurite field  offshore republic of the congo  and million for the hereford  texas ethanol production facility 
the congo impairment was necessitated by removal of all proved oil reserves at azurite following an unsuccessful redrill of a well  this result led to 
table of contents uneconomic future oil production operations for the field 
the hereford impairment was based on an expectation of continued weak future ethanol margins at the production facility 
the hereford impairment was determined using available years of futures prices for corn and ethanol  plus a terminal value based on a reasonable multiple of the final year s cash flow 
impairment expense of million was recognized in to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field  offshore republic of the congo  to fair value 
the expense was necessitated by a significant year end reduction of proved oil reserves at this field which was caused by poor well performance 
based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end  the company does not believe it had any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date 
the expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods 
these quoted prices often reflect higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the time of assessment 
if quoted prices for future years had been lower  the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in in addition  one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices  lower future production  higher future costs  lower future margins on refining and marketing and ethanol sales  or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property  equipment and inventories  and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h and pm in malaysia and blocks mps and mpn in republic of the congo  for exploration licenses in certain areas  the largest of which are australia  indonesia and brunei  and for certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
during  the company recognized us tax benefits related to exploration activities in republic of the congo and suriname that totaled million 
these us benefits arose due to tax deductions for worthless stock investments in these countries 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
the company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired us employees 
the expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries 
the most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the retiree medical and insurance plans  the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
discount rates are based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available within each country 
cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans 
the discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country 
expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics 
anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs 

table of contents based on bond yields at december   the company has used a discount rate of at year end and beyond for the primary us plans 
the year end discount rate is lower than a year earlier  this reduced rate led to an increase in the company s recorded liabilities for retirement plans compared to a year ago 
although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary us plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current year s retirement plan expenses from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations 
the company s normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses  excluding special termination benefits  are expected to increase slightly in compared to based on the effects of a growing employee base 
in  the company paid million into various retirement plans and million into postretirement plans 
in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines  the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return  or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected 
although congress recently passed the moving ahead for progress in the st century act that permits certain companies to reduce retirement plan contributions in the near term  this act does not reduce the company s overall funding requirements in the long term 
as described above  the company s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions  primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets 
a decline in the discount rate would increase annual retirement and postretirement expenses by million and million  respectively  and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase retirement expense by million 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments  and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligations millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating and other lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities  including debt interest total the company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields 
in addition  the company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section 
the company s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above 

table of contents in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amounts of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods are shown below 
amount of commitments millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end included operating leases of floating  production  storage and offloading vessels fpso for the kikeh and azurite oil fields  operating leases for production facilities at the thunder hawk and west patricia fields and for certain land and or fueling stations in the uk and uk  drilling contracts for onshore and offshore rigs in various countries  and oil and or natural gas transportation contracts in the us and western canada 
the leases call for future monthly net lease payments through at thunder hawk  through at west patricia and azurite and through at kikeh 
the uk and uk fueling stations require monthly payments mostly over the next years 
the us and western canada transportation contracts require minimum monthly payments through future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown on the preceding page 
in november  the field s operator executed a year lease for a semi floating production system at the kakap gumusut field offshore sabah  malaysia 
this lease will become effective when the construction of the system is certified as complete  which is expected to occur in although not legally liable under the lease until completion of construction and sail away  the company has included the expected lease obligations for this production system in the contractual obligation table shown on the preceding page 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
the price for crude oil is primarily affected by the level of demand for energy 
in january  west texas intermediate crude oil traded in a band between and per barrel 
nymex natural gas traded in a band of to per mmbtu during this same time 
us retail marketing margins in january were squeezed by higher wholesale gasoline prices and weaker seasonal driver demand for motor fuel products during this period 
the company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending based on these prices 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and based on this budget capital expenditures in are expected to be comparable to levels 
since the budget was approved by the company s board of directors  crude oil prices have generally been above the levels assumed in the budget  but north american natural gas prices have generally trailed the budgeted prices 
capital expenditures in are projected to total approximately billion 
of this amount  billion or about  is allocated for the exploration and production program 
geographically  e p capital is spread approximately as follows for the united states  for malaysia  for canada and for all other areas 
spending in the us is primarily associated with development and exploration programs in the eagle ford shale area of south texas 
in malaysia  the majority of the spending is for continued development of the kikeh  kakap and siakap fields in block k and oil development projects offshore sarawak in blocks sk and sk canadian spending is primarily related to continued development of the seal heavy oil area and syncrude 
refining and marketing expenditures in are budgeted at about million  or of the company total  with the bulk of this spending allocated to construction of additional us retail gasoline stations 
capital and other expenditures will 
table of contents be routinely reviewed during and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year 
capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases  which often are not anticipated at the time the budget is prepared 
the company will primarily fund its capital program in using operating cash flow  but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities 
the company s budget calls for borrowings of long term debt during the year to fund a portion of the capital program 
if oil and or natural gas prices weaken  actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such that higher than anticipated borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the company s ongoing development projects 
additionally  the budget assumes further share repurchases under the previously announced share buyback program of up to billion 
the level of these share repurchases is expected to influence the amount of borrowings under credit facilities during the company currently expects production in to average about  barrels of oil equivalent per day  a increase compared to a key assumption in projecting the level of company production is the anticipated ramp up of crude oil and natural gas production in the eagle ford shale area of south texas  where a major drilling and completion operation is ongoing with ten rigs in use 
another key factor in meeting production targets is the rate of decline of natural gas wells at the tupper area in western canada 
the company significantly reduced development drilling operations in this area in and early due to depressed prices for canadian natural gas production 
due to the drilling cut back  natural gas production in the tupper area will decline in other key assumptions necessary to achieve the anticipated production levels include continued reliability of production at significant operations such as kikeh  syncrude  hibernia and terra nova and the continued demand for natural gas from our offshore malaysia fields 
the company s budget anticipates an increase for overall hydrocarbon extraction costs by about on a barrel of oil equivalent basis 
production costs in are projected to increase due to expected higher costs for synthetic oil operations at syncrude caused by more spend on environmental and other regulatory matters  plus an unfavorable effect from a lower mix of tupper area gas production  which is historically near the lowest cost per barrel equivalent produced by the company 
the overall per unit depreciation rate for oil and gas operations is anticipated to rise in due to ongoing capital development costs at kikeh  the seal heavy oil area and terra nova 
additionally  there is an unfavorable effect on the overall depreciation rate in from a lower mix of natural gas production in the tupper area of canada 
the company has announced that it plans to exit the uk refining and marketing business 
the sale process for this uk r m business continues to progress in early in  the company announced its intention to separate its us downstream operations into a stand alone publicly owned company 
at the present time  this separation is expected to be completed in the company also announced in that it would sell its uk oil and gas production assets  the sales are expected to be completed in early further  the company announced a stock repurchase program of up to billion 
through year end  the company had funded a million accelerated share repurchase program with a major financial institution 
after the anticipated separation of the us downstream subsidiary from murphy oil corporation during  and the desired sale of the uk downstream business  the company is expected to be fundamentally different 
the company will have significantly lower sales revenue as the us and us downstream businesses generated about of murphy s consolidated revenue in for the year of  the combined us and uk downstream businesses generated about of operating income from continuing operations before considering unallocated corporate net costs 
also  the two downstream businesses made up about of the company s workforce at year end the company also anticipates that without these downstream operations  it may no longer qualify as a member of the fortune group of companies 
murphy oil is anticipated to be an independent oil and gas company in the future and will not have a significant refining and marketing business as a diversification to its oil and gas business 
this decrease in size and change in diversification could impact its credit rating  and could  although not expected to  impact its ability to repay long term debt obligations when due

risk factors  which begins on page of this annual report on form k 
murphy undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements  there were short term commodity derivative contracts in place at december  to hedge the purchase price of corn and the sales prices of wet and dried distillers grain at the company s ethanol production facilities in hankinson  north dakota  and hereford  texas 
a increase in the respective benchmark price of the commodities underlying these derivative contracts would have decreased the recorded net asset associated with these derivative contracts by approximately million  while a decrease would have increased the recorded net asset by a similar amount 
changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the changes in the value for an equivalent volume of these feedstocks 
also as described in note k  there were short term derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at december  to hedge the value of us dollar based receivables against the canadian dollar 
a strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar would have increased the recorded net liability associated with these contracts by approximately million  while a weakening of the us dollar would have reduced the recorded net liability by approximately million 
changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the financial statement impact of an equivalent volume of foreign currency exposures associated with other assets and or liabilities
