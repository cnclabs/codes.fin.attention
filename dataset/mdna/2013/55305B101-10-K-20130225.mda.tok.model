application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed  the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer  and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  home closings financed by third parties  and all home closings insured under federal housing administration fha  us veterans administration va and other government insured programs are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings initially funded by our owned subsidiary  m i financial corp 
m i financial  is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination  and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized interest  real estate taxes  indirect costs  and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
sales incentives  including pricing discounts and financing costs paid by the company  are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the company consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives in the form of options or upgrades are recorded in homebuilding costs 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and or related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the fair value of the guarantee is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered  and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventory 
inventory is recorded at cost  unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land is impaired  at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  property  plant and equipment 
inventory includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction  and common costs that benefit the entire community  less impairments  if any 
land acquisition  land development and common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred are typically allocated to individual lots based on the total number of lots expected to be closed in each community or phase or the relative sales value of each lot 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community or phase are allocated proportionately to the homes remaining in the community or phase and homes previously closed 
the cost of individual lots is transferred to homes under construction when home construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a specific identification basis 
costs of home closings include the specific construction cost of the home and the allocated lot costs 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimates by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete a home in the future could differ from our estimates  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
the company assesses inventory for recoverability on a quarterly basis if events or changes in local or national economic conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in conducting our quarterly review for indicators of impairment on a community level  we evaluate  among other things  margins on sales contracts in backlog  the margins on homes that have been delivered  expected changes in margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community  expected changes in margins with regard to future land sales  the value of the land itself as well as any results from third party appraisals 
from the review of all of these factors  we identify communities whose carrying values may exceed their estimated undiscounted future cash flows and run a test for recoverability 
for those communities whose carrying values exceed the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and which are deemed to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the communities exceeds the estimated fair value 
due to the fact that the company cash flow models and estimates of fair values are based upon management estimates and assumptions  unexpected changes in market conditions and or changes in management intentions with respect to the inventory may lead the company to incur additional impairment charges in the future 
for all of the categories listed below  the key assumptions relating to the valuations are dependent on project specific local market and or community conditions and are inherently uncertain 
because each inventory asset is unique  there are numerous inputs and assumptions used in our valuation techniques 
market factors that may impact these assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales pace  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors market and or community presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  and current economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other market factors that may impact project assumptions are considered by personnel in our homebuilding divisions as they prepare or update the forecasts for each community 
quantitative and qualitative factors other than home sales prices could significantly impact the potential for future impairments 
the sales objectives can differ between communities  even within a given sub market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
furthermore  the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in home sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace or a reduction in base house costs 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated average selling price  construction and development costs  absorption pace  selling strategies  or discount rates  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
as of december   our projections generally assume a gradual improvement in market conditions 
if communities are not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the fair value of a community is estimated by discounting management cash flow projections using an appropriate risk adjusted interest rate 
as of december   we utilized discount rates ranging from to in our valuations 
the discount rate used in determining each asset estimated fair value reflects the inherent risks associated with the related estimated cash flow stream  as well as current risk free rates available in the market and estimated market risk premiums 
for example  construction in progress inventory  which is closer to completion  will generally require a lower discount rate than land under development in communities consisting of multiple phases spanning several years of development 
operating communities 
if an indicator for impairment exists for existing operating communities  the recoverability of assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales 
these estimated cash flows are developed based primarily on management assumptions relating to the specific community 
the significant assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of assets include the timing of development and or marketing phases  projected sales price and sales pace of each existing or planned community  the estimated land development  home construction  and selling costs of the community  overall market supply and demand  the local market  and competitive conditions 
management reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
we believe the most critical assumptions in the company cash flow models are projected absorption pace for home sales  sales prices  and costs to build and deliver homes on a community by community basis 
in order to estimate the assumed absorption pace for home sales included in the company cash flow models  the company analyzes the historical absorption pace in the community as well as other communities in the geographic area 
in addition  the company considers internal and external market studies and trends  which may include  but are not limited to  statistics on population demographics  unemployment rates  foreclosure sales  and availability of competing products in the geographic area where a community is located 
when analyzing the company historical absorption pace for home sales and corresponding internal and external market studies  the company places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the absorption pace realized in its most recent quarters and management most current assessment of sales pace 
in order to estimate the sales prices included in its cash flow models  the company considers the historical sales prices realized on homes it delivered in the community and other communities in the geographic area  as well as the sales prices included in its current backlog for such communities 
in addition  the company considers internal and external market studies and trends  which may include  but are not limited to  statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities  which include the impact of short sales  if any  and sales prices on similar products in non neighboring communities in the geographic area where the community is located 
when analyzing its historical sales prices and corresponding market studies  the company places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the sales prices realized in its most recent quarters and the sales prices in current backlog 
based upon this analysis  the company sets a sales price for each house type in the community which it believes will achieve an acceptable gross margin and sales pace in the community 
this price becomes the price published to the sales force for use in its sales efforts 
the company then considers the average of these published sales prices when estimating the future sales prices in its cash flow models 
in order to arrive at the company assumed costs to build and deliver homes  the company generally assumes a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with its vendors and subcontractors  adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure 
with respect to overhead included in the cash flow models  the company uses forecasted rates included in the company annual budget adjusted for actual experience 
future communities 
if an indicator of impairment exists for raw land  land under development  or lots that management anticipates will be utilized for future homebuilding activities  the recoverability of assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales  consistent with the evaluations performed for operating communities discussed above 
for raw land  land under development  or lots that management intends to market for sale to a third party  but that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as land held for sale as discussed below  the estimated fair value of the assets is determined based on either the estimated net sales proceeds expected to be realized on the sale of the assets or the estimated fair value determined using cash flow valuation techniques 
if the company has not yet determined whether raw land  land under development  or lots will be utilized for future homebuilding activities or marketed for sale to a third party  the company assesses the recoverability of the inventory using a probability weighted approach 
land held for sale 
land held for sale includes land that meets all of the following six criteria management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated  the sale of the asset is probable  and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year  the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
the company records land held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions  market analysis and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties  as well as actual contracts 
if the estimated fair value less the costs to sell an asset is less than the asset current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
our quarterly assessments reflect management best estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainties in management estimates and uncertainties related to our operations and our industry as a whole as further discussed in item a 
risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k  we are unable to determine at this time if and to what extent continuing future impairments will occur 
additionally  due to the volume of possible outcomes that can be generated from changes in the various model inputs for each community  we do not believe it is possible to create a sensitivity analysis that can provide meaningful information for the users of our financial statements 
variable interest entities 
in order to minimize our investment and risk of land exposure in a single location  we have periodically partnered with other land developers or homebuilders to share in the land investment and development of a property through joint ownership and development agreements  joint ventures  and other similar arrangements 
for such joint venture arrangements where a special purpose entity is established to own the property  we enter into limited liability company arrangements llcs with the other partners to develop the land 
the company ownership interest in these entities as of december  ranged from to 
these entities typically engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing or selling developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
with respect to our investments in these entities  we are required  under asc  consolidation asc to evaluate whether or not such entities should be consolidated into our financial statements 
we initially perform these evaluations when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity 
in order to determine if we should consolidate an llc  we determine if the llc is a variable interest entity vie and if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
factors considered are whether we have the ability to control the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance 
such activities include  but are not limited to the ability to determine the budget and scope of land development work  if any  the ability to control financing decisions for the vie  the ability to acquire additional land into the vie or dispose of land in the vie not under contract with m i homes  and the ability to change or amend the existing option contract with the vie 
if it is determined we are not able to control such activities  we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the vie 
if we have the ability to control such activities  we will continue our analysis by determining if we are also expected to benefit from or absorb a potentially significant amount of the vie expected gains or losses  respectively 
as of december   we have determined that one of the unconsolidated llcs in which we have an interest meets the requirements of a vie due to a lack of equity at risk in the entity 
all of our other entities had sufficient equity at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors 
however  we have determined that we do not have substantive control over any of these entities  including our vie 
as a result  none of these entities are required to be consolidated into our financial statements and the entities are instead recorded in investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies on our consolidated balance sheets 
we enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we also analyze these agreements under asc to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie  if applicable  using an analysis similar to that described above 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
please see the off balance sheet arrangements section below and note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
in cases where we are the primary beneficiary  even though we do not have title to such land  we are required to consolidate these purchase option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as consolidated inventory not owned in our consolidated balance sheets 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable line item in our consolidated statements of operations or our consolidated balance sheets  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
m i financial provides a limited life guarantee on loans sold to certain third parties and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
the company has also provided certain other guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the purchase and development of land  including guarantees of the completion of land development 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the estimated cost of insurance coverage or estimated cost of acquiring a bond in the amount of the exposure 
actual future costs associated with these guarantees and indemnities could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
warranty reserves 
we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are  during applicable warranty periods  ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs 
as such  we record warranty reserves to cover our exposure to the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors to the extent they relate to warranty type claims 
warranty reserves are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty reserve for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs described above under the company warranty programs 
reserves are recorded for warranties under the following warranty programs home builder s limited warranty hblw  and year transferable structural warranty the warranty reserves for hblw are established as a percentage of average sales price and adjusted based on historical payment patterns determined  generally  by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the hblw reserves include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience and differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty reserve balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount 
our warranty reserves for our transferable structural warranty programs are established on a per unit basis 
while the structural warranty reserve is recorded as each house closes  the sufficiency of the structural warranty per unit charge and total reserve is re evaluated on an annual basis  with the assistance of an actuary  using our own historical data and trends  as well as industry wide historical data and trends  and other project specific factors 
the reserves are also evaluated quarterly and adjusted if we encounter activity that is not consistent with the historical experience used in the annual analysis 
these reserves are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding structural defect claims for products we build  the markets in which we build  claim settlement history  insurance and legal interpretations  among other factors 
while we believe that our warranty reserves are sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
self insurance reserves 
self insurance reserves are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  workers compensation  and general liability insurance 
for  our self insurance limit for employee health care was  per claim per year  with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of  our workers compensation claims are insured by a third party and carry a deductible of  per claim  except for claims made in the state of ohio where the company is self insured 
our self insurance limit for ohio workers compensation is  per claim  with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the reserves related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open case reserves 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million completed operations construction defect deductible per occurrence by division and a million deductible in the aggregate  with a  deductible for all other types of claims 
the company records a general liability reserve for claims falling below the company deductible 
the general liability reserve estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims  other industry specific factors and specific event analysis 
the company recorded expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for all self insured and general liability claims during  and for the year ended december   this included million of charges related to defective drywall  as well as the million settlement received in the third quarter of related to defective drywall 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation by recognizing compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based awards granted under compensation arrangements 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected term of the awards 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
derivative financial instruments 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
these irlcs are considered derivative financial instruments 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss  the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  and the occasional purchase of options on fmbss in accordance with company policy 
these fmbss  options on fmbss  and irlcs covered by fmbss are considered non designated derivatives 
in determining the fair value of irlcs  m i financial considers the value of the resulting loan if sold in the secondary market 
the fair value includes the price that the loan is expected to be sold for along with the value of servicing release premiums 
subsequent to inception  m i financial estimates an updated fair value  which is compared to the initial fair value 
in addition  m i financial uses fallout estimates  which fluctuate based on the rate of the irlc in relation to current rates 
gains or losses are recorded in financial services revenue 
certain irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale are committed to third party investors through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments 
the irlcs and related best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  which generally are highly effective from an economic standpoint  are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value  with gains or losses recorded in financial services revenue 
under the terms of these best efforts whole loan delivery commitments covering mortgage loans held for sale  the specific committed mortgage loans held for sale are identified and matched to specific delivery commitments on a loan by loan basis 
the delivery commitments and loans held for sale are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in financial services revenue 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we evaluate our deferred tax assets  including the benefit from nols  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
companies must assess  using significant judgments  whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the length of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating losses and our experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
based upon a review of all available evidence  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during we continue to maintain a full non cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of our remaining net deferred tax assets at december  as we have determined that the weight of the negative evidence exceeds that of the positive evidence and it continues to be more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets and nol carryovers 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  against deferred tax assets which include the tax benefit from nol carryovers 
at december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and federal credit carryforwards of million and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
our future deferred tax asset realization depends on sufficient taxable income in the carryforward periods under existing tax laws 
our federal carryforward benefits will begin to expire in our state net operating loss benefits began to expire in  with million expiring between and and million expiring between and we will continue to review on an ongoing basis all available evidence to determine if and when we expect to realize our deferred tax assets and nol carryovers 
additionally  due to the considerable estimates utilized in establishing a valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to either increase or decrease our valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
results of operations the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
the company s chief operating decision makers evaluate the company s performance in various ways  including the results of our individual homebuilding operating segments and the results of our financial services operations  the results of our three homebuilding regions  and our consolidated financial results 
we have determined our reportable segments as follows midwest homebuilding  southern homebuilding  mid atlantic homebuilding and financial services operations 
the homebuilding operating segments that are included within each reportable segment have similar operations and exhibit similar long term economic characteristics 
our homebuilding operations include the acquisition and development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes  and the occasional sale of lots to third parties 
the homebuilding operating segments that comprise each of our reportable segments are as follows midwest southern mid atlantic columbus  ohio tampa  florida washington  dc cincinnati  ohio orlando  florida charlotte  north carolina indianapolis  indiana houston  texas raleigh  north carolina chicago  illinois san antonio  texas austin  texas in april  we expanded our houston  texas operations by acquiring the assets of a privately held homebuilder 
in october  we announced our entry into the austin  texas market 
we expect to open our first community in our austin market in our financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title services primarily for purchasers of the company homes 
overview throughout  we and others in the homebuilding industry saw signs that the overall housing market is stabilizing and beginning to recover from the severe housing downturn that began in mid we are experiencing broad based improvement across all of our regions  which we believe is being driven by the decline in national housing inventory levels and stabilization in our markets resulting from attractive housing affordability levels  moderate changes in buyer perceptions  increased demand for distressed properties  and historically low interest rates for residential consumer mortgage loans 
this improvement is evident in our operating results for and our improved gross margins  operating margins and operating leverage statistics in compared to as more fully described below in our summary of company results in and our year over year comparisons 
summary of company results in summary of financial results we had net income of million  or per diluted share  for  our highest net income since  compared to a net loss of million in  or a loss of per diluted share 
our income in included a million settlement the company received in related to defective imported drywall  a million increase in land sale profit and a million decrease in impairment charges taken during compared to other contributing factors are described below 
in  total revenue was million  an increase of from we earned million in revenue from homes delivered  million in revenue from land sales and million in revenue from our financial services operation 
revenue from homes delivered increased driven primarily by the additional homes delivered in compared to a increase and by a increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  per home delivered 
revenue from land sales increased million from due primarily to one large land sale in revenue in our financial services segment increased from million in primarily due to an increase in the number of loan originations and an increase in the average loan amount from  in to  in also contributing to the increase in our financial services revenue was million in revenue in from retaining mortgage servicing rights and an increase in revenue from our refinance business when compared to total gross margin increased million in when compared to the increase was largely the result of a million improvement in our homebuilding operations with the remainder due to our financial services operations 
with respect to our homebuilding operations  the improvement was primarily due to a decline in asset impairment charges described above and an million increase in housing gross margin when compared to the increase in housing gross margin resulted from the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  per home delivered and the unit increase in homes delivered 
the increased sales prices were driven primarily by continued performance in our new communities  the strategic shift in our geographic footprint  which resulted in more homes delivered in our better performing markets  a shift in the mix of homes delivered to higher priced and larger homes and improving market conditions  allowing for more pricing leverage in select locations and submarkets 
the pricing and unit improvements were partially offset by higher construction costs related to both the mix of homes delivered as well as cost increases associated with improving housing industry market conditions and normal supply and demand dynamics 
in  we were able to pass a portion of the higher construction costs to our homebuyers in the form of higher sales prices and lower incentives and believe we will be able to continue to do so in  if any 
selling  general and administrative expense increases of million in offset  in part  our increase in gross margin discussed above 
selling expenses increased million to million from million in but declined as a percent of revenue to in from in variable selling expense for sales commissions contributed million to the increase due to the increase in the number of homes delivered and the higher average sales price 
the increase in selling expense was also attributable to the million increase in our sales office and model costs resulting from the increase in our number of communities  and a million non recurring expense primarily related to our early exit from rental space in the midwest 
general and administrative costs increased million  from million in to million in but declined as a percent of revenue from in to in this increase was primarily due to an increase in share based and variable compensation expense related to the improvement in our operating performance in versus  an increase in our expense for mortgage loans indemnifications as a result of a settlement and expenses incurred in connection with our investments in our new houston and austin markets that were under leveraged from a revenue perspective in  which is typical of a new market 
overall  our selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue in compared to in we expect to be able to continue to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in as we open new communities and the housing market continues to improve 
interest expense for the company increased million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in our weighted average borrowings from million in to million in partially offset  by a decline in our weighted average borrowing rate from in to in and higher capitalization of interest in the increase in weighted average borrowings was primarily the result of the increase in borrowings under the mif mortgage warehousing agreement as a result of an increase in the number of loan originations during along with the issuance of the additional million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the second quarter of and the issuance of the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in the third quarter of we reported an effective tax rate of in compared to for the change in our effective tax rate for is related to a million benefit recorded during the first quarter of reflecting the favorable outcome of certain prior year tax positions 
the effective rates are not reflective of our historical tax rate or our effective tax rate in future periods due to our full deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
summary of operational results in addition to the improving financial results noted above  our operational metrics also generally improved 
we achieved a increase in our new contracts  a increase in the number of homes in our backlog  and a increase in the overall sales value of our backlog in compared to furthermore  we continue to invest in new communities defined as communities opened after january  and markets that we believe are helping us in attaining improved profitability as housing markets improve and in enhancing our ability to establish market share and create a platform for future growth in our current markets 
during  we opened new communities and closed legacy communities 
we are experiencing higher gross margins  over basis points on average  in our new communities compared to our legacy communities 
of our homes delivered during  were in new communities  compared to during we believe our homebuilding operations are continuing to improve and be our primary driver of profitability  fueled by our land acquisitions and increasing operating leverage due to higher absorption rates per community and overall deliveries 
outlook looking ahead  we believe that the homebuilding industry will continue to gradually improve 
given this expectation  and consistent with our focus on improving long term returns  we will continue to emphasize the following strategic business objectives in profitably growing our presence in our existing markets  strategically investing in new markets  maintaining a strong balance sheet  and emphasizing customer service  product design  and premier locations 
with these objectives and improving market conditions in mind  we took a number of steps in to position the company for continued improvement in and beyond  including expanding our presence in texas by acquiring the assets of a privately held homebuilder in houston and entering into  and purchasing our first community in  the austin market 
we also invested million in land acquisition and million in land development in to help grow our presence in our existing markets 
we plan to spend approximately million on land purchases and approximately million on land development in we ended with over  lots under control  a increase from our approximately  lots under control at the end of we also opened new communities and closed legacy communities in  ending the year with a total of communities 
by the end of  we expect to increase our community count by over from our community count at the end of we also improved our liquidity in by raising million from our concurrent issuances in september of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes and million of our common shares along with million from our issuance in may of an additional million of our senior notes 
additionally  we placed significant attention in on investing in our product designs by reintroducing our showcase collection  a product line that appeals to luxury homebuyers in upscale communities  focusing on training our sales personnel in connection with the launch of our get more marketing program  and enhancing our models and design centers  including launching our stylesmart design concepts  which we believe will aid in the marketing of our products and differentiate us from our competition 
in  we plan to build upon the steps taken in we believe the actions taken in have helped  and the actions we plan to take in will help  position us  both operationally and financially  to build on the momentum generated from our return to profitability in given the value in our year end backlog and improving market conditions  we believe that our leverage and profitability will improve in when compared to despite our positive expectations  it is unclear whether our gross margin percentages will continue to improve as they have the past two years or whether our financial services operations will experience the same favorable operating results as in going forward  we believe our ability to leverage our fixed costs  obtain land at projected rates of return  and our planned new communities provide our best opportunities to continue improving our gross margin percentages

management found these measures to be useful in evaluating the company performance in and because they disclosed the financial results generated from homes the company actually delivered during the period  as the asset impairments and certain other write offs relate  in part  to inventory that was not delivered during the period and the impact on such gaap measures in those years was material 
we have presented non gaap financial measures for for comparative purposes  however  the impact on gaap measures was less significant 
in and  they also assisted the company management in making strategic decisions regarding the company future operations 
the company believed investors found this information to be important and useful because they disclosed profitability measures that can be compared to a prior period without regard to the variability of asset impairments and certain other write offs  that were material in amount 
in addition  to the extent that the company competitors provided similar information  disclosure of these measures helped readers of the company financial statements compare the company profits in those years to the profits of its competitors with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period 
because these measures are not calculated in accordance with gaap  they may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of the company competitors due to potential differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded 
due to the significance of the gaap components excluded  such measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance measures prescribed by gaap

the improvement in our gross margin compared to was primarily due to the improvements in average sales price of homes delivered and number of homes delivered  a million profit from the sale of land and a million reduction in impairment charges taken

year ended december  compared to year ended december  midwest region 
for the year ended december   we had million of homebuilding revenue in our midwest region  a decrease of million  from the million of homebuilding revenue we had in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in homes delivered from  in to in  which was partially offset by a slight increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  our decline in homes delivered largely reflects our relatively low backlog level at the beginning of  reflecting the decline in new contracts we experienced in the latter eight months of following the april  expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit 
our midwest region had an operating loss of million for the year ended december   compared to operating income of million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in impairment charges as well as the decrease in revenue described above  partially offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and higher adjusted operating gross margins

homebuilding revenue in our mid atlantic region decreased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in  which was partially offset by a slight increase in the number of homes delivered  from homes in to homes in the decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a decline in homes delivered in our washington dc market in when compared to which has a higher average selling price than our north carolina markets 
despite the decrease in revenue from  our operating income in our mid atlantic region for the year ended december  was million the same as this was due to million of lower impairment charges in than as well as million lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
the lower expense level was due primarily to lower variable selling expenses  community opening costs and lower architectural expenses for new product in  offset in part by higher payroll related expenses  when compared to for the year ended december   there were million of impairment charges in our mid atlantic region  compared to million of impairment charges for the year ended december  excluding these impairment charges  our adjusted operating gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  the decline in adjusted operating gross margin percentage was due to a change in product mix in from the homes delivered in  which was partially offset by a greater percentage of our homes delivered coming from new communities where  on average  we experience higher gross margins

financial services 
for the year ended december   revenue from our mortgage and title operations increased million  from million during the year ended december  to million for  despite a decrease in the number of loan originations 
the primary reason for this was the increase in refinance business our financial services segment experienced in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we had an increase of million in operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was attributable to higher margins on the loans sold in compared to at december   m i financial provided financing services in all of our markets 
approximately of our homes delivered during that were financed were financed through m i financial  which was the same rate as in capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate up or down from quarter to quarter 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in payroll related expenses and a million decrease in selling expenses 
interest expense net 
interest expense for the company increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in our weighted average borrowing rate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   along with the increase in our weighted average borrowings from million in to million in  due primarily to the issuance of the senior notes in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources overview of capital resources and liquidity at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  with million of this amount comprised of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our balance of unrestricted cash and available borrowing options  including availability under the company million secured revolving credit facility the credit facility  and proceeds from home deliveries and other sources of liquidity  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs  investment in land and land development  construction of homes  planned capital spending  and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we routinely monitor current operational requirements  financial market conditions  and credit relationships and we may choose to issue new debt and or equity securities as management deems necessary 
during the second quarter of  we repaid the remaining million aggregate principal balance of our senior notes at maturity on april  and also issued an additional million of our senior notes 
in september  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes and million common shares  for aggregate combined net proceeds of million 
during and  we made acquisitions of land assets to replenish our land inventories and to facilitate future growth in the markets in which we operate  including the acquisition of the assets of a privately held homebuilder based in houston  texas in april as a result of these land purchases and land development expenditures  combined with expenditures on home construction  interest  selling expenses  and general and administrative expenses  which in aggregate have exceeded our combined revenues from home deliveries and our financial services operations  we have used cash in operations in aggregate during this two year period 
our net income loss historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income loss and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  stock compensation awards and impairment losses for inventory  among other things 
at december  and  our ratio of net debt to net capital was and  respectively 
our ratio of net debt to net capital is calculated as total debt minus total cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  divided by the sum of total debt minus total cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash plus shareholders equity 
we believe that the ratio of net debt to net capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our operations and comparing us with other homebuilders 
operating cash flow activities during  we used million of cash in our operating activities  compared to cash used in operating activities of million in as is typical in the homebuilding industry  our primary uses of cash in operating our business during were for land purchases  land development expenditures  home construction  interest expense  selling expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
the primary source of cash was revenues from home deliveries  along with revenues from our financial services operations 
the net increase of million in cash used in operating activities during compared to was primarily due to the following a million increase in the net change in total inventory  an million decrease in impairment charges taken in compared to  a million decrease in the change in accounts payable and a million decrease in the change in other assets  offset  in part  by a million shift from a net loss of million in to net income of million in and favorable net changes in other liabilities million  accrued compensation million and customer deposits million 
due to our debt and equity offerings in and our net earnings in  we had the flexibility to invest capital to grow our operations in during  we spent million on land purchases and million on land development  for a total land spend of million compared to million in total land spend during in the normal course of our business  in addition to our land purchases  we have continued to enter into land option agreements  taking into consideration current and projected market conditions  in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we have deposits and prepaid acquisition costs totaling million as of december  as consideration for the right to purchase land and lots in the future  including the right to purchase million of land and lots during the years through based upon our business activity levels  liquidity  leverage  market conditions  and opportunities for land in our markets  we currently estimate that in  we will spend approximately million to million on land purchases and land development 
however  land transactions are subject to a number of factors  including our financial condition and market conditions 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and our ongoing pace of home deliveries and adjust our land spending accordingly 
the planned increase in our land spending in is driven primarily by our growth objectives and the ability of our divisions to contract for land in our markets on terms that meet our risk and return targets 
in addition  we expect a larger portion of our land investment will continue to shift from finished lot purchases to land acquisition and development  which will result in increased inventory levels 
over the past several years  the majority of our land investments have been purchases of finished lots in most of our markets 
in  we began increasing the amount of our investments in undeveloped land and our land development spending as the availability of finished lots in attractive locations declined in many of our markets 
investing cash flow activities during  we generated million of cash from investing activities  compared to using million of cash for investing activities in this increase was primarily due to the million reduction in restricted cash in compared to the million increase in restricted cash in the million reduction in restricted cash was primarily the result of the january  amendment to our credit facility the amendment  which is more fully described below in notes payable homebuilding 
as a result of the amendment  million of cash previously pledged to the lenders under the credit facility and included as restricted cash at december  was released 
at december   restricted cash consisted of homebuilding cash the company had pledged as collateral at december  in accordance with our secured letter of credit facilities 
see homebuilding letter of credit facilities below for more information regarding the letter of credit facilities 
financing cash flow activities during  we generated million of cash from our financing activities  compared to million during the increase in cash generated was primarily the result of the net proceeds of million received from our concurrent issuances of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes and million common shares in september  as well as our net proceeds received from our issuance of an additional million of our senior notes in may and a million increase in borrowings in our financial services operations 
these proceeds were partially offset by our repayment of the million aggregate outstanding principal balance of our senior notes during the second quarter of the financing needs of our homebuilding and financial services operations depend on anticipated sales volume in the current year as well as future years  inventory levels and related turnover  forecasted land and lot purchases  debt maturity dates  and other company plans 
we fund these operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  and  from time to time  issuances of new debt and or equity securities  as management deems necessary

make certain payments  including dividends  or repurchase any shares  in an aggregate amount exceeding our restricted payments basket  as defined in the indenture 
make investments in other entities  in the form of capital contributions or loans or purchases of securities  in an aggregate amount exceeding our restricted payments basket  except for certain permitted investments  which include  among other things  investments in subsidiaries or joint ventures that are not guarantors under the indenture  in an aggregate amount subsequent to the issue date not to exceed of consolidated tangible assets at any one time outstanding and other investments in an aggregate amount not to exceed million at any one time outstanding

as a result  we are permitted to make investments in addition to permitted investments and or to pay dividends on  and repurchase  our common shares and series a preferred shares to the extent of such positive balance 
see preferred shares below for more information 
weighted average borrowings 
in and  our weighted average borrowings outstanding were million and million  respectively  with a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
the increase in borrowings was primarily the result of the increase in borrowings under the mif mortgage warehousing agreement as a result of an increase in the number of loan originations during along with the issuance of the additional million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the second quarter of and the issuance of the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in the third quarter of at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
during  the average daily amount outstanding under the credit facility was million and the maximum amount outstanding under the credit facility was million 
we do not expect that we will incur additional borrowings under the credit facility during the first quarter of the actual amount borrowed will vary depending on various factors  including the timing and amount of land and house construction expenditures  payroll and other general and administrative expenses  and cash receipts from home closings  as well as other cash receipts and payments 
the company experiences significant variation in cash and credit facility balances from week to week due to the timing of such receipts and payments

borrowings outstanding at december  had a weighted average interest rate of 
interest payments by period will be based upon the outstanding borrowings and the applicable interest rate s in effect 
the above amounts do not reflect interest 
b the company is party to three land purchase agreements in which the company has specific performance requirements 
the future amounts payable related to these three land purchase agreements is the number of lots the company is obligated to purchase at the lot price set forth in the agreement 
the time period in which these payments will be made is the company best estimate at when these lots will be purchased 
c as of december   the company had obligations with certain subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials in the ordinary course of business to meet the commitment to deliver homes with an aggregate sales price of million 
based on our current housing gross margin  excluding the charge for impairment of inventory  less variable selling costs  less payments to date on homes in backlog  we estimate payments totaling approximately million to be made in relating to those homes 
d as of december   the company had options and contingent purchase agreements to acquire land and developed lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
purchase of properties is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the company and the sellers and therefore the timing of payments under these agreements is not determinable 
the company has no specific performance obligations with respect to these agreements 
e we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
as of december   we had no unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statue of limitations and completion of audits in prior years 
we believe that our current income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change 
off balance sheet arrangements reference is made to notes    and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these notes discuss our off balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items 
in addition  these notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations  including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated llcs  land option agreements  guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land  and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
our use of these arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
additionally  in the ordinary course of its business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
unconsolidated limited liability companies 
in order to minimize our investment and risk of land exposure in a single location  we periodically partner with other land developers or homebuilders to share in the land investment and development of a property through joint ownership and development agreements  joint ventures  and other similar arrangements 
for such joint venture partnerships where a special purpose entity is established to own the property  we enter into limited liability company arrangements unconsolidated llcs with the other partners to develop the land 
the company interest in these entities as of december  ranged from to 
these entities typically engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing or selling developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
the company is required to evaluate these unconsolidated llcs to determine whether they meet the criteria of a variable interest entity vie 
these evaluations are initially performed when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity 
if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary  we must first determine if we have the ability to control the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance 
such activities include  but are not limited to  the ability to determine the budget and scope of land development work  if any  the ability to control financing decisions for the vie  the ability to acquire additional land into the vie or dispose of land in the vie not under contract with m i homes  and the ability to change or amend the existing option contract with the vie 
if it is determined we are not able to control such activities  we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the vie 
if we do have the ability to control such activities  we will continue our analysis by determining if we are also expected to benefit from or absorb a potentially significant amount of the vie expected gains or losses  respectively 
as of december   we have determined that one of the unconsolidated llcs in which we have an interest meets the requirements of a vie due to a lack of equity at risk in the entity 
all of our other entities had sufficient equity at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors 
however  we have determined that we do not have substantive control over any of these entities  including our vie  therefore  they are recorded using the equity method of accounting and do not require consolidation into our financial statements 
we believe that the company maximum exposure related to its investment in these entities as of december  is the amount invested of million which includes a million note due to the company from one of the unconsolidated llcs  though we expect to invest further amounts in these llcs as development of the properties progresses 
further details relating to our unconsolidated llcs are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
land option agreements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company typically provides a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under the option agreement may meet the criteria for vies  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
at december  and  consolidated inventory not owned included million and million  respectively  under options contracts that were deemed to be vies and where we were considered the primary beneficiary of the vie 
of this balance  million and million  respectively  related to specific performance obligations 
at december  and  the corresponding liability of million and million  respectively  has been classified as obligation for consolidated inventory not owned on the consolidated balance sheets 
other than the consolidated inventory not owned balance  the company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of december  related to our land option agreements is equal to the amount of the company outstanding deposits and prepaid acquisition costs  which totaled million  including cash deposits of million  prepaid acquisition costs of million and letters of credit of million 
letters of credit and completion bonds 
the company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress  deposits on land and lot purchase agreements and miscellaneous deposits 
as of december   the company had outstanding million of completion bonds and standby letters of credit  some of which were issued to various local governmental entities  that expire at various times through february included in this total are million of performance bonds and million of performance letters of credit that serve as completion bonds for land development work in progress  million of financial letters of credit  and million of financial bonds 
the development agreements under which we are required to provide completion bonds or letters of credit are generally not subject to a required completion date and only require that the improvements are in place in phases as houses are built and sold 
in locations where development has progressed  the amount of development work remaining to be completed is typically less than the remaining amount of bonds or letters of credit due to timing delays in obtaining release of the bonds or letters of credit 
guarantees and indemnities 
in the ordinary course of business  m i financial enters into agreements that guarantee purchasers of its mortgage loans that m i financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur 
the risks associated with these guarantees are offset by the value of the underlying assets  and the company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans 
additionally  the company has provided certain other guarantees and indemnities in connection with the acquisition and development of land by our homebuilding operations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions within the united states and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates and inflation 
inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor can result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
higher interest rates also may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
rising interest rates  as well as increased materials and labor costs  may reduce gross margins 
an increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices 
conversely  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results typically  our homebuilding operations experience significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in general  homes delivered increase substantially in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
our financial services operations also experience seasonality because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  consisting of the credit facility  the mif mortgage warehousing agreement  and the mif mortgage repurchase facility which permit borrowings of up to million  subject to availability constraints 
additionally  m i financial is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services 
interest rate lock commitments interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to certain home buying customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlcs will have a duration of less than six months  however  in certain markets  the duration could extend to twelve months 
some irlcs are committed to a specific third party investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments matching the exact terms of the irlc loan 
uncommitted irlcs are considered derivative instruments and are fair value adjusted  with the resulting gain or loss recorded in current earnings 
forward sales of mortgage backed securities forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss are used to protect uncommitted irlc loans against the risk of changes in interest rates between the lock date and the funding date 
fmbss related to uncommitted irlcs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments and are recorded at fair value  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property 
during the intervening period between when a loan is closed and when it is sold to an investor  the interest rate risk is covered through the use of a best efforts contract or by fmbss 
the fmbss are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings
