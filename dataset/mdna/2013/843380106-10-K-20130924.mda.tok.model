item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview southern missouri bancorp  inc is a missouri corporation originally organized for the principal purpose of becoming the holding company of southern bank 
the principal business of southern bank consists of attracting deposits from the communities it serves and investing those funds in loans secured by one to four family residences and commercial real estate  as well as commercial business and consumer loans 
these funds have also been used to purchase investment securities  mortgage backed securities mbs  us government and federal agency obligations and other permissible securities 
southern bank s results of operations are primarily dependent on the levels of its net interest margin and noninterest income  and its ability to control operating expenses 
net interest margin is dependent primarily on the difference or spread between the average yield earned on interest earning assets including loans  mortgage related securities  and investments and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities including deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and borrowings  as well as the relative amounts of these assets and liabilities 
southern bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different times  or on a varying basis  from its interest bearing liabilities

additionally  southern bank is subject to policies and regulations issued by financial institution regulatory agencies including the federal reserve  the missouri division of finance  and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
each of these factors may influence interest rates  loan demand  prepayment rates and deposit flows 
interest rates available on competing investments as well as general market interest rates influence the bank s cost of funds 
lending activities are affected by the demand for real estate and other types of loans  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered

critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in item under the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the allowance for losses on loans represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans is increased by the provision for losses on loans charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for losses on loans is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experience  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
integral to the methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is portfolio segmentation and impairment measurement 
under the company s methodology  loans are first segmented into those comprising large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  including single family mortgages and installment loans  which are collectively evaluated for impairment and all other loans which are individually evaluated 
those loans in the second category are further segmented utilizing a defined grading system which involves categorizing loans by severity of risk based on conditions that may affect the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt  such as current financial information  collateral valuations  historical payment experience  credit documentation  public information  and current trends 
the loans subject to credit classification represent the portion of the portfolio subject to the greatest credit risk and where adjustments to the allowance for losses on loans as a result of provisions and charge offs are most likely to have a significant impact on operations 
a periodic review of selected credits based on loan size and type is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses and to assign risk grades 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the loan administration personnel 
this review is supplemented with periodic examinations of both selected credits and the credit review process by applicable regulatory agencies 
the information from these reviews assists management in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and provides a basis for deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk that should be recognized 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that southern bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans 
if the loan is not collateral dependent  the measurement of impairment is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate or the observable market price of the loan 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses the assumptions ie  discount rates and methodologies ie  comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
impairment identified through this evaluation process is a component of the allowance for loan losses 
if a loan that is individually evaluated for impairment is found to have none  it is grouped together with loans having similar characteristics ie  the same risk grade  and an allowance for loan losses is based upon a quantitative factor historical average charge offs for similar loans over the past one to five years  and qualitative factors such as qualitative factors such as changes in lending policies  national  regional  and local economic conditions  changes in mix and volume of portfolio  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  entry to new markets  levels and trends of delinquent  nonaccrual  special mention  and classified loans  concentrations of credit  changes in collateral values  agricultural economic conditions  and regulatory risk 
for portfolio loans that are evaluated for impairment as part of homogenous pools  an allowance is maintained based upon similar quantitative and qualitative factors 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for losses on loans and the associated provision for losses on loans

average net charge offs are calculated as net charge offs for the period by portfolio type as a percentage of the average balance of the respective portfolio type over the same period 
as the company and industry have seen increases in loan defaults in the past several years  the company believes that it is prudent to emphasize more recent historical factors in the allowance evaluation 
the following table sets forth the company s historical net charge offs as of june  net charge offs net charge offs portfolio segment year historical year historical real estate loans residential construction commercial consumer loans commercial loans additionally  in its quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company evaluates changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  changes in local  regional  and national economic conditions  the company s historical loss experience  and changes in market conditions for property pledged to the company as collateral 
the company has identified specific qualitative factors that address these issues and subjectively assigns a percentage to each factor 
qualitative factors are reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted as necessary to reflect improving or declining trends 
at june   these qualitative factors included changes in lending policies national  regional  and local economic conditions changes in mix and volume of portfolio experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff entry to new markets levels and trends of delinquent  nonaccrual  special mention and classified loans concentrations of credit changes in collateral values agricultural economic conditions regulatory risk the qualitative factors are applied to the allowance for loan losses based upon the following percentages by loan type qualitative factor qualitative factor applied at applied at portfolio segment june  june  real estate loans residential construction commercial consumer loans commercial loans at june   the amount of our allowance for loan losses attributable to these qualitative factors was approximately million  as compared to million at june  the general decrease in qualitative factors was attributable to an improving level of classified and delinquent loans  generally stable economic conditions  and other factors

while scheduled repayments on loans and securities as well as the maturity of short term investments are a relatively predictable source of funding  deposit flows  fhlb advance redemptions and loan and security prepayment rates are significantly influenced by factors outside of the bank s control  including general economic conditions and market competition 
the bank has relied on fhlb advances as a source for funding cash or liquidity needs

in total  fhlb borrowings are generally limited to of bank assets  or approximately million  which means that an amount up to million may still be eligible to be borrowed from the fhlb  subject to available collateral 
along with the ability to borrow from the fhlb and federal reserve  management believes its liquid resources will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs 
liquidity management is an ongoing responsibility of the bank s management 
the bank adjusts its investment in liquid assets based upon a variety of factors including i expected loan demand and deposit flows  ii anticipated investment and fhlb advance maturities  iii the impact on profitability  and iv asset liability management objectives

the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
average balance  interest and average yields and rates the table on the following page sets forth certain information relating to the company s average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and reflects the average yield on assets and the average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
these yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years indicated 
nonaccrual loans are included in the net loan category 
the table also presents information with respect to the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  or interest rate spread  which financial institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability 
another indicator of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets  which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest earning assets 
net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the goal of the company s asset liability management strategy is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
the company employs various strategies intended to manage the potential effect that changing interest rates may have on future operating results 
the primary asset liability management strategy has been to focus on matching the anticipated repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at times  however  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the company may increase its interest rate risk position in order to maintain its net interest margin 
in an effort to manage the interest rate risk resulting from fixed rate lending  the company has utilized longer term up to year maturities  fixed rate fhlb advances  which may be subject to early redemption  to offset interest rate risk 
other elements of the company s current asset liability strategy include i increasing originations of commercial real estate  commercial business loans  agricultural real estate  and agricultural operating lines  which typically provide higher yields and shorter repricing periods  but inherently increase credit risk  ii limiting the price volatility of the investment portfolio by maintaining a weighted average maturity of five years or less  iii actively soliciting less rate sensitive deposits  and iv offering competitively priced money market accounts and cds with maturities of up to five years 
the degree to which each segment of the strategy is achieved will affect profitability and exposure to interest rate risk 
the company continues to generate long term  fixed rate residential loans 
during the fiscal year ended june   fixed rate residential loan originations totaled million of which million was originated for sale into the secondary market  compared to million during the prior year 
at june   the fixed rate residential loan portfolio totaled million  with a weighted average maturity of months  compared to million with a weighted average maturity of months at june  the company originated million of which  was originated for sale into the secondary market in adjustable rate residential loans during the fiscal year ended june   compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
at june   fixed rate loans with remaining maturities in excess of years totaled million  or  of loans receivable  compared to million  or  of loans receivable  at june  the company originated million in fixed rate commercial and commercial real estate loans during the year ended june   compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the company also originated million in adjustable rate commercial and commercial real estate loans during the fiscal year ended june   compared to million during the prior year 
at june   adjustable rate home equity lines of credit had decreased to million  compared to million as of june  at june   the company s weighted average life of its investment portfolio was years  compared to years at june  at june   cds with original terms of two years or more totaled million  compared to million at june  interest rate sensitivity analysis the following table sets forth as of june  and  management s estimates of the projected changes in net portfolio value in the event of  and  instantaneous  permanent increases or decreases in market interest rates 
computations in the table below are based on prospective effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates and are based on an internally generated model using the actual maturity and repricing schedules for southern bank s loans and deposits  adjusted by management s assumptions for prepayment rates and deposit runoff 
further  the computations do not consider any reactions that the bank may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
these projected changes should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in any of the aforementioned interest rate changes 
management cannot accurately predict future interest rates or their effect on the company s npv and net interest income in the future 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv and net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  most of southern bank s loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the foregoing table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase
