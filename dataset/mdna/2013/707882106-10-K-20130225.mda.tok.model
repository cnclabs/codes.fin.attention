item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations key developments 
business strategy we intend to pursue the following business strategies continue to expand oil and ngl reserves and drilling inventory 
we anticipate spending up to approximately million for capital expenditures in we plan to allocate up to million  or approximately percent  to drilling and completion projects  primarily on our eagle ford shale acreage in gonzales and lavaca counties in south texas 
we plan to allocate up to million  or approximately eight percent  to leasehold projects to further expand our drilling inventory 
we anticipate allocating the remaining million  or approximately six percent  to pipeline  gathering  seismic and and facilities projects 
grow our cash flows and margins 
we expect our operating cash flows and margins will continue to grow on a pro forma basis taking into consideration recent asset sales as we increase our oil and ngl production through investment in higher rate of return development oil projects 
maintain our liquidity and financial position 
we expect to continue to use our operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  or the revolver  to fund our capital requirements in the revolver limits our leverage to times ebitdax as defined in the revolver through december   times ebitdax through june  and times ebitdax thereafter through its maturity in we have no material debt maturities until retain long term optionality of our core natural gas assets 
we maintain substantial natural gas properties  particularly in the haynesville shale and cotton valley sands in east texas  which are largely held by production 
at this time  we plan to retain these assets  which provide us with the option to increase development in these regions when natural gas prices improve 
pursue selective divestitures of non core assets to increase margins  operational focus and liquidity 
from time to time  we may dispose of certain non core assets and reinvest the proceeds into our oil and ngl focused projects 
manage risk exposure through an active hedging program 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging the commodity price risk for our expected production 
the level of our hedging activity and duration of the instruments employed depend upon our cash flows at risk  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
for  we have hedged approximately percent of our estimated crude oil production at average floor swap and ceiling prices of and per barrel 
in addition  we have hedged approximately percent of our estimated natural gas production at a weighted average floor swap price of per mmbtu and ceiling price of per mmbtu 
contracts transportation we have entered into contracts that provide firm transportation capacity rights for specified volumes per day on various pipeline systems for terms ranging from one to years 
the contracts require us to pay transportation demand charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity we use 
we may sell excess capacity to third parties at our discretion 
marketing we generally sell our crude oil  ngl and natural gas products using short term floating price physical and spot market contracts 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of our consolidated product revenues were attributable to four customers sunoco refining and marketing  inc  shell trading us company  gulfmark energy inc  and enterprise crude oil llc 
commodity derivative contracts we generally utilize collar  swap and swaption derivative contracts  among others  to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with anticipated sales of our future oil and gas production 
while the use of derivative instruments limits the risk of adverse price movements  such use may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the counterparty to a collar or swap contract is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor or swap price for such contract 
we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling or swap price for such contract 
neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price for such contract 
a swaption contract gives our counterparties the option to enter into a fixed price swap with us at a future date 
if the forward commodity price for the term of the swaption is higher than or equal to the swaption strike price on the exercise date  the counterparty will exercise its option to enter into a fixed price swap at the swaption strike price for the term of the swaption  at which point the contract functions as a fixed price swap 
if the forward commodity price for the term of the swaption is lower than the swaption strike price on the exercise date  the option expires and no fixed price swap is in effect 
we determine the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments based on discounted cash flows derived from third party quoted forward prices for nymex henry hub gas and west texas intermediate crude oil closing prices as of the end of the reporting period 
the discounted cash flows utilize discount rates adjusted for the credit risk of our counterparties if the derivative is in an asset position and our own credit risk if the derivative is in a liability position 
competition the oil and natural gas industry is very competitive  and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that are large  well established and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may adversely affect our ability to compete or grow our business 
many such companies not only engage in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves  but also carry on refining operations  electricity generation and the marketing of refined products 
competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties 
we may incur higher costs or be unable to acquire and develop desirable properties at costs we consider reasonable because of this competition 
we compete with other oil and natural gas companies to secure drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for the drilling and completion of wells and in the recruiting and retaining of qualified personnel 
such equipment and labor may be in short supply from time to time 
shortages of equipment  labor or materials may result in increased costs or the inability to obtain such resources as needed 
we also compete with substantially larger oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas  and the oil and natural gas industry in general competes with other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
government regulation and environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities 
compliance with these laws and regulations increases our cost of doing business 
also  environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years and the imposition of more stringent requirements  including any significant limitation on hydraulic fracturing  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a summary of the significant environmental laws to which our business operations are subject 
cercla 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  is also known as the superfund law 
cercla and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on parties that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
such responsible parties may be subject to joint and several liability under cercla for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own or lease properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas for a number of years 
many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties  and any wastes that may have been released on them  may be subject to cercla  and we could potentially be required to investigate and remediate such properties  including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators  or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
rcra 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and comparable state statutes regulate the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and clean up of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
under the auspices of the united states environmental protection agency  or the epa  the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra 
while there is currently an exclusion from rcra for drilling fluids  produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration and production of oil or natural gas  it is possible that some of these wastes could be classified as hazardous waste in the future  and therefore be subject to rcra 
oil pollution act 
the oil pollution act of  or the opa  contains numerous restrictions relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states 
the term waters of the united states has been interpreted broadly to include inland water bodies  including wetlands and intermittent streams 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liability for all containment and clean up costs  and certain other damages arising from a spill 
clean water act 
the federal water pollution control act  or the clean water act  governs the discharge of certain pollutants into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters without a permit issued by the epa or the state is prohibited 
the clean water act also requires the preparation and implementation of spill prevention  control and countermeasure plans in connection with on site storage of significant quantities of oil 
notably  in pennsylvania  wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process can no longer be sent to publicly owned treatment works directly 
new wastewater discharges must be treated at a centralized waste treatment facility and comply with certain total dissolved solids standards prior to being discharged to publicly owned treatment works 
this restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste may result in increased costs 
the epa is currently developing analogous pretreatment standards on the federal level 
safe drinking water act 
the safe drinking water act  or the sdwa  and the underground injection control program promulgated under the sdwa  establish the requirements for salt water disposal well activities and prohibit the migration of fluid containing contaminants into underground sources of drinking water 
we engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with the wells in which we act as operator 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells  particularly in unconventional plays like the eagle ford shale  granite wash  haynesville shale and the marcellus shale formations 
the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act that was introduced in both the th and th congresses would subject hydraulic fracturing operations to federal regulation under the sdwa and require the disclosure of chemicals used by us and others in the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
sponsors of these bills have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
proposed legislation would require  among other things  the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings against producers and service providers 
in addition  these bills  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting of hydraulic fracturing operations at the federal level  which could lead to operational delays  increased operating and compliance costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult or commercially impracticable for us to perform hydraulic fracturing 
such costs and burdens could delay the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations  which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing 
additionally  the epa has commenced a comprehensive research study to investigate the potential adverse impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and ground water 
the epa released a progress report on its study on december  and expects to release a final draft for public comment and peer review in additionally  certain states in which we operate have adopted regulations requiring the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
for instance  mississippi  oklahoma  pennsylvania and texas have implemented chemical disclosure requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations 
we currently disclose all hydraulic fracturing additives we use on www 
fracfocus 
org  a website created by the ground water protection council and interstate oil and gas compact commission 
prohibitions and other regulatory limitations on hydraulic fracturing 
there have been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the state level to restrict oil and gas drilling operations in certain locations 
for example  pennsylvania has instituted a moratorium on leasing state forest land for gas drilling and municipalities in new york have banned or limited hydraulic fracturing within their borders 
additionally  the new york state department of environmental conservation  or nydec  has ceased issuing drilling permits for horizontal drilling under the general environmental impact statement  pending completion of the supplemental general environmental impact statement  or sgeis  that takes into account the impacts of high volume hydraulic fracturing 
however  the nydec has stated that it will consider individual  site specific environmental reviews for any entity that wishes to proceed with a permit application as long as that review is of similar scope and depth as the sgeis 
the most recent draft of the sgeis was released in september but final regulations have not yet been issued 
in addition to chemical disclosure rules  some states have implemented permitting  well construction or water withdrawal regulations that may increase the costs of hydraulic fracturing operations 
pennsylvania and west virginia have issued setback regulations for wells 
colorado recently enacted new setback restrictions as well as requirements to conduct sampling on water wells before and after drilling 
in addition  states such as texas and pennsylvania have water withdrawal restrictions allowing suspension of withdrawal rights in times of shortages while other states require reporting on the amount of water used and its source 
increased regulation of and attention given by environmental interest groups  as well as state and federal regulatory authorities  to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques 
additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas  including from the developing shale plays  or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 
these developments could also lead to litigation challenging proposed or operating wells 
the adoption of federal  state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing that are more stringent could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells  as well as increased compliance costs and time  which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we use hydraulic fracturing extensively and any increased federal  state  or local regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover 
clean air act 
our operations are subject to the clean air act  or the caa  and comparable state and local requirements 
in  the us congress adopted amendments to the caa containing provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations 
the epa and states have developed  and continue to develop  regulations to implement these requirements 
we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission related issues 
further  stricter requirements could negatively impact our production and operations 
for example  the texas commission on environmental quality and the railroad commission of texas have been evaluating possible additional regulation of air emissions in response to concerns about allegedly high concentrations of benzene in the air near drilling sites and natural gas processing facilities 
these initiatives could lead to more stringent air permitting  increased regulation and possible enforcement actions at the local  state and federal levels 
additionally  on april   the epa issued new rules subjecting all oil and gas operations production  processing  transmission  storage and distribution to regulation under the new source performance standards  or nsps  and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants  or neshaps  programs 
the new rules regulate emissions from several types of emission sources that have never before been subject to federal standards  and also include nsps standards for completion of hydraulically fractured gas wells 
the standards apply to newly drilled and fractured wells  as well as existing wells that are refractured 
the neshaps regulations apply to certain major sources of hazardous air pollutants not previously subject to maximum achievable control technology  or mact  standards 
these rules may require a number of modifications to our operations  including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our compressors at initial startup  or october   whichever is later 
compliance with such rules could result in significant costs  including increased capital expenditures and operating costs  and could adversely impact our business 
we are currently researching the effect these new rules will have on our business  but generally expect them to add to the cost and expense of our operations 
there have been recent claims asserted that individual wells and other facilities should be aggregated together and their collective emissions considered in determining whether major source permitting requirements apply under the caa 
if we were required to aggregate individual wells and other facilities  it could bring us within the ambit of the title v permitting program  and we could be considered a major source for mact applicability 
for example  though the sixth circuit recently vacated an epa determination to aggregate natural gas wells and a sweetening plant in summit petroleum corp 
v 
epa et al  the epa released a december  memorandum stating that although the epa will follow the court interpretation when considering aggregation in the sixth circuit  it will continue to follow its current practice of considering interrelatedness in other jurisdictions 
in addition  in citizens for pennsylvania future v 
ultra resources  inc  a case challenging a decision not to aggregate certain facilities in pennsylvania  the court allowed the case to move forward by denying defendant motion to dismiss  even though the plaintiff had not exhausted review procedures with the administrative agency 
greenhouse gas emissions 
both in the united states and worldwide  there is increasing attention being paid to the issue of climate change and the contributing effect of greenhouse gas  or ghg  emissions 
on june   the epa issued the final mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule  or the reporting rule  requiring all stationary sources that emit more than  tons of ghgs per year to collect and report to the epa data regarding such emissions 
the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme  which began in  requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent ghgs to inventory and report their ghg emissions occurring in the prior calendar year on a facility by facility basis 
on november   the epa issued final rules applying these regulations to the oil and gas source category  including oil and natural gas production  natural gas processing  transmission  distribution and storage facilities subpart w 
this action does not require control of ghgs 
however  the epa has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future ghg limits 
in addition  in  the epa issued a final rule known as the epa endangerment finding finding that current and projected concentrations of six key ghgs in the atmosphere threaten public health and the environment  as well as the welfare of current and future generations 
legal challenges to these findings have been asserted  and the us congress is considering legislation to delay or repeal the epa actions  but we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or these efforts 
the epa has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the caa 
these rules were subject to judicial challenge  but on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit rejected challenges to the tailoring rule and other epa rules relating to the regulation of ghgs under the caa 
starting july   the epa required facilities that must already obtain new source review permits for other pollutants to include ghgs in their permits for new construction projects that emit at least  tons per year of ghgs and existing facilities that increase their emissions by at least  tons per year 
on march   the epa issued its proposed nsps for carbon dioxide emissions standard from new and modified power plants and held public hearings on the rule in may and accepted written comments until june  the us congress has considered a number of legislative proposals to restrict ghg emissions 
also  many states and regions have adopted ghg initiatives and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of ghgs by certain facilities 
while it is not possible to predict how any regulations to restrict ghg emissions may come into force  these and other legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting ghg emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs or curtail oil and gas operations in certain areas and could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we sell 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our operations 
osha 
we are subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act  or osha  and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations  and the provision of such information to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
other osha standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations 
endangered species act 
the endangered species act and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species 
employees and labor relations we had a total of employees as of december  we consider our current employee relations to be favorable 
we and our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements

item a risk factors our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described below 
however  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we may currently deem immaterial  may become important factors that harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices are volatile  and a substantial or extended decline in prices would hurt our profitability and financial condition 
our revenues  operating results  cash flows  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and gas properties depend heavily on prevailing market prices for crude oil  ngls and natural gas 
historically  crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
even relatively modest drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results and impede our growth 
wide fluctuations in crude oil  ngls and natural gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market demand and other factors that are beyond our control  including domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil  ngls and natural gas  domestic and foreign consumer demand for oil and natural gas  political and economic conditions in oil or gas producing regions  overall domestic and foreign economic conditions  prices and availability of  and demand for  alternative fuels  the availability of gathering  processing and transportation facilities  weather conditions  and domestic and foreign governmental regulation 
many of our projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of crude oil  ngls and natural gas 
these price assumptions are used for planning purposes 
we expect our assumptions will change over time and that actual prices in the future will likely differ from our estimates 
any substantial or extended decline in the actual prices of crude oil  ngls or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations including reduced cash flows  borrowing capacity and possible asset impairment  the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce  the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties and our ability to fund our capital program 
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce  our reserves will decline  eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations 
we have historically succeeded in substantially replacing reserves primarily through exploration and development and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions 
we have conducted such activities on our existing oil and gas properties as well as on newly acquired properties 
we may not be able to continue to replace reserves and production from such activities at acceptable costs 
currently depressed gas prices may further limit the types of reserves that can be developed economically 
lower prices also decrease our cash flows and may cause us to reduce capital expenditures 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
we may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flows from operations are reduced and external sources of capital are limited 
in addition  exploration and development activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes  the failure to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 
we are continually identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities 
however  competition for oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us 
in the event we are successful in completing an acquisition  we cannot ensure that such acquisition will consist of properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that such acquisition will be profitably integrated into our operations 
we may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures to find  acquire  develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
in  we anticipate making capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of up to approximately million 
if crude oil or ngl prices decrease  natural gas prices fail to recover or we encounter operating difficulties that result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected  we may have to reduce our capital expenditures unless we have borrowing capacity under the revolver 
future cash flows and the availability of financing will also be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells and prices of crude oil  ngls and natural gas 
if our revenues were to decrease due to lower crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices  decreased production or other reasons  and if we could not obtain capital through the revolver  or otherwise on acceptable terms  our ability to execute our development plans  replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and our ability to service our indebtedness depends on certain financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of debt outstanding and would have been able to incur an additional million net of million of letters of credit under the revolver 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
subject to certain conditions  our existing debt instruments do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness 
any increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation we will have additional cash requirements in order to support the payment of interest on our outstanding indebtedness  increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  and depending on the levels of our outstanding debt  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes may be limited 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial condition and operating performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and to certain financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be forced  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  or reduce or delay planned operating expenditures 
such measures might not be successful and might not enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 
the borrowing base under the revolver may be reduced in the future if commodity prices decline 
the borrowing base under the revolver is million as of december  our borrowing base is re determined twice a year and is scheduled to be redetermined during april if crude oil  ngl or natural gas prices decline  the borrowing base under the revolver may be reduced 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain funding under the revolver 
if funding is not available when or in the amounts needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  it might adversely affect our development plan as currently anticipated and our ability to make new acquisitions  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  financial condition and results of operations 
the revolver and our other debt instruments have restrictive covenants that could limit our financial flexibility 
the revolver and the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
our ability to borrow under the revolver is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants  including leverage and interest coverage ratios 
the revolver includes other restrictions that  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  engage in mergers  consolidations and liquidations  make asset dispositions  restricted payments and investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and amend  modify or prepay certain indebtedness 
the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events  as well as other limitations  including limitations on the declaration and payment of dividends or other restricted payments  limitations on incurring additional indebtedness or issuing preferred stock  limitations on the creation or existence of certain liens  limitations on incurring restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments  limitations on transactions with affiliates  and limitations on the sale of assets 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debts 
we do not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reserves will be found 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations  equipment failures or accidents  costs  shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs  crews  equipment and materials  shortages in experienced labor  failure to or delays in securing necessary regulatory approvals and permits  including delays due to potential hydraulic fracturing regulations  fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  and adverse weather conditions 
the prevailing prices of crude oil  ngls and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
the availability of drilling rigs and equipment can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand  an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region 
the wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
in addition  limitations on the use of hydraulic fracturing could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and produce oil and natural gas from new wells  which would reduce our rate of return on these wells and our cash flows 
drilling activities can result in dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling costs 
our future drilling activities may not be successful  nor can we be sure that our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular area will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  we may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify 
although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations  we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from all of them 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers  and nonpayment or nonperformance by these parties would reduce our cash flows 
we are subject to risk from loss resulting from our customers nonperformance or nonpayment 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues 
in  percent of our total consolidated product revenues resulted from four of our customers 
any nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers would reduce our cash flows 
we participate in oil and gas leases with third parties and these third parties may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects 
we frequently own less than of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations  and other parties own the remaining portion of the working interest 
financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling  equipping  completing and operating wells is shared by more than one party 
we could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners  such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of the other working interest owners 
in addition  the possibility of an economic downturn and the volatility in commodity prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners  particularly those that are smaller and less established than we  are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations 
some of our project partners have experienced liquidity and cash flow problems 
these problems may lead our partners to attempt to delay the pace of drilling or project development in order to preserve cash 
a partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs 
in some cases  a partner may declare bankruptcy 
in the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs  we would likely have to pay those costs  and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business involves many operating risks  including hydraulic fracturing  that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate 
our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the exploitation  development and exploration for and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas  including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing 
these operating risks include fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering and casing collapses  formations with abnormal pressures  pipeline ruptures or spills  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  migration of fracturing fluids into surrounding groundwater  spills or releases of fracturing fluids including from trucks sometimes used to deliver these materials  spills or releases of brine or other produced water that may go off site  subsurface conditions that prevent us from i stimulating the planned number of stages  ii accessing the entirety of the wellbore with our tools during completion or iii removing all fracturing materials from the wellbore to allow production to begin  environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could result in substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damages  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations 
in addition  under certain circumstances  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own  lease or operate 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities  which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses 
if we experience any of these problems with well stimulation and completion activities  such as hydraulic fracturing  our ability to explore for and produce oil or natural gas may be adversely affected 
we could incur substantial losses or otherwise fail to realize reserves in particular formations as a result of the need to shut down  abandon and relocate drilling operations  the need to sample  test and monitor drinking water in particular areas and to provide filtration or other drinking water supplies to users of water supplies that may have been impacted or threatened by potential contamination from fracturing fluids  the need to modify drill sites to ensure there are no spills or releases off site and to investigate and or remediate any spills or releases that might have occurred  or suspension of our operations 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance at a level that balances the cost of insurance with our assessment of the risk and our ability to achieve a reasonable rate of return on our investments 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities or that we can purchase insurance against all possible losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant event  not fully insured or indemnified against  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on gathering  processing and transportation facilities owned by others 
we deliver substantially all of our oil and natural gas production through pipelines that we do not own 
the marketability of our production depends upon the availability  proximity and capacity of these pipelines  as well as gathering systems and processing facilities 
the unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
federal  state and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather  process and market our oil and natural gas 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are not precise 
this annual report on form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
these estimates are dependent on many variables and  therefore  changes often occur as these variables evolve and commodity prices fluctuate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
actual future production  crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed by us 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately percent of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped 
estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves is based on volumetric calculations and adjacent reserve performance data 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
production revenues from proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized until some time in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  these estimated costs may not be accurate  development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not occur as estimated 
moreover  the reserve estimation standards provide that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
these standards may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program 
moreover  we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not develop those reserves within the required five year time frame or cannot demonstrate that we could do so 
we removed approximately mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves in as a result of the five year limitation 
you should not assume that the present value of estimated future net cash flows standardized measure referred to herein is the current fair value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual current and future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
as a result  net present value estimates using actual prices and costs may be significantly less than the sec estimate that is provided herein 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for us 
we may record impairment losses on our oil and gas properties 
quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence in the period of assessment 
lower crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives on certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields  thus reducing proved property reserve estimates 
if such revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves occur  it will have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  on the affected properties  which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher dd a expense 
the revisions may also be sufficient enough to cause impairment losses on certain properties that would result in a further non cash charge to reported earnings 
gaap requires that the carrying value of oil and gas properties be reviewed on a periodic basis for possible impairment 
an impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value of oil and gas properties is greater than the undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to the property 
in addition to revisions to reserves and the impact of lower commodity prices  impairments may occur due to increases in estimated operating and development costs and other factors 
during the past several years  we have been required to impair certain of our oil and gas properties and related assets 
if crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices decline or we drill uneconomic wells  it is reasonably possible that we will have to record a significant impairment in the future 
while an impairment charge reflects our ability to recover the carrying value of our investments  it does not impact our cash flows from operating activities 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
in  other companies operated approximately percent of our net production 
our success in properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs 
our property acquisitions carry significant risks 
acquisition of oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production 
competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense 
in the event we do complete an acquisition  its success will depend on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the purchase price  future crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices  the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves  future operating and capital costs  results of future exploration  exploitation and development activities on the acquired properties and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves  actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
a customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems 
additionally  significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 
to the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties  our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited 
integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks 
these risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees 
any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short term or long term effects on our operating results  and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including complex environmental laws 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or a failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection and taxation 
our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water 
in the event of environmental violations  we may be charged with remedial costs and land owners may file claims for alternative water supplies  property damage or bodily injury 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may  in some circumstances  result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault 
in addition  pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
these liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
the practice of hydraulic fracturing has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into prospective rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production 
we use this completion technique on all of our wells 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing 
the epa also announced that one of its enforcement initiatives for to is to focus on environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector 
in addition  some states and local governments have enacted legislation or adopted regulations  and the us congress and other states are considering enacting legislation or adopting regulations  that could impose more stringent permitting  disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations 
individually or collectively  such new legislation or regulation could result in increased compliance and operating costs  delays or additional operating restrictions 
if the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited  prohibited or subjected to further regulation  these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the sale of our crude oil  ngls and natural gas  we periodically enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of two years or less 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil  ngl and natural gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil  ngl or natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements 
in trying to maintain an appropriate balance  we may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how crude oil  ngl or natural gas prices fluctuate in the future 
in addition  derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts crude oil  ngl or natural gas prices 
in addition  derivative instruments involve basis risk 
basis risk in a derivative contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
for example  a nymex index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production 
the enactment of derivatives legislation and regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
on july   new comprehensive financial reform legislation  known as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the act  was enacted that establishes federal oversight regulation of over the counter derivatives market and entities  such as us  that participate in that market 
the act requires the commodities futures trading commission  or cftc  the sec and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation 
in its rulemaking under the act  the cftc has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents 
certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits 
the position limits rule was vacated by the united states district court for the district of columbia in september  although the cftc has stated that it will appeal the district court decision 
the cftc also has finalized other regulations  including critical rulemakings on the definition of swap  security based swap  swap dealer and major swap participant 
the act and cftc rules also will require us in connection with certain derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements 
in addition  new regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements  although these regulations are not finalized and their application to us is uncertain at this time 
other regulations also remain to be finalized  and the cftc recently has delayed the compliance dates for various regulations already finalized 
as a result  it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the act and cftc rules on us or the timing of such effects 
the act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties 
the act and associated regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the act and associated regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
finally  the act was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the act is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations 
our ability to utilize us net operating loss 
or nol  carryforwards to reduce future taxable income is subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
the utilization of such carryforwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain ownership changes  including the purchase or sale of our stock by shareholders and our offering of stock during any three year period resulting in an aggregate change of more than in our beneficial ownership 
in the event of an ownership change  section of the code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that can be offset by these carryforwards 
as of december   we do not believe that an ownership change has occurred  however  to the extent an ownership change has occurred or were to occur in the future  it is possible that the limitations imposed on our ability to use pre ownership change losses could cause a significant net increase in our us federal income tax liability and could cause us federal income taxes to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect 
certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation 
president obama budget proposal for fiscal year recommended the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  the elimination of the deduction for united states production activities for oil and gas production  and an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and  if enacted  how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  and any such change could have a material adverse effect on us 
item b unresolved staff comments we have received no written sec staff comments regarding our periodic or current reports under the exchange act that were issued days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year and remain unresolved 
item properties the following map shows the general locations of our oil and gas production investments as of december  
pvakmapjpg 
facilities our headquarters and corporate office is located in radnor  pennsylvania and our primary operations are conducted from our office in houston  texas 
we also have district operations facilities at various locations in texas  oklahoma and mississippi 
all of our office facilities are leased with the exception of our district operations facilities in scottsville  texas 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs 
title to oil and gas properties prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and gas assets  we review title opinions on all material leases 
however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we make only a cursory review of title to farmout acreage and when we acquire undeveloped oil and gas leases 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations  a thorough title examination is conducted 
to the extent the title examination reflects defects  we cure such title defects 
if we are unable to cure any title defect of a nature such that it would not be prudent to commence drilling operations on a property  we could suffer a loss of our investment in the property 
our oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens for debt obligations  current taxes and other burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or materially affect the value of such properties 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our properties and the associated oil and natural gas in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industries 
preparation of reserves estimates our policies and practices regarding the recording of reserves are structured to objectively and accurately estimate our oil and gas reserve quantities and present values in compliance with the sec s regulations and gaap 
our manager of engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimate by our independent third party engineers  wright company  inc our manager of engineering has over years of industry experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserve information  holds a bs degree in petroleum engineering from texas a m university and is licensed by the state of texas as a professional engineer 
our internal controls over reserve estimates include reconciliation and review controls  including an independent internal review of assumptions used in the estimation 
the technical person primarily responsible for review of our reserve estimates at wright company  inc meets the requirements regarding qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
wright company  inc is an independent firm of petroleum engineers  geologists  geophysicists and petro physicists  they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control
