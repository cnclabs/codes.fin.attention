item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview business we are an independent investment management firm that provides a broad range of investment solutions through separately managed accounts  mutual funds and collective investment trust funds 
founded in  we offer equity and fixed income portfolios as well as a range of blended asset portfolios  such as life cycle portfolios  that use a mix of stocks and bonds 
we serve a diversified client base of high net worth individuals and institutions  including k plans  pension plans  taft hartley plans  and endowments and foundations 
our operations are based principally in the united states  with our headquarters located in fairport  new york 
our products we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and mutual funds and collective investment trusts including those offered by the manning napier fund  inc  or the fund  and exeter trust company 

table of contents our separate accounts are primarily distributed through our direct channel  where our representatives form relationships with high net worth individuals  middle market institutions or large institutions that are working with a consultant 
to a lesser extent  we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties  either through our intermediary channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients  or through our platform sub advisory channel  where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms 
our separate account products are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high net worth and middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries 
in contrast  larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios 
our mutual funds and collective investment trusts are primarily distributed through financial intermediaries  including brokers  financial advisors  retirement plan advisors and platform relationships 
we also obtain a portion of our mutual fund and collective investment trust distribution through our direct sales representatives  in particular within the defined contribution and institutional marketplace 
our mutual fund and collective investment trust products are an important driver of our blended asset class portfolios  in particular with k plan sponsors  advisors and recordkeepers that select our funds as default options for participants 
in addition  financial intermediaries  mutual fund advisory programs and retail platforms are a driver of equity strategies within our mutual fund offerings

the direct channel contributed of the total gross client inflows for our separate account business for the year ended december  and represented of our total separate account aum as of december  we anticipate the direct channel to continue to be the largest driver of new separate account business going forward  given the channel s high net worth and middle market institutional client type focus

as of december   equity and blended asset portfolios represented and of total direct channel separate account aum  while our fixed income portfolios were 
we expect our focus on individuals and middle market institutions to continue to drive interest in our blended asset class portfolios  where we provide a comprehensive portfolio of stocks and bonds managed to a client s specific investment objectives 
however  relationships with larger institutions have resulted in strong growth in equity portfolios as a percentage of total aum  which will likely continue given the breadth of our offerings  including domestic  international and global equity portfolios 
to a lesser extent  we also obtain separate account business from third parties  including financial advisors or unaffiliated registered investment advisor programs or platforms 
during  of the total gross client inflows for separate accounts came from financial advisor representatives intermediary channel  and an additional came from unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms platform sub advisor channel 
the intermediary and platform sub advisor channels represented of our total separate account aum as of december  new separate account business through the intermediary channel flowed into both our blended asset and equity portfolios  driven by advisors needs to identify either a one stop solution blended asset portfolio or to fill a mandate within a multi strategy portfolio

as of 
table of contents december   of our separate account aum derived from financial advisors was allocated to blended asset portfolios  with allocated to equity and allocated to fixed income 
we expect that equity and fixed income portfolios may see additional interest from financial advisors over time as more and more advisors structure a multi strategy portfolio 
in contrast  gross client inflows through the platform sub advisor channel are primarily directed to our equity strategies  where we are filling a specific mandate within the investment program or platform product 
during  of our separate account gross client inflows from the platform sub advisory channel were into equity portfolios  and we expect this will continue going forward 
as of december   equity portfolios represented of total platform sub advisory channel separate account aum 
our annualized separate account retention rate across all channels was approximately during the calendar year  representing the strong relationship focus that is inherent in our direct sales model  which is the primary driver of our separate account business 
for the year ended december   market appreciation for our separate account aum was  including in our blended assets and in equity portfolios

for the year ended december   market appreciation for our mutual funds and collective investment trust aum was  including in our blended assets and in equity portfolios 
mutual fund and collective investment trust business is driven by financial intermediaries and to a lesser extent  our direct sales representatives 
intermediary distribution of our mutual fund and collective investment trust vehicles is achieved via financial advisors  brokers  retirement plan advisors and approval of our funds within mutual fund platforms 
through our intermediary channel  we are increasingly focused on our blended asset life cycle fund vehicles given our emphasis on advisors that work with retirement plans 
we anticipate greater use of our blended asset portfolios by advisors seeking a multi asset class solution for their retail clients 
in addition  our allocation to equity portfolios within the intermediary channel may also increase due to interest from national brokerage firm representatives who wish to use our mutual funds as a sleeve within a larger portfolio 
through our platform sub advisor channel  we have relationships with consultants and advisors at platforms 
we derive equity portfolio assets in this channel through the selection of our funds within advisory programs where our mutual funds are used within a multi strategy portfolio  or through placement on platforms approved lists of funds 
to facilitate our relationships with intermediaries  we currently have more than dealer relationships 
the continued increase in financial intermediaries offering our mutual funds and collective investment trusts to clients will afford us the opportunity for continued growth across distribution channels 
these relationships are an important component in expanding our retail business as well as our k life cycle and institutional business 
our direct sales representatives distribute our equity portfolios  in particular our non us portfolios  to large institutional clients for which we have direct relationships with the client and often  the client s consultant 
through the direct channel  we also form relationships with middle market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our life cycle mutual funds and collective investment trusts as default options on their investment menu 
we expect this channel to be focused on distributing blended asset and equity portfolio funds  particularly as the breadth of our mutual fund and collective investment trust offerings expands 
results of operations below is a discussion of our combined consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and 
table of contents key components of results of operations overview 
changes to our operating results over time are largely driven by net new client asset flows and changes to the market value of our aum 
an important factor influencing inflows and outflows of our aum is the investment performance of our various investment approaches 
our variety of stock selection strategies  absolute pricing discipline and active asset allocation management approach generally results in specific absolute and relative return characteristics in different market environments 
for example  during a fundamental driven bull market when prices are rising alongside improving fundamentals  we are likely to experience positive absolute returns and competitive relative returns 
however  in a more momentum driven bull market  when prices become disconnected from underlying fundamentals  we are likely to experience positive absolute returns but lagging relative returns 
similarly  during a valuation driven bear market  when markets experience a period of price correction following a momentum driven bull market  we are likely to experience negative absolute returns but strong relative returns 
however  in a momentum driven bear market  which is typically characterized by broad price declines in a highly correlated market  we are likely to experience negative absolute returns and lagging relative returns 
essentially  our approach is likely to do well when markets are driven by fundamentals  but lag when markets are driven primarily by momentum 
other components of our operating results include asset based fee rates and changes in those rates  the composition of our aum among various portfolios  vehicles and client types  and the rate of increase in our variable and fixed costs  which is affected by the rate of revenue increases  compensation and year to year changes in incentive bonuses  changes to base compensation  vendor related costs and investment spending on new products  consultative staffing and proprietary and third party technology development

our revenues primarily consist of investment management fees earned from managing our clients aum 
we earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients aum either as of a specified date or on a daily basis 
our investment management fees fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products  which are affected by the composition of our aum among various portfolios and investment vehicles 
we currently do not have revenues from performance fee based products

operating expenses 
our largest operating expenses are employee compensation and sub transfer agent shareholder service fees  discussed further below  with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our aum and revenues 
we review our operating expenses in relation to the investment market environment and changes in our revenues 
however  we are generally willing to make expenditures as necessary even in the face of declining rates of growth in revenues in order to support our investment products  our client service levels  strategic initiatives and our long term value 
compensation and related costs 
employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense  including employee salaries and benefits  incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals and reorganization related share based compensation 
these costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount  mix of existing job descriptions  competitive factors  the addition of new skill sets and or changes in our stock price reflected in share based compensation 

table of contents sub transfer agent shareholder service fees 
sub transfer agent shareholder service fees represent amounts paid to various platforms that distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trust products 
these expenses increase as the aum in our mutual fund and collective investment trust products increase 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include costs for custodial services  asset based distribution fees including b distribution and servicing fees and fund fee waiver and or expense reimbursement  professional fees  including accounting and legal fees  occupancy and facility costs  as well as other costs related to travel and entertainment expenses  insurance  market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day to day operations of our business 
non operating income loss 
non operating income loss includes interest expense  interest and dividend income  and gains losses related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as trading 
prior to being publicly traded  we had a mandatory redemption obligation upon the death of william manning to pay his estate his pro rata share of net revenue for the four quarters immediately preceding his death 
our liability related to this mandatory redemption obligation was calculated each fiscal quarter  and the change in the liability was reflected as non cash interest expense 
upon the consummation of the initial public offering  such mandatory redemption obligation terminated and we no longer reflect non cash interest expense or the liability related to such agreement 
provision for income taxes 
the company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either an s corporation  a limited liability company llc  or a c corporation 
as such  the entities functioning as s corporations or llc s are not liable for or able to benefit from us federal or most state and local income taxes on their earnings  as such earnings losses will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity s shareholders or unit holders 
the entities functioning as c corporations are liable for or able to benefit from us federal or state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses  respectively 
noncontrolling interests 
manning napier  inc holds approximately economic interest in manning napier group  but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of manning napier group 
as a result  the company consolidates the financial results of manning napier group and records a noncontrolling interest in our combined consolidated financial statements 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the combined consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings or loss attributable to the economic interest in manning napier group held by the noncontrolling members 
critical accounting policies and estimates the combined consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and related rules and regulations of the sec 
the preparation of combined consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates or assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions and may have a material effect on the combined consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition 
our management has identified the following significant accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management s judgment and estimates revenue recognition  equity based compensation  income tax provision  and payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to the notes to our combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are based on fees charged to manage customers portfolios 
investment management fees are generally computed as a percentage of aum and recognized as earned 
fees for providing investment advisory services are computed and billed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable investment management agreements 
for our separately managed accounts  clients either pay investment management fees in advance  typically for a semi annual or quarterly period  or in arrears  typically for a monthly or quarterly period 
when investment management fees are paid in advance  we defer the revenue and recognize it over the applicable period 
when investment management fees are paid in 
table of contents arrears  we estimate revenues based on aum market values as of the most recent month end date  and adjust to actual when billed 
revenue is also earned for providing custodial services  sub advisor services to mutual funds and collective investment trusts and other services 
for mutual funds and collective investment trust vehicles  our fees are calculated and earned daily based on aum 
because the majority of our revenues are earned based on aum that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue  we have presented our aum using the gaap framework for measuring fair value 
that framework provides a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs based on company assumptions level 
a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument s fair value measurement 
the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows level includes observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
level includes inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
level includes one or more significant unobservable inputs 
the table below summarizes the approximate amount of aum for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on level  level and level level level level total in millions december  aum december  aum as substantially all our aum is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs  we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our aum  as discussed under the heading item a 
risk factors and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all other revenue earned by us is recognized on a gaap accounting basis as earned per the terms of the specific contract 
equity based compensation the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award for the portion of the shares that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
income tax provision management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance that might be required against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which were primarily attributable to an increase in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of manning napier group s election under section of the internal revenue code 
in the event that sufficient taxable income of the same character does not result in future years  among other things  a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required 
because the determination of our annual income tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates  it is likely that the actual results will vary from those recorded in our financial statements 
hence  we recognize additions to and reductions in income tax expense during a reporting period that pertains to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and our actual tax returns and tax audits are completed 
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized 
payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement as a result of the company s purchase of class a units of manning napier group from m n group holdings and manning napier group s election under section of the internal revenue code  the company expects to benefit from 
table of contents depreciation and amortization deductions from an increase in tax basis of tangible and intangible assets of manning napier group 
those deductions allocated to the company will be taken into account in reporting the company s taxable income 
upon consummation of the initial public offering during the period ended december   the company entered into a tax receivable agreement tra with m n group holdings  mncc and the other holders of class a units of manning napier group  under which we are required to pay to the holders of such class a units of the applicable cash savings  if any  in us federal  state  local and foreign income tax that we actually realize  or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances as a result of any step up in tax basis in manning napier group s assets resulting from i the company s purchase of such class a units from m n group holdings with a portion of the net proceeds of the initial public offering  ii the company s purchases or exchanges of such class a units from m n group holdings and mncc  respectively  for cash or shares of our class a common stock and iii payments under the tax receivable agreement  including any tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of such agreement 
as of december   the company recorded a liability of million  representing the payments due to the selling unitholders 
the amount and timing of any payments vary based on a number of factors  including no material change in the relevant tax law  the company continues to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits  and assuming no additional uncertain tax positions that are subject to the tax receivable agreement  depending upon the outcome of these factors  we may be obligated to make substantial payments pursuant to the tra 
the actual payment amounts may differ from these estimated amounts  as the liability will reflect changes in prevailing tax rates as well as the actual benefit it realized on the tax return 
within the next month period  the company expects to pay approximately million of the total amount 
the basis for determining the current portion of the payments under the tra is the expected amount of payments to be made within the next months 
the long term portion of the payments is the remainder 
to determine the current amount of the payments due  the company estimated the amount of taxable income that manning napier generated during and the estimated amount of the specified tra deductions for the respective period 
this was used as a basis for determining the amount of tax deduction that generates a tra obligation which was used to calculate the estimated payments due under the tra that the company expects to pay in the next months 
these calculations are performed in accordance with the terms of the tra 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this standard eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to this standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
the adoption of these amendments on january  did not have a material impact on our combined consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in may  fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments in this update change the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the adoption of these amendments on january  did not have a material impact on our combined consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to the role of our operating company as an investment adviser for the mutual funds and separate accounts it manages 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with these funds and accounts 
under these agreements  the investment management fees we receive are based on the value of our aum and our fee rates 
accordingly  our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our aum 
table of contents decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenues to decline further 
the value of our aum was billion as of december  assuming a increase or decrease in the value of our aum and the change being proportionally distributed over all our products  the value would increase or decrease by approximately billion  which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately million at our current weighted average fee rate of we have not adopted a corporate level risk management policy regarding client assets  nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level the market risks that would affect the value of our overall aum and related revenues 
some of these risks eg  sector risks and currency risks are inherent in certain strategies  and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to these risks 
we also are subject to market risk from a decline in the prices of investment securities that we own 
these securities consist primarily of equity securities  fixed income securities  and investment in mutual funds  including the fund for which mna provides advisory services 
the value of these investment securities was million as of december  of which million is classified as trading  and million is classified as available for sale 
management regularly monitors the value of these investments  however  given their nature and relative size  we have not adopted a specific risk management policy to manage the associated market risk 
assuming a increase or decrease in the values of these investment securities  the fair value would increase or decrease by million 
due to the nature of our business  we believe that we do not face any material risk from inflation 
exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the accounts that we advise  or sub advise  hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
movements in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the underlying foreign currency affect the values of assets held in accounts we manage  thereby affecting the amount of revenues we earn 
the value of the assets we manage was billion as of december  as of december   approximately of our aum across our investment strategies was invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent our aum are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  the value of those aum would decrease  with an increase in the value of the us dollar  or increase  with a decrease in the value of the us dollar 
we monitor our exposure to exchange rate risk and make decisions on how to manage such risk accordingly  however  we have not adopted a corporate level risk management policy to manage exchange rate risk 
assuming that of our aum is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangements  a increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our aum by billion  which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately million at our current weighted average fee rate of 
interest rate risk we typically invest our excess cash balances in money market mutual funds that invest primarily in us treasury or agency backed money market instruments 
these funds attempt to maintain a stable net asset value but interest rate changes may affect the fair value of such investments and  if significant  could result in a loss of investment principal 
interest rate changes affect the income we earn from our excess cash balances
