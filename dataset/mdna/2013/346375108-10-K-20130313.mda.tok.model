item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions as described under the note regarding forward looking statements that appears earlier in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  sell and support precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe card products and solutions 
semiconductor manufacturers use our wafer probe cards to perform wafer sort and test on the semiconductor die  or chips  on the whole semiconductor wafer  which is prior to singulation of the wafer into individual separate chips 
we work closely with our customers on product design  as each wafer probe card is a custom product that is specific to the chip and wafer designs of the customer 
during wafer sort and test  a wafer probe card is mounted in a prober and connected to a semiconductor tester 
the wafer probe card is used as an interface to connect electrically with and test individual chips on a wafer 
our products can be used to test a broad range of semiconductor chips  including dram  flash  soc  and in line parametric testing 
during fiscal  we saw revenues increase million from million in to million in revenue growth was driven by soc and flash product markets which were up million and million  respectively  when compared with soc product revenue increase was driven by million higher sales added in the fourth quarter from our acquisition of microprobe 
flash sales growth was driven by increased market share in the nand flash market 
dram revenue was down million versus as the second half of saw significantly weaker personal computer demand and a less favorable dram device pricing environment 
during fiscal  we continued the activities initiated in to restructure our operations to simplify our overall structure and better align our operations with the current business environment  streamline our manufacturing structure and reduce both manufacturing cost and cycle times 
as part of this simplification  we reduced our workforce by employees  or  during fiscal  without giving effect to the microprobe acquisition 
we incurred net losses of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net loss also decreased year over year due to the reduction in operating expenses driven by both our restructuring actions and our continued focus on cost reduction efforts 
the net loss for fiscal includes microprobe operating activity from the acquisition date to fiscal year end of million in revenue and million of net loss  which includes million of intangible amortization and other expenses 
in addition  the net loss includes restructuring charges of million  impairment charges of million  and million in acquisition and integration costs  offset by a benefit of million from the release of the u 
s jurisdiction deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting from the deferred tax liability recorded for the million of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of microprobe and a benefit from our patent settlement 
the net loss for fiscal was primarily due to lower gross margins on products sold  million of restructuring charges  and the impairment of certain long lived assets of million  offset by a benefit of million from the release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for a non us jurisdiction 
recent acquisition on october   pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization the acquisition agreement  dated as of august   as amended  a wholly owned subsidiary of formfactor merged with and into astria semiconductor holding  inc  including its subsidiary microprobe  inc together microprobe  with astria continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of formfactor the microprobe acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under which assets and liabilities of microprobe were recorded at their respective fair values including an amount for goodwill representing the difference between the acquisition consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets 
the total acquisition consideration of million was determined based on the terms of the acquisition agreement which consisted of a million in cash  subject to a million decrease based on microprobe working capital as of the consummation of the acquisition relative to an agreed upon target  b  shares of formfactor common stock valued at the closing market price of on october   and c a settlement of million related to patent litigation between the two parties 
microprobe is a semiconductor equipment company that designs  develops  manufactures  sells and services high performance  custom designed advanced soc wafer probe cards and analytical test equipment used in the semiconductor 
table of contents industry 
microprobe is a global company with operations in the us and asia  including china  south korea  singapore and taiwan 
the acquisition of microprobe enables us to leverage the combination of two advanced wafer probe card manufacturers and expand our soc product portfolio to meaningfully diversify our business 
our preliminary allocation of the acquisition price at fair value includes intangible assets of million and goodwill of million 
we incurred million of acquisition and integration costs which were reported as selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal see note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following information is important to understanding our business  our financial statements and the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations fiscal year 
fiscal years ended december  and december  had weeks each and fiscal year ended december  had weeks 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from product sales of wafer probe cards 
revenues from our customers are subject to fluctuations due to factors including  but not limited to  design cycles  technology adoption rates  competitive pressure to reduce prices  cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold and market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
historically  increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products  the introduction of new  more complex products and the penetration of new markets 
we expect that revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials  payroll  shipping and handling costs  manufacturing related overhead and amortization of certain intangible assets 
our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products  some of which are a sole source 
we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders 
tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues 
we expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions as cost of revenues 
we design  manufacture and sell custom advanced wafer probe cards into the semiconductor test market  which is subject to significant variability and demand fluctuations 
our wafer probe cards are complex products that are custom to a specific chip design of a customer and must be delivered on relatively short lead times as compared to our overall manufacturing process 
as our advanced wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
we record an adjustment to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolete and non sellable inventories based on assumptions about future demand  past usage  changes to manufacturing processes and overall market conditions 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering and material costs 
almost all research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and capitalization of such costs have been immaterial in all periods to date 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities to improve and enhance existing product technologies and to develop new technologies for current and new products and for new applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  provision for doubtful accounts  internal and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other sales  marketing  administrative activities  and amortization of certain intangible assets 
these expenses also include costs for protecting and enforcing our patent rights and regulatory compliance costs 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges include costs related to employee termination benefits  cost of long lived assets abandoned or impaired  as well as contract termination costs 
impairment of long lived assets 
asset impairment charges include charges associated with the write down of assets that have no future expected benefit or assets for which circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  as well as adjustments to the carrying amount of our assets held for sale 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
table of contents statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates may change as new information is obtained 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition  fair value of marketable securities  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for product warranty  valuation of obsolete and slow moving inventory  business combinations  legal contingencies  realizability of goodwill  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  valuation and recognition of stock based compensation  provision for income taxes and related deferred tax assets  valuation and tax liabilities and accruals for other liabilities have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations reported in our financial statements and related disclosures 
we have identified the following accounting policies as being critical because they require our management to make particularly difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
our management has discussed the development  selection  application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the deliverable is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management best estimate of selling price besp for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe is unavailable 
we have adopted this guidance effective with the first quarter of fiscal and it has been applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after december  this guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
we do not have a significant number of product offerings with multiple elements 
our multiple element arrangements generally include probe cards and product maintenance and repair services 
we allocate revenue to the deliverables based upon their relative selling price 
revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services are rendered  the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
product maintenance and repair services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed  generally one year  and costs are recorded as incurred 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe  tpe or besp 
for the vast majority of our arrangements involving multiple deliverables  such as sales of products with services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative selling price  using vsoe 
for those deliverables for which we cannot establish vsoe  we have determined our best estimate of selling price  as the company has determined it is unable to establish tpe of selling price for the deliverables 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the deliverable were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a deliverable by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives and pricing practices 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows for fiscal and fiscal if the new accounting standards for revenue recognition had been applied in the same manner during fiscal  there would not have been a material impact on total net revenues 
revenues from the licensing of our design and manufacturing technology  which have not been material to date  are 
table of contents recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the design  development  manufacture  sale and support of precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards 
in september  the fasb amended its guidance to simplify testing goodwill for impairment  allowing an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if an entity determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the performance of the quantitative impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting unit using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value  we perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we performed our goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter 
no impairment charges associated with our goodwill and intangible assets were recorded during fiscal business acquisitions our consolidated financial statements include the operations of an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition 
we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting 
the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires  among other things  that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date  and that the fair value of acquired intangible assets including in process research and development  or ipr d  be recorded on the balance sheet 
also  transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits and financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of days or less at the time of acquisition 
marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than days when purchased 
we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholder equity  net of tax 
any unrealized losses which are considered to be other than temporary impairments are recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method and recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value 
all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other than temporary  or have other indicators of impairments 
if the fair value of an available for sale investment is less than its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where we intend to sell the instrument  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument 
if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the available for sale investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize an other than temporary impairment charge equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value 
restructuring charges restructuring charges include costs related to employee termination benefits  long lived assets impaired or abandoned  and contract termination costs 
the determination of when we accrue for employee termination benefits and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under a one time benefit arrangement or under an on going benefit arrangement 
for restructuring charges recorded as an on going benefit arrangement  a liability for post employment benefits is recorded when payment is probable  the amount is reasonably estimable  and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated 
for restructuring charges recorded as a one time benefit arrangement  we recognize a liability for employee termination benefits when a plan of termination  approved by management and establishing the terms of the benefit arrangement  has been communicated to employees 
the timing of the recognition of one time employee termination benefits is dependent upon the period of time the employees are required to render service after communication 
if employees are not required to render service in order to receive the termination benefits or if employees will not be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period  a liability for the termination benefits is recognized at the communication date 
in instances where employees will be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period  the liability for employee termination benefits is measured initially at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date and is recognized ratably over the future service period 
we 
table of contents continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
we record charges related to long lived assets to be abandoned when the assets cease to be used 
when we cease using a building or other asset with remaining non cancelable lease payments continuing beyond our use period  we record a liability for remaining payments under lease arrangements  as well as for contract termination costs  that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to us at the cease use date 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
warranty obligations we offer warranties on certain products and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims at the time revenue is recognized 
the warranty liability is based upon historical experience and our estimate of the level of future costs 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess inventory and product obsolescence based upon assumptions about forecasted future sales  past usage  and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under non cancelable purchase commitments in comparison to our past usage and estimated forecast of product demand for the next six months to determine what inventory quantities  if any  may not be sellable 
based on this analysis  we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
market conditions are subject to change  and demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand and this difference could have a material impact on our gross profit and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventories or a benefit from the sale of inventories previously written down 
allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world 
in order to monitor potential credit losses  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
we take into consideration any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer inability to meet its financial obligations and our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amounts of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in an orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 

table of contents income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
we estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to determine whether there is a need for a valuation allowance with respect to such deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider available positive and negative evidence giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carryback losses against prior taxable income and  commensurate with objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 
stock based compensation under provisions of accounting standards  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time 
a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock option awards while the fair value for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing market price of our common stock on the dated of grant 
the most significant assumptions impacted by management judgment are the expected volatility and the expected life of the options 
the expected dividend yield and expected risk free interest rate are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
in addition  adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based payment awards that we expect to vest did have a significant impact on the recorded share based compensation expense 
expected volatility the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of traded options to purchase shares of our common stock 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock alone 
expected life and forfeiture rate the expected life also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  longer option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  employees are not required to wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  we are required to estimate the expected term of the option 
we determine the expected life by considering several factors  including historical option exercise behavior  post vesting turnover rates  contractual terms and vesting periods of the options granted 
similarly  we base our estimate of forfeiture on historical option cancellation behavior including pre vesting turnover rates 

table of contents out of period adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million adjustment to cost of revenues net of million income tax benefit  which resulted from an error in the calculation of capitalized manufacturing variances starting in the first quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal the error caused the understatement of cost of revenues and the overstatement of the overhead capitalized in inventory for most quarters 
the income tax benefit resulted from a higher net loss in due to higher costs of revenue

table of contents fiscal years ended december  and december  revenues fiscal of fiscal of change revenues revenues in thousands revenues by market dram soc flash total revenues for the global semiconductor market  overall device shipments were down in compared to revenues in the memory markets saw the largest reduction compared to the soc market 
the dram market weakened  particularly in the second half of the year  as forecasted consumer demand for personal computers  or pc  did not materialize and device pricing fell to levels resulting in unprofitable business for most suppliers 
the nor and nand flash markets also declined  driven by slow growth in bit shipments leading to an inventory oversupply and reduced production capacity by leading producers 
soc revenue reductions were not as severe as those for memory markets  with pc demand related reductions somewhat offset by growth in mobile processor demand 
overall  our revenues increased by  or million  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  of which million was due to the microprobe acquisition 
our revenues increased year over year in the soc market and in flash  but were down in dram 
the change in flash and dram revenues was primarily driven by unit volume  while the increase in the soc revenues was attributed to our acquisition of microprobe 
our revenues for fiscal were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
the year on year reduction in our revenue from sales to dram device manufacturers in fiscal aligned closely with the overall weakening of the dram semiconductor market revenue  particularly in the second half of the year 
forecasted consumer demand for pc did not materialize and device pricing fell to levels resulting in unprofitable business for most suppliers 
revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase was mainly driven by increased market share of our touchmatrix product at a major nand flash producer in south korea 
our nor flash revenue decreased at a similar rate to the overall nor flash semiconductor market for the year 
the significant increase in the soc segment is attributed primarily to our acquisition of microprobe and accelerated market adoption of advanced soc probe card technologies in place of the traditional cantilever probe cards 
within microprobe revenue  the vx mp mems and apollo vertical products that are primarily used to test leading edge mobile soc chips and microprocessors  accounted for the majority of its revenues 
revenues by geographic region the following table sets forth our revenues by geographic region for the periods indicated fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands south korea taiwan north america japan asia pacific europe total revenues asia pacific includes all countries in the region except taiwan  south korea  and japan  which are disclosed separately 

table of contents geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we ship the customer product 
for example  if a certain south korean customer purchases through their north american subsidiary and requests the products to be shipped to an address in asia pacific  this sale will be reflected in the revenue for asia pacific rather than north america 
the increases from fiscal to in south korea and asia pacific revenues were related to market share gains and a growing available market for our smartmatrix product at a major dram manufacturer 
south korea revenue also increased due to improved market share of our touchmatrix product at a major nand flash producer 
north america and europe revenue increases were primarily driven by our acquisition of microprobe and the sales of vx mp mems and apollo vertical products 
revenue decreases in taiwan and japan were primarily driven by decreased demand for our dram products due to a weakening global dram market 
gross profit fiscal fiscal in thousands gross profit gross margin gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels  product mix  selling prices  factory loading and material costs 
for fiscal  gross profit increased million compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the benefit of higher gross margins generated from the product lines obtained from our microprobe acquisition in addition to lower material costs  and reduced manufacturing overhead expenses from the existing formfactor production 
manufacturing overhead costs were lower because of the cessation of assembly and test activities in japan and our worldwide reduction in workforce  which combined generated a savings of million for fiscal our gross margin benefited from lower excess inventory charges 
the gross margin improvements were offset by higher direct labor costs relative to revenue levels  service and warranty costs 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by million of additional amortization and depreciation costs for the tangible and intangible assets associated with our microprobe acquisition 
as mentioned above  gross margin for fiscal also improved compared to the prior year due to a million decrease in inventory provision charges 
this improvement is the result of current and ongoing initiatives to improve material planning  procurement and production processes that resulted in the continual reduction in our excess inventory levels 
excess custom inventories are not uncommon for our company because our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times 
this requires us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
in fiscal  the value of previously reserved materials that were used in manufacturing and shipped was million as compared to million in fiscal gross margin included amortization expense on intangible assets for fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense included in gross margin for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to fewer unvested options outstanding being amortized to expense 
in the future  our gross margins may be adversely impacted by lower levels of product revenues  even though we have taken significant steps to reduce our operating cost structure 
our gross margins may also be adversely affected if we are required to record additional inventory provision charges and inventory write downs if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories are below the manufacturing cost of those products 
research and development fiscal fiscal in thousands research and development of revenues 
table of contents research and development expenses for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
our research and development expenses fluctuate as projects transition from development to manufacturing 
depending on the stage of completion and level of effort related to each project undertaken  we may reflect variations in our research and development spending 
as a percent of revenues  research and development expenses decreased in fiscal to as compared to in fiscal primarily due to lower spending 
in fiscal  expenses related to our research and development activities decreased from fiscal primarily due to lower materials costs of million  licensing and equipment costs of million  decrease in depreciation expense of million  partially offset by increased facility and related costs of million 
stock based compensation included within research and development expenses remained flat at million for fiscal as compared to we are continuing our strategic investments in research and development  including investments in new vertical technology directed to testing soc devices  advanced microspring interconnect technology and new process technologies 
in our first quarter of fiscal we announced that we have taken actions to reduce the investments in commodity dram test  but are continuing to develop product capabilities focused on mobile dram 
we suspended development activities specific to our next generation matrix platform  and are consolidating our development and engineering efforts to extend the capabilities of the current matrix platform

restructuring activities during fiscal  we initiated restructuring plans in our second  third and fourth fiscal quarters which resulted in the reduction of our global workforce by full time employees across the organization and the cessation of our assembly and test activities in japan 
we reduced our temporary work force as well 
we recorded million in charges for severance and related benefits  million in contract termination and million in impairment charges for certain equipment and leasehold improvements that would no longer be utilized related to these plans 
as a result of these restructuring plans  we

the liabilities we have accrued for the restructuring plans discussed above represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur and could be subject to adjustment as market conditions change 
the remaining cash payments associated with our various reductions in force are expected to be paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal restructuring activities during fiscal  we initiated restructuring plans in each of our fiscal quarters which resulted in the reduction of our global workforce by full time employees across the organization 
we recorded million in charges for severance and related benefits related to this plan 
in fiscal we executed an amendment to the existing lease arrangement for our facility in singapore which released us from our obligations related to the floor previously utilized for manufacturing in this facility 
we were also granted a rent reduction for the remaining occupied facilities in this building 
we had previously recorded certain asset retirement obligations of million and accruals related to our cessation of the use of these facilities in connection with a prior restructuring action of million

below is a description of the impairment activities for fiscal and in fiscal  we recorded total impairments of million  including million related to terminations of certain construction in progress projects and million related to certain assets which were previously held for sale that were determined to no longer be sellable and used for internal purposes 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we reviewed the recoverability of our long lived assets due to a significant change in our business strategy in connection with our restructuring plan  due to recurring operating losses  net cash outflows from operations and continued decline in the company stock price 
as a result of the review  we concluded our business was able to fully recover the carrying amounts of our assets 
in fiscal  we recorded total impairments of million related to the termination of certain on going projects  including certain software development for internal use that had been recorded in construction in progress 
management believes it is reasonably possible that additional impairment charges that would reduce further the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and intangible assets may arise in fiscal if we are unable to achieve operating results anticipated by our financial plan

the decrease in interest income for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of lower average balances

these dtls exceeded the acquired dtas by million 
the excess dtls allow us to realize a tax benefit by releasing the valuation allowances associated with our dtas 
accordingly  the valuation allowances on a portion of our dtas were released and resulted in an income tax benefit of million

fiscal years ended december  and december  revenues fiscal of fiscal of change revenues revenues in thousands revenues by market dram soc flash total revenues for the global semiconductor market  overall device shipments were generally flat in compared to moderate revenue growth in the global soc and nand flash device markets was masked by a substantial revenue reduction for producers of dram and nor flash devices 
this global dram and nor weakness was particularly severe in the second half of the year as average selling price erosion for semiconductor devices resulted in unprofitable business for most suppliers and a cut back in production capacity 
this weakness in the global dram and nor device market directly resulted in our customers reducing their purchases of  or in some cases canceling existing orders of  our probe cards for dram and nor devices throughout the second half of overall  our revenues decreased by  or million  in fiscal as compared to fiscal our revenue increased approximately year over year in the soc market  but was down approximately in dram and in flash 
these fluctuations in revenue were primarily driven by unit volume 
our revenues for fiscal were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
revenues from sales to dram device manufacturers in fiscal decreased significantly as compared to fiscal as the impact of average selling price erosion of semiconductor devices and the subsequent reduction in production by our customers has limited demand for our advanced wafer probe cards 
our revenues from sales to dram device manufacturers were also impacted in fiscal by flooding in thailand  which dramatically impacted disc drive production resulting in reduced personal computer output and  as a further result  the demand for dram devices 
revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers decreased significantly in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease was driven primarily by decreased demand in the nor flash segment 
moderate growth in the sale of nand flash wafer probe cards offset a portion of this decline 
revenues from sales to soc device manufacturers increased in fiscal compared to the prior year  primarily due to market adoption of more complex devices with higher parallelism and the adoption of mems in place of traditional cantilever cards  both of which positively impacted revenues from sales of our wafer probe cards 
we also qualified an existing customer on our truescale matrix product during fiscal 
table of contents revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth our revenues by geographic region for the periods indicated fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands taiwan south korea japan north america asia pacific europe total revenues asia pacific includes all countries in the region except taiwan  japan and south korea  which are disclosed separately 
geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we ship the customer product 
for example  if a certain south korean customer purchases through their north american subsidiary and requests the products to be shipped to an address in asia pacific  this sale will be reflected in the revenue for asia pacific rather than north america 
the significant decrease in taiwan  asia pacific and north america revenues for the fiscal compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreased demand for our dram products associated with overall weakness in the global dram semiconductor device market 
the increase in south korea revenues is related to the increased demand for our smartmatrix product line for dram  our touchmatrix product line for nand flash  and image sensor products in the soc segment 
the increase in japan revenue for fiscal compared to the prior year was primarily due to the qualification of an existing customer on our truescale matrix product  which was partially offset by a decrease in our dram product sales 
europe revenue declined in fiscal due to the reduced demand for our soc products 
gross profit loss fiscal fiscal in thousands gross profit loss gross margin gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels  product mix  selling prices  factory loading and material costs 
for fiscal  gross margin increased compared to fiscal primarily due to reductions in general overhead cost  lower depreciation expense  reductions in inventory provision charges  higher production yields and favorable changes in product mix to higher margin products 
for fiscal  the increase in gross margin compared to the prior fiscal year included a reduction of million in general overhead expenses resulting from our cost control initiatives and decision to cease manufacturing in singapore and korea 
the increase in gross margin also included million of lower depreciation expense resulting primarily from the fiscal enterprise wide impairment 
for fiscal  gross margin also improved compared to the prior year due to a million decrease in inventory provision charges 
this improvement is the result of current and on going initiatives to improve materials planning  procurement and production processes that resulted in reductions in our excess inventory levels 
excess custom inventories are not uncommon for our company because our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times 
this requires us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
in fiscal  the value of previously reserved materials that were used in manufacturing and shipped was million as compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents gross margin included stock based compensation of  million and million for fiscal and  respectively  with the decrease being primarily due to declining stock prices  decreased headcount and a reduction in the number of awards granted  partially offset by expense related to current year grants 
in the future  our gross margins may be adversely impacted by lower levels of product revenues  even though we have taken significant steps to reduce our operating cost structure 
our gross margins may also be adversely affected if we are required to record additional inventory provision charges and inventory write downs if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories are below the manufacturing cost of those products 
research and development fiscal fiscal in thousands research and development of revenues research and development expenses for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to the decrease in certain new technology product development related costs and the decrease in other costs as a result of our cost reduction efforts

these charges consisted of termination benefits related to reductions in work force of full time positions  which were all related to severance and related benefits 
the activities related to this action were completed during fiscal subsequently  in the second quarter of fiscal we undertook a plan to rescind the previously issued severance arrangements for certain employees impacted by this plan  resulting in the reversal of million of the accrual for severance costs booked in conjunction with the q restructuring plan  including the accrued retention bonus to date 
we completed this rescission plan in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a series of corporate initiatives  including a reduction in workforce  which represented a renewed focus on streamlining and simplifying our operations as well as reducing our quarterly operating costs the q restructuring plan 
these actions included a reduction in workforce impacting employees spread across all functions of the organization  as well as a reduction in the scope of the previously contemplated manufacturing operations in korea  resulting in a reduction of workforce of employees related to the assembly and test function 
we recorded million in charges for the q restructuring plan during fiscal for severance and related benefits 
additionally  in conjunction with the q restructuring plan we identified certain equipment and software assets related to our assembly and test operations in korea that would no longer be utilized 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million during fiscal  representing the net book value of these assets 
the activities comprising this reduction in force were completed during fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring plan the q restructuring plan to cease the transition of manufacturing operations to singapore 
this decision resulted in a reduction in force of employees at our singapore facility 
the manufacturing activities that were scheduled to be transitioned to singapore remained in livermore  and livermore continued as the primary manufacturing operating location for the company 
in conjunction with the q restructuring plan  we also undertook a reduction in force of two additional individuals in our livermore operations 
we recorded charges of million for severance and related benefits and impairment charges of million for certain equipment and leasehold improvements in singapore that would no longer be utilized in conjunction with the q restructuring plan 
the activities related to this restructuring plan were completed during fiscal in addition  due to the combined effect of the significant change in our business strategy in connection with the q restructuring plan  recurring operating losses and the sustained decline in the company stock price  we reviewed the recoverability of our long lived assets in the third quarter of fiscal  as discussed in note impairment of long lived assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements

benefit from income taxes fiscal fiscal in thousands benefit from income taxes effective tax rate we recorded an income tax benefit of million for each of the fiscal years and the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal primarily relates to a million release of the deferred tax valuation allowance for a non us jurisdiction  offset by income tax expense in certain of our non us operations in foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal primarily related to the settlement of a non us tax jurisdiction audit  offset by tax expense related to our non us operations in foreign jurisdictions 
during the fiscal quarter ended june   we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets of a non us jurisdiction will be realized after considering all positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence included finalization of our current restructuring activity for the related foreign jurisdiction and conclusion that such location will continue to be in operation for the foreseeable future  as well as a forecast of future taxable income sufficient to realize such 
table of contents deferred tax assets prior to the expiration of existing net operating loss carry forwards due to a change in the entity structure to a cost plus arrangement 
accordingly  a deferred tax valuation allowance release of million was recorded as an income tax benefit during the quarter 
our conclusion that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized is strongly influenced by the expectation that such location will continue to be in operation for the foreseeable future 
we believe such conclusion is reasonable in light of our current operational structure and forecasted operations  both for the foreign jurisdiction and our consolidated operations  however  such conclusion is inherently uncertain 
therefore  if we have material unforeseen losses or are required to restructure our non us operations to further align our operating expense structure with our expected revenues  then its ability to generate sufficient income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets may be reduced and an additional charge to increase the valuation allowance may be recorded 
we recognize interest charges and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision

liquidity and capital resources capital resources our working capital was million at december  and million at december  the decrease in working capital in the year ended december  was primarily due to the net cash used in our operating activities and cash used to acquire microprobe 
cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits held at banks  money market funds  us government securities and commercial papers that at the time of purchase had maturities of days or less 
marketable securities consist of us government and agency securities and commercial papers 
we typically invest in highly rated securities with low probabilities of default 
our investment policy requires investments to be rated single a or better  limits the types of acceptable investments  concentration as to security holder and duration of the investment 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities included million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december  the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances was primarily due to the net cash used in our operating activities and cash used to acquire microprobe in fiscal we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
if we are unsuccessful in improving our operating efficiency  reducing our cash outlays or increasing our available cash through financing  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will further decline in fiscal we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed 
as part of these strategies  we indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings 
should we require additional capital in the united states  we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt 
if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds  the united states income tax impact would be zero due to our net operating loss carry forward position 
we would be subject to a small withholding tax in certain international countries for a total of approximately  day sales outstanding days sales outstanding from receivables  or dso  were days at december  compared with days at december  our dso is calculated using the count back method and is based on gross 
table of contents accounts receivable including accounts receivable for amounts in deferred revenue 
the increase in dso is primarily due to the acquisition of microprobe where certain key customers were granted payment terms of up to days which is slightly longer than we have historically provided

this was offset by non cash expenses of million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation and amortization and million of provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal was million  net of the operating assets and liabilities assumed from the microprobe acquisition 
the net change was comprised of a decrease in our accounts receivable of million  excluding the effect of the accounts receivables assumed in the microprobe acquisition  due to our improved collection of payments from customers as well as shortened payment terms for certain customers and a million increase in deferred revenues due to shipments to customers for which our revenue recognition criteria have not yet been met  offset in part by a decrease of million in accounts payable driven by payments for vendor obligations assumed in the microprobe acquisition which were past due  and a decrease of million in income taxes payable due to the release of a reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the lapsing of the statute of limitations in the us jurisdiction 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was primarily attributable to our net loss of million offset in part by million of non cash charges consisting primarily of million of stock based compensation  million of depreciation and amortization  and million of provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
this was offset by a benefit of million resulting from changes in deferred tax assets and a gain of million related to non cash restructuring activity 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal was million comprising a decrease in our accounts receivable of million due to our improved collection of payments from customers with extended payment terms as well as shortened payment terms for certain customers and a million reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the collection of certain amounts received in relation to the liquidation of electroglas as part of the finalization of its bankruptcy proceedings  offset in part by a decrease of million in accrued liabilities  primarily those related to payroll and bonus  as well as our restructuring actions  and a decrease of million in accounts payable driven by the timing of our payments to vendors and reduced spending levels resulting from our cost reduction initiatives

our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities declined in fiscal we continue to focus on improving our operating efficiency to achieve break even operating cash flow

we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
to the extent necessary  we may also consider establishing manufacturing and technology partnerships  or to seek short and long term debt obligations  or to obtain new financing facilities which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
however  if we are unsuccessful in improving our operating efficiency  executing our cost reduction plan  reducing our cash outlays or increasing our available cash through financing  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will further decline in fiscal contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our significant commitments to make future payments in cash under contractual obligations as of december  payments due in fiscal years after total in thousands operating leases other purchase obligations capital leases total other purchase obligations are primarily for purchases of inventory and manufacturing related service contracts 
for the purposes of this table  other purchase obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the table above excludes our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled approximately million as of december  and are classified in deferred taxes and other long term tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors 
accordingly  the timing of payment cannot be estimated and has been excluded from the table above 
as of december   the changes to our uncertain tax positions in the next months that are reasonable and probable are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements historically  we have not participated in transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification agreements we may  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that include indemnification obligations 
under these contractual arrangements  we have agreed to defend  indemnify and or hold the third party harmless from and against certain liabilities 
these arrangements include indemnities in favor of customers in the event that our wafer probe cards infringe a third party intellectual property and our lessors in connection with facility 
table of contents leasehold liabilities that we may cause 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers  and our bylaws contain indemnification obligations in favor of our directors  officers and agents 
these indemnity arrangements may limit the type of the claim  the total amount that we can be required to pay in connection with the indemnification obligation and the time within which an indemnification claim can be made 
the duration of the indemnification obligation may vary  and for most arrangements  survives the agreement term and is indefinite 
we believe that substantially all of our indemnity arrangements provide either for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make  or for limitations on the types of claims and damages we could be obligated to indemnify  or for both 
however  it is not possible to determine or reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification obligations due to the varying terms of such obligations  the history of prior indemnification claims  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular contractual arrangement and in each potential future claim for indemnification  and the contingency of any potential liabilities upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable 
we have not had any requests for indemnification under these arrangements 
our management believes that any liability for these indemnity arrangements would not be material to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification arrangements on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  recent accounting pronouncements please refer to the discussion of our recent accounting pronouncements in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct certain operations in foreign currencies 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion  but not all  of existing foreign currency denominated amounts 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in other income 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on the currency forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we recognized a net loss of million and a net gain of million for fiscal and  respectively  from the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and the valuation of these hedge contracts in our consolidated statements of operations under other income  net 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in a number of securities including us agency discount notes  money market funds and commercial paper 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high grade investment securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to an issuer  except us treasuries and us agencies 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposures nor do we invest for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at december  and december  would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than million and million  respectively
