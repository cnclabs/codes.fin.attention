item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
selected relationships within the consolidated statements of operations years ended august  dollars in thousands revenues net income add net loss attributable to non controlling interest net income attributable to chase corporation increase in revenues from prior year amount percentage increase decrease in net income  net of taxes from prior year amount percentage percentage of revenues revenues expenses cost of products and services sold selling  general and administrative expenses acquisition related costs income before income taxes income taxes net income overview benefitting from having the operating results of neptco  which was acquired in june  included for the full fiscal year  the company set record highs in fiscal for both revenues and net income 
additionally  favorable product mix and our continued efforts to consolidate production facilities  streamline operations and reduce overhead costs have improved our profitability 
revenues from the industrial materials segment exceeded prior year results primarily due to the inclusion of sales from neptco as well as increased sales from our electronic coatings  laminated durable paper  and wire and cable products 
these favorable sales were partially offset by a reduction in our product sales to our aerospace and transportation markets compared to those realized in the prior year 
revenues from our construction materials segment were slightly down from the prior year primarily due to decreased project demand earlier in the fiscal year from our pipeline coatings products produced at our uk facility 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our pipeline products and coating and lining systems  as well as increased demand for our private label products  which are all manufactured domestically 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we started to see increased order activity for certain middle east infrastructure project work that was previously delayed 
in the upcoming fiscal year  we will continue with our integration of neptco operations  as well as our global erp system implementation which was initiated in fiscal and will continue through december additionally  consolidation efforts will remain a priority and other key strategies will include targeted marketing initiatives supported by new product development  as well as continued emphasis on identifying potential acquisition targets 
our balance sheet continues to remain strong  with cash on hand of million and a current ratio of our million line of credit is fully available  while the balance of our term debt is million

revenues in our industrial materials segment increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in revenues from our industrial materials segment in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of a  from neptco product offerings which we acquired in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year  b  from our global electronic coatings product line  and c  from our laminated durable paper products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales in the aerospace and transportation market of  revenues from our construction materials segment decreased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  for fiscal the decreased sales from our construction materials segment in fiscal was primarily due to reduced sales of  in pipeline products produced at our uk facility as a result of lower project demand primarily in the middle east  as well as decreased sales of 
table of contents  from our highway construction products 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of a  from our coating and lining systems  b  from pipeline products produces at our north america facilities  and c  from our private label products due to increased demand from some of our key customers 
royalties and commissions in the industrial materials segment were   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the increase in royalties and commissions in both fiscal and over fiscal was due to increased sales of electronic coating products by our licensed manufacturer in asia 
export sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the growth in our export sales in both fiscal and was due to export sales from our neptco products 
total revenues in fiscal increased  or to  from  in the prior year 
revenues in our industrial materials segment increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in revenues from our industrial materials segment in fiscal was primarily due to a sales of  from neptco operations  which we acquired in june  b increased sales of  from our wire and cable product line as we continued to benefit from strong demand in the power cable and communication cable markets  and c increased sales of  from our laminated durable paper products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales in the aerospace and transportation market of  revenues from our construction materials segment increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  for fiscal the increased sales from our construction materials segment in fiscal were primarily due to increased sales of a  from our pipeline products due to greater demand for products produced at our uk facility  b  from our highway construction products  and c  from our private label products due to increased demand from some of our key customers 
cost of products and services sold cost of products and services sold increased  or to  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold remained flat at in fiscal and fiscal the following table summarizes the relative percentages of costs of products and services sold to revenues for both of our operating segments fiscal years ended august  cost of products and services sold industrial materials construction materials total cost of products and services sold in our industrial materials segment was  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in this segment remained relatively flat year over year 
the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by the following a a full year of costs of the neptco jv  which has higher cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues  as opposed to the prior year only including two months of the neptco jv costs acquired in june  b the current year includes expenses of  due to the fair value inventory step up related to the neptco acquisition  and c the current year includes accrued transition costs of  related to our move from our randolph plant 
these increases in costs were offset by a more favorable product sales mix in the current fiscal year  as well as the inclusion of the following costs in the prior fiscal year a expense of  due to the fair value inventory step up related to the neptco acquisition  b moving expenses of  related to our plant transition from webster to oxford and camberley to winnersh  c accrued transition costs of  related to our move from our randolph plant  and d certain supplier inconsistencies that resulted in excess waste and incremental expenses of  related to the utilization of specialized testing facilities for analyzing incoming raw materials for proper specifications 

table of contents cost of products and services sold in our construction materials segment was  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in the construction materials segment decreased slightly due to a positive sales mix earlier in the fiscal year as we had increased sales of higher margin products coupled with decreased sales of lower margin products 
in fiscal  cost of products and services sold increased  or to  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold increased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal cost of products and services sold in our industrial materials segment was  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in this segment increased due to the fair value inventory step up related to the neptco acquisition  the moving expenses related to our plant transitions to oxford and winnersh  the accrued transition costs related to our randolph plant  and supplier inconsistencies  each of which is noted above 
cost of products and services sold in our construction materials segment was  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in the construction materials segment increased primarily due to higher raw material costs  increased sales of lower margin products  and decreased sales of higher margin products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal the dollar increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased sales as well as incremental expenses from neptco  which was acquired in june  and included amortization of additional intangible assets of  additionally  the current year includes  of pension related settlement costs due to the timing of lump sum distributions  as well as  of increased incentive compensation expense due to the fiscal financial results  increased incentive compensation for neptco employees  and overall plan design 
as a percentage of revenues  however  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of total revenues in fiscal compared to for fiscal the percentage decrease is attributable to management continued emphasis on controlling costs  including reduced travel  advertising  and other selling related expenses 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to our continued emphasis on controlling costs and leveraging fixed overhead 
in fiscal  we had recoveries of previously identified bad debt that exceeded additions to bad debt expense for the year  resulting in a net gain of  the gain of  in fiscal compared to bad debt expense  net of recoveries  of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in bad debt expense in fiscal was primarily due to financial difficulties for some of our international customers as well as overall increased receivable balances due to higher sales 
we continue with our strict adherence to our established credit policies and continue to closely monitor the accounts receivable function while taking a proactive approach to the collections process 
acquisition related costs in fiscal  we incurred  of acquisition costs related to our acquisition of neptco 
this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the accounting standards  and as such all related professional service fees ie  banking  legal  accounting  actuarial  etc 
were expensed as incurred during the year ended august  interest expense interest expense increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal is a direct result of incurring a full year of interest expense on the term note related to the june acquisition of neptco 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal primarily due to the neptco acquisition financing 

table of contents other income other income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal other income primarily includes interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
the increase in other income in fiscal as compared to the prior year is primarily due to foreign exchange gains driven by the strengthening of the pound sterling during the current fiscal year 
other income decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  other income includes a gain of  recognized on deposit payments previously received on the sale of our evanston  il property 
we took back control and ownership of this leased asset which was previously sold by us under a seller financing arrangement 
the increase in other income is partially offset by the foreign exchange losses caused by the continued weakening of both the pound sterling and the euro 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in all three years  we have received the benefit of the domestic production deduction and foreign rate differential 
the increased effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to a less favorable effective state income tax rate than realized in the prior fiscal year 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal compares unfavorably to due to non deductible acquisition related expenses  offset by a favorable effective state income tax rate 
non controlling interest the net loss from non controlling interest relates to a joint venture in which we have  through our neptco subsidiary  a ownership interest 
the joint venture between neptco and its joint venture partner an otherwise unrelated party is managed and operated on a day to day basis by neptco 
the purpose of this joint venture is to combine the elements of each member fiber optic strength businesses 
net income attributable to chase corporation net income in fiscal increased  or to  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net income in fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of neptco  and the favorable mix on product sales as discussed previously 
these increases were partially offset by expenses related to the acceleration of defined benefit plan settlement costs of  resulting from the timing of lump sum distributions to participants 
additionally  net income in the prior year period was negatively impacted by the following a  in acquisition related expenses  b expenses of  in inventory fair value step up related to the neptco acquisition  c plant transition and moving expenses of  and d accelerated pension settlement charges of  resulting from the timing of lump sum distributions 
net income in fiscal decreased  or to  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in net income in fiscal was a result of the following factors a  in acquisition related expenses  b expenses of  in inventory fair value step up related to the neptco acquisition  and c acceleration of defined benefit plan settlement costs of  resulting from the timing of lump sum distributions to participants 
in addition  there was an increase in plant transition and moving expenses of  during fiscal other important performance measures we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful performance measures 
they are used by our executive management team and board of directors to measure operating performance  to allocate resources  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors and investors concerning our financial performance 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures 
we define ebitda as follows net income attributable to chase corporation before interest expense from borrowings  income tax expense  depreciation expense from fixed assets  and amortization from intangible assets 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda excluding costs related to our acquisitions  costs of products sold related to inventory step up to fair value  and settlement gains or losses resulting from lump sum distributions to participants from our defined benefit plan 

table of contents the use of ebitda and adjusted ebitda has limitations and these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as an alternative to  us gaap measures such as net income 
our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to chase corporation  the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with us gaap  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the periods presented years ended august  net income attributable to chase corporation interest expense income taxes depreciation expense amortization expense ebitda acquisition related costs a cost of sale of inventory step up b pension curtailment and settlement costs c adjusted ebitda a represents costs related to our june acquisition of neptco b represents expenses related to the step up in fair value of inventory through purchase accounting from the june acquisition of neptco c represents pension related curtailment and settlement costs due to the timing of lump sum distributions liquidity and sources of capital our cash balance increased  to  at august  from  at august  this was a result of cash flows generated from operations during the fiscal year  offset by principal payments on outstanding debt  equipment purchases  and payment of our fiscal annual dividend 
our cash balance increased  to  at august  from  at august  the increased cash balance at august  was a result of cash flows generated from operations during the fiscal year and  in cash acquired as part of the neptco acquisition  offset by principal payments on outstanding debt  equipment purchases  and payment of our annual dividend 
cash provided by operations was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income  offset by decreased accrued expenses and increased inventory balances 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and decreased inventory as a result of higher sales volumes  offset by decreased accounts payable and increased accounts receivable balances 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income offset by increased purchases of inventory  as we strategically built up our inventory to facilitate certain manufacturing plant transition plans  and made bulk purchases of key raw materials to take advantage of favorable pricing terms 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of august  compared to as of august  the increase in our current ratio at august  was primarily attributable to an increase in our overall cash balance due to cash flows generated from operations during the fiscal year  as well as the classification of the insulfab product line assets being held for sale as of fiscal year end see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  cash used in investing activities was primarily due to  paid for purchases of machinery and equipment at our manufacturing locations  and  of professional legal services for new patent work that have been capitalized as intangibles 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities was primarily due to payments totaling  net of cash 
table of contents acquired  for the acquisition of neptco and  paid for purchases of machinery and equipment at our manufacturing locations 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities was primarily due to  paid for machinery and equipment and improvements made for our oxford  ma facility   paid for machinery and equipment and improvements made for our facility in o hara township  pa   paid related to the build out of our leased property in winnersh  uk  and cash paid for purchases of machinery and equipment at our other manufacturing locations 
these cash outflows were partially offset by additional proceeds during fiscal of  received from the sale of our chase ems business 
cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended august  compared to cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal and cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal during fiscal  cash used in finance activities was primarily due to our annual dividend payment and payments made on the bank loans used to finance our acquisition of neptco 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from  in term debt used to finance our acquisition of neptco  offset by payments of  to retire our previously held term notes with bank of america and rbs citizens  payments on our line of credit arrangement  and payment of our annual dividend 
additionally  we paid the final two scheduled promissory note payments of  each to the former cim shareholders in accordance with the cim stock purchase agreement  described in more detail below 
during fiscal  cash used in financing activities reflected our annual dividend payment and payments made on the bank loans we used to finance our prior year acquisitions of cim and serviwrap 
additionally  we paid the first of three scheduled promissory note payments of  to the cim shareholders in accordance with the cim stock purchase agreement 
on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share totaling  to shareholders of record on october  and payable on december  on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share totaling  to shareholders of record on november  and payable on december  on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share totaling approximately  to shareholders of record on november  and payable on december  in june  as part of our acquisition of neptco  we borrowed  under a five year term debt financing arrangement led and arranged by bank of america  with participation from rbs citizens the credit facility 
the applicable interest rate is based on the effective libor plus a range of to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
at august   the applicable interest rate was per annum and the outstanding principal amount was  we are required to repay the principal amount of the term loan in quarterly installments of  which began in september and continue through june  increasing to  per quarter thereafter through june  and to  per quarter thereafter through march the credit facility matures in june prepayment of the credit facility is allowed at any time 
as part of the financing for this acquisition  we also obtained a new revolving line of credit with bank of america the revolver totaling  which replaced our then existing  line 
the revolver bears interest at libor plus a range of to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  or  at our option  at the bank base lending rate 
as of august  and october   the entire amount of  was available for use 
the revolver is scheduled to mature in june this revolver allows for increased flexibility for working capital requirements going forward  and we plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs  including potential acquisitions  in fiscal and future periods 
our credit agreement with bank of america  which outlines the terms of both the credit facility and the revolver  contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
it also requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit agreement of no more than to  and to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as calculated in the credit agreement of at least to 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of august  we currently have several on going capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals 
machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants 

table of contents we may also consider the acquisition of companies or other assets this year or in future periods which are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing resources  including cash on hand and our revolver  together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings  will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that interest rates increase in future periods  we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at august  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations total payments due less than year payments due years payments due years payments after years dollars in thousands long term debt including estimated interest operating leases capital leases purchase obligations total we may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of  as of august  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
this table does not include the expected payments for our obligations for pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
as of august   we had recognized an accrued benefit liability of  representing the unfunded benefit obligations of the pension benefit plans 
see note benefits and pension plans to the consolidated financial statements for further information  including expected pension benefit payments for the next years 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu amends asc  intangibles goodwill and other to allow entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
under that option  an entity no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this asu expands the presentation of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the total change of each component of other comprehensive income either on the face of the net income statement or as a separate disclosure in the notes 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this asu is only disclosure related and will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  comprehensive income or cash flows 
asu will become effective for us in fiscal 
table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company financial condition and operating results  and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer ability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
we estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and record adjustments to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges 
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets  using a variety of methods and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
the method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset  including a market participant use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for us are expensed immediately 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
we review long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
when evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill we first assess a range of qualitative factors  including but not limited to  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel  and the overall financial performance for each of our reporting units relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
if after completing this assessment  it is determined that it is more that than likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we then proceed to a two step impairment testing methodology using the income approach discounted cash flow method 

table of contents in the first step of this testing methodology  we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value  as determined by its estimated discounted cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then complete the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of impairment to be recognized 
in the second step  we estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including intangible assets 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference in that period 
when required  we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology which includes estimates of future cash flows to be generated by particular assets  as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of those anticipated cash flows 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and includes making assumptions about projected growth rates  industry specific factors  working capital requirements  current and anticipated operating conditions  any terminal sales value at the end of the period under review 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenues we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of our obligation is complete  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting 
this is typically at the time of shipment or upon receipt by the customer based on contractual terms 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment by customers 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific customer contracts and shipment terms  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of operating income 
commissions are recognized when earned and payments are received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 
contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal the guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our accounting for uncertain tax positions 
deferred income taxes we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based compensation at fair value  including estimated forfeitures  and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair 
table of contents value of stock options 
this model requires significant estimates related to the award expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we are also required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
pension benefits we sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering employees of certain divisions of the company 
in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions include discount rates  benefits earned  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense 
effective december   the defined benefit pension plan was amended to include a soft freeze whereby any employee hired after the effective date of december  will not be admitted to the plan 
the only exception relates to employees of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union whose contract was amended recently to include a soft freeze whereby any employees hired after the effective date of july  will not be admitted to the plan 
all eligible participants who were previously admitted to the plan prior to the december  and july  soft freeze dates  respectively  will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements 
neptco has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our union employees at our pawtucket  ri plant 
this plan was frozen effective october   and as a result  no new participants can enter the plan and the benefits of current participants were frozen as of that date 
the benefits are based on years of service and the employee average compensation during the earlier of five years before retirement  or october  we account for our pension plans following the requirements of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits asc 
asc requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan  b measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on our earnings 
in the event of significant inflation  our efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate
