overview we are the world s leading online social game developer with approximately million average maus for the three months ended december  we have launched some of the most successful social games in the industry in each of the last three years 
our games are accessible on facebook and other social networks  mobile platforms and zynga 
com 
our games are generally available for free  and we generate revenue through the in game sale of virtual goods  mobile game download fees and advertising 
we are a pioneer and innovator of social games and a leader in making play a core activity on the internet 
our objective is to become the worldwide leader in play by connecting the world through games 
consistent with our free to play business model  compared to all players who play our games in any period  only a small portion of our players are payers 
because the opportunity for social interactions increases as the number of players increases  we believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of players  including the number of players who may not purchase virtual goods  is important to the success of our business 
as a result  we believe that the number of players who choose to purchase virtual goods will continue to constitute a small portion of our overall players as our business grows 
the games that constitute our top games vary over time but historically the top three revenue generating games in any period contributed the majority of our revenue 
our top three games accounted for  and of our online game revenue in  and  respectively 
the percentage of online game revenue related to our top three games has declined during these periods as we continue to launch new games 
these more recently launched games increased our total online game revenue without necessarily being included as a top three game 
we made significant investments in to drive long term growth 
we continue to invest in game development  creating both new games and new features and content in existing games designed to engage our players 
we are also investing in other key areas of our business  including international market development  rmg  mobile games  our technology infrastructure and our with friends network 
in  we expect to make capital expenditures of up to million as we invest in network infrastructure to continue to improve the player experience 
how we generate revenue we operate our games as live services that allow players to play for free 
we generate revenue primarily from the in game sale of virtual goods and advertising 
revenue growth will depend largely on our ability to attract and retain players and more effectively monetize our player base through the sale of virtual goods and advertising 
we intend to do this through the launch of new games  enhancements to current games and expansion into new markets and distribution platforms 
online game 
we provide our players with the opportunity to purchase virtual goods that enhance their game playing experience 
we believe players choose to pay for virtual goods for the same reasons they are 
table of contents willing to pay for other forms of entertainment 
they enjoy the additional playing time or added convenience  the ability to personalize their own game boards  the satisfaction of leveling up and the opportunity for sharing creative expressions 
we believe players are more likely to purchase virtual goods when they are connected to and playing with their friends  whether those friends play for free or also purchase virtual goods 
players may also elect to pay a one time download fee to obtain an ad free mobile game 
facebook is currently the primary distribution  marketing  promotion and payment platform for our games 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue through the facebook platform and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
for example  for the twelve months ended december  and  we estimate that and of our bookings  respectively  was generated through the facebook platform  while and of our bookings  respectively  were generated through mobile platforms 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we estimate that and of our revenue  respectively  were generated through the facebook platform  while and of our revenue  respectively  were generated through mobile platforms 
we have had to estimate this information because certain payment methods we accept and advertising networks do not allow us to determine the platform used 
we began migrating to facebook credits in july pursuant to an addendum to facebook s standard terms and conditions  and in april  we completed this migration 
contractually  facebook remits to us an amount equal to of the price stated to our players for use in our games 
we recognize revenue net of amounts retained by facebook 
prior to our migration to facebook credits  we used third party payment processors and paid these processors service fees ranging from to of the purchase price of our virtual goods which were recorded in cost of revenue 
players can purchase facebook credits from facebook directly through our games or through game cards purchased from retailers and distributors 
in june  facebook announced its plans to discontinue the use of facebook credits and instead support pricing in local currencies 
we expect to begin our transition away from facebook credits and to adopt facebook s local currency based payments model in the first half of on platforms other than facebook  players purchase our virtual goods through various widely accepted payment methods offered in the games  including credit cards  paypal  apple itunes accounts and direct wires 
players can purchase game cards from retailers and distributors that can be redeemed in our games 
advertising 
advertising revenue primarily includes branded virtual goods and sponsorships  engagement ads and offers  mobile ads  display ads and licensing 
we generally report our advertising revenue net of amounts due to advertising agencies and brokers 
key metrics we regularly review a number of metrics  including the following key financial and operating metrics  to evaluate our business  measure our performance  identify trends in our business  prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions 
key financial metrics bookings 
bookings is a non gaap financial measure that is equal to revenue recognized during the period plus the change in deferred revenue during the period 
we record the sale of virtual goods and mobile downloads as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average payer life or as the virtual goods are consumed 
advertising sales which consist of certain branded virtual goods and sponsorships are also deferred and recognized over the estimated average life of the branded virtual good  similar to online game revenue 
bookings  as opposed to revenue  is the fundamental top line metric we use to manage our business  as we believe it is a better indicator of the sales activity in a given period 
over the long term  the factors impacting our bookings and revenue are the same 
however  in the short term  there are factors that may cause revenue to exceed or be less than bookings in any period 

table of contents we use bookings to evaluate the results of our operations  generate future operating plans and assess the performance of our company 
while we believe that this non gaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business  this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenue recognized in accordance with us gaap 
in addition  other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate bookings differently or not at all  which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that we calculate as net income loss  adjusted for provision for benefit from income taxes  other income expense  net  interest income  gain loss from legal settlements  depreciation and amortization  stock based expense  impairment of intangible assets  restructuring charges and change in deferred revenue 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors 
for a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda  see the section titled non gaap financial measures included in item selected consolidated financial data of this annual report on form k 
key operating metrics we manage our business by tracking several operating metrics daus  which measure daily active users of our games  maus  which measure monthly active users of our games  muus  which measure monthly unique users of our games  mups  which measure monthly unique payers in our games  and abpu  which measures our average daily bookings per average dau  each of which is recorded by our internal analytics systems 
daus 
we define daus as the number of individuals who played one of our games during a particular day 
under this metric  an individual who plays two different games on the same day is counted as two daus 
similarly  an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms eg web and mobile or on two different social networks on the same day would be counted as two daus 
average daus for a particular period is the average of the daus for each day during that period 
we use daus as a measure of audience engagement 
maus 
we define maus as the number of individuals who played a particular game in the day period ending with the measurement date 
under this metric  an individual who plays two different games in the same day period is counted as two maus 
similarly  an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms eg  web and mobile or on two different social networks in a day period would be counted as two maus 
average maus for a particular period is the average of the maus at each month end during that period 
we use maus as a measure of total game audience size 
muus 
we define muus as the number of unique individuals who played any of our games on a particular platform in the day period ending with the measurement date 
an individual who plays more than one of our games in a given day period would be counted as a single muu 
however  because we cannot always distinguish unique individuals playing across multiple platforms  an individual who plays any of our games on two different platforms eg  web and mobile in a given day period may be counted as two muus in the event that we do not have data that allows us to de duplicate the player 
because many of our players play more than one game in a given day period  muus are always lower than maus in any given time period 
average muus for a particular period is the average of the muus at each month end during that period 
we use muus as a measure of total audience reach across our network of games 
mups 
we define mups as the number of unique players who made a payment at least once during the applicable month through a payment method for which we can quantify the number of unique payers  including payers from certain of our mobile games 
mups does not include payers who use certain payment methods for which we cannot quantify the number of unique payers 
if a player made a payment in our games on two separate platforms eg  facebook and google in a period  the player would be counted as two unique payers in that period 
mups are presented as an average of the three months in the applicable quarter 

table of contents abpu 
we define abpu as i our total bookings in a given period  divided by ii the number of days in that period  divided by  iii the average daus during the period 
we believe that abpu provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results in the same manner as our management and board of directors 
we use abpu as a measure of overall monetization across all of our players through the sale of virtual goods and advertising 
our business model for social games is designed so that  as there are more players that play our games  social interactions increase and the more valuable the games and our business become 
all engaged players of our games help drive our bookings and  consequently  both online game revenue and advertising revenue 
virtual goods are purchased by players who are socializing with  competing against or collaborating with other players  most of whom do not buy virtual goods 
accordingly  we primarily focus on bookings  daus  maus  muus  mups and abpu  which together we believe best reflect key audience metrics 
for the three months ended dec  sep  jun  mar  dec  sep  jun  mar  users and payers in millions average daus average maus average muus average mups na na abpu na means data is not available 
the increase in daus  maus and muus for the three months ended march  as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily the result of the release of castleville  which launched in the fourth quarter of and reached seven million daus in two weeks  and hidden chronicles  which launched in the first quarter of additionally we released four titles on mobile platforms 
the increase in daus for the three months ended june  as compared to the prior quarter was the result of new users from draw something  a game we acquired through the omgpop acquisition 
daus and muus decreased in the three months ended september  as compared to the prior quarter  primarily due to declines in the performance of draw something 
the decrease in daus  maus and muus for the three months ended december  as compared to the prior quarter was the result of declines in web players and mobile players 
future growth in audience and engagement will depend on our ability to retain current players  attract new players  launch new games and expand into new markets and distribution platforms 
our daus  maus and muus all increased in the three months ended march   primarily due to the launch of cityville in december  the addition of new content to existing games and the launch of several mobile initiatives 
in the third and fourth quarters of  daus declined compared to the first two quarters of the year  mainly due to a decline in players of our more mature games 
however  during that same period we saw an increase in maus and abpu as we continued to expand our reach as a result of new game launches and improve our monetization as a result of both new game launches and increased bookings from advertising 

table of contents other metrics although our management primarily focuses on the operating metrics above  we also monitor periodic trends in paying players of our games 
the table below shows average monthly unique payer bookings  average mups and unique payer bookings per unique payer for the last six quarters 
these metrics are not available for the first and second quarters of due to mobile payer data not becoming available until the third quarter of for the three months ended dec  sep  jun  mar  dec  sep  jun  mar  average monthly unique payer bookings in thousands  na na average mups in millions na na monthly unique payer bookings per mup na na na means data is not available 
average monthly unique payer bookings represent the monthly average amount of bookings for the applicable quarter that we received through payment methods for which we can quantify the number of unique payers and excludes bookings generated from certain mobile payers in the first quarter of due to our acquisition of omgpop late in that quarter  as well as bookings from certain payment methods for which we cannot quantify the number of unique payers 
also excluded are bookings from advertising 
monthly unique payer bookings per mup is calculated by dividing average monthly unique payer bookings by average mups 
average monthly unique payer bookings decreased in the second and third quarters of monthly unique payer bookings per mup decreased from in the first quarter of to in the second quarter of  due to an increase in mups in our mobile games  which generally monetize at a lower rate than our web games 
monthly unique payer bookings per mup increased to in the third quarter of  due to fewer mobile mups 
in the initial launch period of mobile games  such as the second quarter of that included the first full quarter of new payers from draw something  we have seen increased mups due to one time paid download fees that tend to decline in subsequent periods after which in game spending comprises a greater percentage of mobile bookings 
although we monitor our unique payer metrics  we focus on monetization  including through in game advertising  of all of our players and not just our payers 
accordingly  we strive to enhance content and our players game experience to increase our bookings and abpu  which is a measure of overall monetization across all of our players through the sale of virtual goods and advertising 
future growth in audience and engagement will depend on our ability to retain current players  attract new players  launch new games and expand into new markets and distribution platforms  and the success of the zynga platform 
our operating metrics may not correlate directly to quarterly bookings or revenue trends in the short term 
recent developments game launches 
we launched games in  including titles on web platforms and titles on mobile platforms 
in the fourth quarter of  our releases included bubble safari ocean  cityville  coasterville and the friend game on web platforms and ayakashi and party place on mobile platforms 
mobile growth 
in we saw and year over year growth in bookings and revenue  respectively  on mobile platforms as our players continued to play our games on their phones and tablets 
in order to deliver on our mission of connecting the world through games  we are also 
table of contents developing the with friends network  our own social gaming network for web and mobile players 
we will continue to invest heavily in developing our mobile platform to ensure our players can continue to play our games anywhere  anytime 
rmg 
in october we entered into an exclusive partnership agreement with bwin 
party  a leading international rmg operator  to develop  test and operate certain real money online poker and casino games in the united kingdom 
we expect to launch our first rmg products in the first half of  which include table games such as slots  roulette and blackjack 
in december  we filed an application for a preliminary finding of suitability with the nevada gaming control board 
cost reduction and product prioritization 
we have implemented cost reduction initiatives to better align our operating expenses with our revenue  including a reduction in force of employees  or approximately of our current workforce  and also steps to rationalize our product pipeline  reduce marketing expenses and consolidate certain facilities  and we plan to continue to manage costs 
operating results 
our operating results declined as compared to total bookings decreased by and adjusted ebitda decreased by compared to these results primarily reflect weakness of certain games within our invest and express category and include an impairment charge of million excluding any tax impact related to the intangible assets previously acquired in connection with our purchase of omgpop 
facebook agreement 
in june  facebook announced its plans to discontinue the use of facebook credits and instead will offer pricing in local currencies 
facebook will continue to retain of the stated price for transactions on their platform under the terms of their new payments program 
we expect to begin our transition away from facebook credits and to adopt facebook s local currency based payments model in the first half of on november   we amended our agreements with facebook such that our use of the facebook platform and any data from facebook on any zynga service offered through a zynga game page for example  the with friends network will be governed by facebook s standard terms of service beginning on march  under the current terms of service  we will be limited in our ability to use a facebook user s friends list and facebook s communication channels to promote the with friends network 
in december  facebook amended its standard terms of service to prohibit i apps on the facebook canvas from promoting or linking to game sites other than facebook and ii the use of emails obtained from facebook to promote or link to desktop web games on platforms other than facebook 
we will be prohibited from cross promoting traffic to games that are offered on platforms other than facebook from our games on facebook 
we will not be permitted to use e mail addresses obtained from facebook to promote desktop web games that are not on the facebook platform  subject to certain limited exceptions 
beginning on march   we will no longer be obligated to display facebook advertising units or utilize facebook s payment services facebook credits and or local currency based payments on any zynga game pages 
we will have the right to process our own payments  and facebook will no longer have the right to receive of the proceeds from payments made on the with friends network 
in addition  as of march   we will no longer be required to use facebook as the exclusive social platform for the zynga properties  or be required to grant certain title exclusivities of zynga games on the facebook platform  subject to certain exceptions 
however  any social game launched after march  by zynga will generally be available through the facebook web site concurrent with  or shortly following  the time such game is made available on another social platform or a zynga property 
the addenda with facebook will each expire in amex hasbro initiatives 
in we entered into two strategic initiatives to create new ways for people to play our games 
in may  we launched a new program with american express to provide co branded prepaid amex cards that will allow customers to receive free virtual currency for signing up for the prepaid card and for their everyday spending 
in february  we announced a global 
table of contents partnership with hasbro that grants them the rights to develop a wide range of toy and gaming experiences based on zynga s social games and brands 
stock repurchase program 
in october  our board authorized a million stock repurchase program 
we initiated purchases under this program in december as of december   we had spent a total of million under our stock repurchase program to repurchase million shares of our class a common stock at an average price of per share  the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under this plan was million 
factors affecting our performance changes in facebook agreements 
facebook is the primary distribution  marketing  promotion and payment platform for our social games 
we generate a significant portion of our bookings  revenue and players through the facebook platform and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
facebook and other platforms generally have the discretion to change their platforms  terms of service and other policies with respect to us or other developers  and those changes may be unfavorable to us 
on november   we amended our agreements with facebook such that our use of the facebook platform and any data from facebook on any zynga service offered through a zynga game page for example  the with friends network will be governed by facebook s standard terms of service beginning on march  under the current terms of service  we will be limited in our ability to use a facebook user s friends list and facebook s communication channels to promote the with friends network 
in december  facebook amended its standard terms of service to prohibit i apps on the facebook canvas from promoting or linking to game sites other than facebook and ii the use of emails obtained from facebook to promote or link to desktop web games on platforms other than facebook 
we will be prohibited from cross promoting traffic to games that are offered on platforms other than facebook from our games on facebook 
we will not be permitted to use e mail addresses obtained from facebook to promote desktop web games that are not on the facebook platform  subject to certain limited exceptions 
beginning on march   we will no longer be obligated to display facebook advertising units or utilize facebook s payment services facebook credits and or local currency based payments on any such zynga game pages 
we will have the right to process our own payments  and facebook will no longer have the right to receive of the proceeds from payments made on the with friends network 
launch of new games and release of enhancements 
our bookings and revenue results have been driven by the launch of new games and the release of fresh content and new features in existing games 
although the amount of revenue and bookings we generate from a new game or an enhancement to an existing game can vary significantly  we expect our revenue and bookings to be correlated to the success and timely launch of our new games and our success in releasing engaging content and features 
game monetization 
we generate most of our bookings and revenue from the sale of virtual goods in our games 
the degree to which our players choose to pay for virtual goods in our games is driven by our ability to create content and virtual goods that enhance the game play experience 
our bookings  revenue and overall financial performance are affected by the number of players and the effectiveness of our monetization of players through the sale of virtual goods and advertising 
for example abpu decreased from in the twelve months ended december  to in the twelve months ended december   which was partially due to a shift in our user base to mobile games including draw something  a mobile game that increased our overall player base  but did not monetize as high as some of our core web games 
in addition  mobile and international players have historically monetized at a lower level than us players on average 
the percentage of paying mobile and international players may increase or decrease based on a number of factors  including growth in mobile games as a percentage of total game audience and our overall international players  localization of content and the availability of payment options 
investment in game development 
in order to develop new games and enhance the content and features in our existing games  we must invest in a significant amount of engineering and creative resources 
these 
table of contents expenditures generally occur months in advance of the launch of a new game or the release of new content  and the resulting revenue may not equal or exceed our development costs 
player acquisition costs 
we utilize advertising and other forms of player acquisition and retention to grow and retain our player audience 
these expenditures generally relate to the promotion of new game launches and ongoing performance based programs to drive new player acquisition and lapsed player reactivation 
over time  these acquisition and retention related programs may become either less effective or more costly  negatively impacting our operating results 
due to the amendment of our agreement with facebook  effective march   we may incur increased player acquisition costs as our ability to cross promote traffic to games that are offered on platforms other than facebook  for example  games offered on our with friends network  as well as our rmg offerings with bwin 
party  will be limited by facebook s standard terms of service  subject to certain exceptions 
new market development 
we are investing in new distribution channels such as the with friends network  mobile platforms  other social networks and international markets to expand our reach and grow our business 
for example  we have continued to hire additional employees and acquire companies with experience developing mobile applications 
we have also invested resources in integrating and operating some of our games on additional platforms  including google  mixi  tencent  and our with friends network 
our ability to be successful will depend on our ability to obtain users on our with friends network  interest third party game developers  attract advertisers and successfully extend our with friends network to mobile 
during  we expanded our efforts into rmg markets by entering into an agreement with bwin 
party to offer rmg products in the uk and filing an application for preliminary finding of suitability with the nevada gaming control board 
we will continue to explore rmg options in regulated markets as well as take actions in preparation for potential legislative developments 
as we expand into new markets and distribution channels  we expect to incur headcount  marketing and other operating costs in advance of the associated bookings and revenue 
our financial performance will be impacted by our investment in these initiatives and their success 
stock based expense 
prior to our initial public offering  we granted zsus to our employees that generally vested upon the satisfaction of both a service period condition of up to four years and a liquidity event condition  the latter of which was satisfied upon our initial public offering 
because the liquidity event condition was not met until our initial public offering  prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not recorded any expense related to our zsus 
in the twelve months ended december   we recognized million  of stock based expense related to zsus 
hiring and retaining key personnel 
our ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees 
during  we experienced increased employee attrition 
retaining key employees is critical to our ability to grow our business and execute on our business strategy 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of web hosting and data center costs related to operating our games  including depreciation and amortization  consulting costs primarily related to third party provisioning of customer support services  certain payment processing fees  and salaries  benefits and stock based expense for our customer support and infrastructure teams 
our infrastructure team includes our network operations and payment platform teams 
credit card processing fees  allocated facilities costs and other supporting overhead costs are also included in cost of revenue 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based expense for our engineers and developers 
in addition  research and development expenses include outside services and consulting  as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs 
we 
table of contents believe continued investment in enhancing existing games and developing new games  and in software development tools and code modification  is important to attaining our strategic objectives 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of player acquisition costs  which are advertisements designed to drive players into our games  salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for our sales and marketing employees and fees paid to consultants 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses include general marketing  branding  advertising and public relations costs  as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our player base and continue building brand awareness 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based expense for our executive  finance  legal  information technology  human resources and other administrative employees 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include outside consulting  legal and accounting services  charitable donations and facilities and other supporting overhead costs not allocated to other departments 
general and administrative expenses also include gains and losses associated with legal settlements

the increases in online game revenue from castleville  hidden chronicles and farmville were the result of these games more recent launch dates in november  february  and september  respectively 
the increase in online game revenue from zynga poker was mainly due to bookings growth on mobile platforms 
the growth in online game revenue was partially offset by decreases in online game revenue of million and million from mafia wars and frontierville  respectively which was primarily due to an overall decrease in bookings driven by a shift in players to newer games

online game revenue increased million in farmville  frontierville and cityville accounted for million  million and million of the increase  respectively 
farmville was launched in june  and the increase in revenue reflects an increase in bookings from new content  as well as the recognition of revenue derived from deferred revenue built up over a longer period of time 
the increase in revenue from frontierville and cityville was the result of the launch of these games in june and december  respectively  and  with respect to frontierville  a change in the estimated weighted average life used to recognize revenue from durable virtual goods  which resulted in a million increase in revenue from frontierville in all other games accounted for the remaining net increase of million

advertising revenue increased million in  due to a million increase in revenue from in game offers  sponsorships and engagement ads  and a million increase in revenue from other advertising activity 
revenue from in game offers  sponsorships and engagement ads increased in part due to a higher level of in game offers during  reflecting in part the fact that we discontinued certain in game offers in the fourth quarter of and resumed and gradually increased in game offers during the year ended december  but did not have in game offers for the entire year 
cost of revenue year ended december  to change to change in thousands cost of revenue compared to cost of revenue increased million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of the prior year

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have identified below our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe require the greatest amount of judgment 
these estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition income taxes business combinations stock based expense goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment of long lived assets revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods and from the sale of advertising within our games 
online game we operate our games as live services that allow players to play for free 
within these games  players can purchase virtual currency to obtain virtual goods to enhance their game playing experience 
players can primarily pay for our virtual currency using facebook credits when playing our games through the facebook platform  and can use other payment methods such as credit cards or paypal on other platforms 
we also sell game cards that are initially recorded as a customer deposit liability which is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  net of fees retained by retailers and distributors 
upon redemption of a game card into one of our games and delivery of virtual currency to the player  these amounts are reclassified to deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the player  the collection of our fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
for purposes of determining when the service has been provided to the player  we have determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying player to continue displaying the purchased virtual goods within the online game over their estimated life or until they are consumed 
the proceeds from the sales of virtual goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue 
we categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable 
consumable virtual goods  such as energy in cityville  represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action 
common characteristics of consumable goods may include virtual goods that are no longer displayed on the player s game board after a short period of time  do not provide the player any continuing benefit following consumption or often times enable a player to perform an in game action immediately 
for the sale of consumable virtual goods  we recognize revenue as the goods are consumed 
durable virtual goods  such as tractors in farmville  represent virtual goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time 
we recognize revenue from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the estimated average playing period of paying players for the applicable game  which represents our best estimate of the average life of our durable virtual goods 
if we do not have the ability to differentiate revenue attributable to durable virtual goods from consumable virtual goods for a specific game  we recognize revenue from the sale of durable and consumable virtual goods for that game ratably 
table of contents over the estimated average period that paying players typically play our games as further discussed below 
future paying player usage patterns and behavior may differ from the historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated average playing periods may change in the future 
prior to october   we did not have the data to determine the consumption dates for our consumable virtual goods or to differentiate revenue attributable to durable virtual goods from consumable virtual goods 
beginning in october  we had sufficient data to separately account for consumable and durable virtual goods in one of our games  thus allowing us to recognize revenue related to consumable goods upon consumption 
since january  we have had this data for substantially all of our web games  thus allowing us to recognize revenue related to consumable goods upon consumption for our web based games 
we expect that in future periods there will be changes in the mix of durable and consumable virtual goods sold  reduced virtual good sales in some existing games  changes in estimates in average paying payer life and or changes in our ability to make such estimates 
when such changes occur  and in particular if more of our revenue in any period is derived from goods for which revenue is recognized over the estimated average playing period  or that period increases on average  the amount of revenue that we recognize in a future period may be reduced  perhaps significantly 
on a quarterly basis  we determine the estimated average playing period for paying players by game beginning at the time of a payer s first purchase in that game and ending on a date when that paying player is no longer playing the game 
to determine when paying players are no longer playing a given game  we analyze monthly cohorts of paying players for that game who made their first in game payment between six and months prior to the beginning of each quarter and determine whether each player within the cohort is an active or inactive player as of the date of our analysis 
to determine which players are inactive  we analyze the dates that each paying player last logged into that game 
we determine a paying player to be inactive once they have reached a period of inactivity for which it is probable defined as at least that a player will not return to a specific game 
for the payers deemed inactive as of our analysis date we analyze the dates they last logged into that game to determine the rate at which inactive players stopped playing 
based on these dates we then project a date at which all paying players for each monthly cohort are expected to cease playing our games 
we then average the time periods from first purchase date and the date the last player is expected to cease playing the game for each of the monthly cohorts to determine the total playing period for that game 
to determine the estimated average playing period we then divide this total playing period by two 
the use of this average approach is supported by our observations that paying players typically become inactive at a relatively consistent rate for our games 
if future data indicates paying players do not become inactive at a relatively consistent rate  we will modify our calculations accordingly 
when a new game is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is available for our analysis  then we also consider other factors  such as the estimated average playing period for other recently launched games with similar characteristics  to determine the estimated average playing period 
in may  we entered into an agreement with facebook to accept facebook credits as the primary in game payment method for our games played through the facebook platform 
the agreement required us to begin migrating our games to facebook credits in our games beginning in july  and by april this migration was complete 
facebook credits is facebook s proprietary virtual currency that facebook sells for use on the facebook platform 
under the terms of our agreement  facebook sets the price our players pay for facebook credits and collects the cash from the sale of facebook credits 
facebook s current stated face value of a facebook credit is 
for each facebook credit purchased by our players and redeemed in our games  facebook remits to us  which is the amount we recognize as revenue 
we recognize revenue net of the amounts retained by facebook because we do not set the pricing of facebook credits sold to the players of our games 
prior to the implementation of facebook credits in our games  players could purchase our virtual goods through various widely accepted payment methods offered in the games and we recognized revenue based on the transaction price paid by the player 
we estimate chargebacks from facebook and our third party payment processors to account for potential future chargebacks based on historical data and record such amounts as a reduction of revenue 

table of contents advertising we have contractual relationships with agencies  brokers and certain advertisers for advertisements within our games 
we recognize advertising revenue as advertisements are delivered to customers as long as evidence of the arrangement exists executed contract  the price is fixed and determinable  and we have assessed collectability as reasonably assured 
certain branded virtual goods and sponsorships are deferred and recognized over the estimated average life of the branded virtual good or as the branded virtual good is consumed  similar to online game revenue 
we generally report our advertising revenue net of amounts due to advertising agencies and brokers because we are not the primary obligor in our arrangements  we do not set the pricing  and we do not establish or maintain the relationship with the advertiser 
certain advertising arrangements that are directly between us and end advertisers are recognized gross equal to the price paid to us by the end advertiser since we are the primary obligor and we determine the price 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
if necessary  the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence 
we account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes 
business combinations in line with our growth strategy  we have completed acquisitions to expand our social games and mobile offerings  obtain employee talent  and expand into new markets 
we account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of the acquisition to the tangible assets  liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of such items requires judgment  including estimating future cash flows or estimating the cost to recreate an acquired asset 
if actual results are lower than estimates  we could be required to record impairment charges in the future 
acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances exist which indicate an impairment may exist 
acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 
during the one year period beginning with the acquisition date  we may record certain purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed against goodwill 
after the final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
subsequent to the measurement period  our final determination of any acquired tax attributes value will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based expense prior to our initial public offering in december  we granted zsus to our employees that generally vest upon the satisfaction of both a service based condition of up to four years and a liquidity condition  the latter of which was satisfied in connection with our initial public offering in december because the liquidity 
table of contents condition was not satisfied until our initial public offering  in prior periods  we had not recorded any expense relating to the granting of our zsus 
in the fourth quarter of  after the initial public offering  we recognized million of stock based expense associated with zsus that vested in connection with our initial public offering 
this expense is in addition to the stock based expense we recognize related to outstanding equity awards other than zsus as well as expenses related to zsus or other equity awards that may be granted in the future 
for zsus granted prior to the initial public offering  we recognize stock based expense using the accelerated attribution method  net of estimated forfeitures  in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche 
for zsus granted after the initial public offering  which are only subject to a service condition  we recognize stock based expense on a ratable basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires the use of the following assumptions i expected volatility of our class a common stock  which is based on our peer group in the industry in which we do business  ii expected life of the option award  which we elected to calculate using the simplified method  iii expected dividend yield  which is  as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock  and iv the risk free interest rate  which is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with maturities equal to the grant s expected life 
option grants generally vest over four years  with vesting after one year and the remainder vesting monthly thereafter over months 
the options have a contractual term of years 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model changes significantly  stock based expense for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously 
the following table summarizes the assumptions relating to our stock options granted in  and year ended december  expected term  in years risk free interest rates expected volatility dividend yield fair value of common stock stock based expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures so that expense is recorded for only those stock based awards that we expect to vest 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical forfeiture of equity awards adjusted to reflect future changes in facts and circumstances  if any 
we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates 
we record stock based expense for stock options on a straight line basis over the vesting term 
for stock options issued to non employees  including consultants  we record expense equal to the fair value of the options goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are carried at cost and are evaluated annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances exist that indicate that impairment may exist 
when conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment  we perform a quantitative evaluation of whether goodwill is impaired using the two step impairment test 
the first step is comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
we consider our consolidated entity to be our single reporting unit for this analysis 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
we record the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  as impairment 

table of contents for our annual impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  our estimates of fair value were based on the market approach  which estimated the fair value of our reporting unit based on the company s market capitalization and an assumed control premium 
the result of the impairment analysis showed that the estimated fair value of the company exceeded its carrying value 
we further corroborated the analysis by estimating the fair value using the income approach which was based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows 
the results of our analysis using the income approach were consistent with those noted above using the market approach 
accordingly  we concluded goodwill was not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including other intangible assets excluding indefinite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of the long lived assets by comparing the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related assets 
if the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are considered impaired and an expense  equal to the amount required to reduce the carrying value of the assets to the estimated fair value  is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
for example  if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a continued decline in our market capitalization  we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and or acquired intangible assets 
impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate fluctuation risk our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash  money market funds  us government debt securities and corporate debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  ensure liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
our available for sale investments consist of us government and corporate debt securities which may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates that may cause the fair values of our investments to fluctuate 
based on a sensitivity analysis  we have determined that a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately million as of december  such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
foreign currency exchange risk our sales transactions are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk 
however  certain of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  chinese yuan  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and indian rupee 
the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy 
although we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of transaction gains losses related to revaluing certain cash balances  trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable  current liabilities and intercompany balances that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
