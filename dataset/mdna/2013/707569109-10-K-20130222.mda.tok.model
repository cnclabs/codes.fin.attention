item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operations we are a leading  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari mutuel properties 
as of december   we owned  managed  or had ownership interests in twenty nine facilities in the following nineteen jurisdictions colorado  florida  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  louisiana  maine  maryland  mississippi  missouri  nevada  new jersey  new mexico  ohio  pennsylvania  texas  west virginia  and ontario 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
in  we began our transition from a pari mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the charles town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in west virginia 
since  we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions including the acquisitions of hollywood casino bay st 
louis and boomtown biloxi  crc holdings  inc  hollywood casino corporation  argosy gaming company  zia park casino  sanford orlando kennel club and the m resort  greenfield projects such as hollywood casino at penn national race course  hollywood casino bangor and hollywood casino perryville  and property expansions such as hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino lawrenceburg 
most recently  we  along with our joint venture partner  opened hollywood casino at kansas speedway on february  and in ohio  we opened our hollywood casino toledo facility on may  and our hollywood casino columbus facility on october  finally  on november   we acquired harrah st 
louis facility  which we are in the process of rebranding to hollywood casino st 
louis 
the vast majority of our revenue is gaming revenue  derived primarily from gaming on slot machines which represented approximately and of our gaming revenue in and  respectively and to a lesser extent  table games  which is highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties 
other revenues are derived from our management service fee from casino rama  our hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities  and our racing operations 
our racing revenue includes our share of pari mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers  our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting  and our share of wagering from our otws 
key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle and table game drop volume indicators and win or hold percentage 
our typical property slot hold percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered for the period cited 
the win or hold percentage is the net amount of gaming wins and losses  with liabilities recognized for accruals related to the anticipated payout of progressive jackpots 
our slot hold percentages have consistently been in the to range over the past several years 
given the stability in our slot hold percentages  we have not experienced significant impacts to earnings from changes in these percentages 
for table games  customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables 
the cash and markers extensions of credit granted to certain credit worthy customers are deposited in the gaming table drop box 
table game win is the amount of drop that is retained and recorded as casino gaming revenue  with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for unredeemed gaming chips 
as we are focused on regional gaming markets  our table win percentages are fairly stable as the majority of these markets do not regularly experience high end play which can lead to volatility in win percentages 
therefore  changes in table game win percentages do not typically 
table of contents have a material impact to our earnings 
however  as discussed in our analysis of gaming revenues in a later section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the introduction of table games in july at hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino at penn national race course and in march at hollywood casino bangor has led to an increase in our gaming revenues and earnings in our east west segment 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow  since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines  table games  and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive  and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund capital maintenance expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions 
we continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties  the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and the development of new gaming properties  particularly in attractive regional markets 
current capital projects are ongoing at several of our properties 
additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures below 
proposed spin off of real estate assets through a real estate investment trust on november   we announced that we intend to pursue a plan to separate the majority of our gaming operating assets and real property assets into two publicly traded companies  including an operating entity  png  and  through a tax free spin off of our real estate assets to holders of our common stock  a newly formed publicly traded reit  propco  subject to required gaming regulatory body approvals 
as a result of the proposed spin off  propco will initially own substantially all of the real property assets and will lease back most of those assets to png for use by its subsidiaries  under a triple net year master lease agreement including extensions 
png would own the gaming licenses  operate the leased gaming facilities and own and operate other assets  including the casino rama casino management contract  the joint venture interest in hollywood casino at kansas speedway  seven non casino racetracks and gaming equipment 
based on the company current real estate portfolio  propco is expected to initially own the real estate for casino facilities  as well as the two new video lottery terminal facilities to be constructed in ohio 
through its rent structure  which is partially based on the performance of the facilities  propco would expect to grow organically by participating in png growing revenue base 
in addition  propco would focus on expanding its gaming and leisure sector real estate portfolio through acquisitions  and thereby diversify its asset base and tenant base over time 
propco will also own and operate hollywood casino perryville and hollywood casino baton rouge through its taxable reit subsidiaries 
after the proposed spin off of propco shares to the company shareholders  propco will declare a dividend to its shareholders to distribute any accumulated earnings and profits attributable to any pre reit years to comply with certain reit qualification requirements 
we currently estimate that  if propco were to elect reit status as of january   the aggregate amount of the taxable dividend would be approximately billion 
the dividend will be paid in a combination of cash and propco common stock  which will consist of at least in cash with the remainder in propco common stock 
in addition  going forward  the company expects that propco will distribute at least of its annual taxable income as dividends 
prior to the spin off  the company anticipates refinancing its existing debt obligations and png and propco are expected to enter into new credit facilities 

table of contents the company has received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service relating to the tax treatment of the separation and the qualification of propco as a reit 
the private letter ruling is subject to certain qualifications and based on certain representations and statements made by the company 
if such representations and statements are untrue or incomplete in any material respect including as a result of a material change in the proposed transaction or other relevant facts  the company may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling 
the company expects to receive opinions from outside counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that are not covered by the private letter ruling 
the completion of the proposed transaction is contingent on receipt of regulatory approvals  which the company anticipates could occur in the second half of  the receipt of final approval by the penn national gaming board of directors  the receipt of legal and accounting opinions  and other customary conditions 
the company may  at any time and for any reason until the proposed spin off is complete  abandon the spin off or modify or change the terms of the spin off 
segment information in  we realigned our reporting structure in connection with the hiring of a senior vice president of regional operations 
we now have three senior vice presidents of regional operations who oversee various properties based primarily on their geographic locations and whom report directly to our president and chief operating officer 
this event impacted how our chief executive officer  who is the company codm as that term is defined in asc  measures and assesses our business performance and has caused us to conclude that we now have reportable segments 
therefore  we have aggregated our properties into three reportable segments i midwest  ii east west  and iii southern plains  consistent with how our codm reviews and assesses our financial performance 
the midwest reportable segment consists of the following properties hollywood casino lawrenceburg  hollywood casino aurora  hollywood casino joliet  argosy casino alton  hollywood casino toledo  which opened on may   and hollywood casino columbus  which opened on october  it also includes our casino rama management service contract and the mahoning valley and dayton raceway projects in ohio which we anticipate completing in the east west reportable segment consists of the following properties hollywood casino at charles town races  hollywood casino perryville  hollywood casino bangor  hollywood casino at penn national race course  zia park casino  and the m resort 
the southern plains reportable segment consists of the following properties argosy casino riverside  argosy casino sioux city  hollywood casino baton rouge  hollywood casino tunica  hollywood casino bay st 
louis  boomtown biloxi  hollywood casino st 
louis formerly harrah st 
louis which was acquired from caesars entertainment on november   and includes our investment in kansas entertainment  which owns the hollywood casino at kansas speedway that opened on february  the other category consists of our standalone racing operations  namely beulah park  raceway park  rosecroft raceway  sanford orlando kennel club  and our joint venture interests in sam houston race park  valley race park and freehold raceway 
it also included our joint venture interest in the maryland jockey club which was sold in july if we are successful in obtaining gaming operations at these locations  they would be assigned to one of our regional executives and reported in their respective reportable segment 
the other category also includes our corporate overhead operations which does not meet the definition of an operating segment under asc and our bullwhackers property 
executive summary economic conditions continue to impact the overall domestic gaming industry as well as operating results 
we believe that current economic conditions  including  but not limited to  high unemployment 
table of contents levels  low levels of consumer confidence  increased stock market volatility  and higher taxes  have resulted in reduced levels of discretionary consumer spending compared to historical levels 
we believe our strengths include our relatively low leverage ratios compared to the regional casino companies that we directly compete against and the ability of our operations to generate positive cash flow 
these two factors have allowed us to develop what we believe to be attractive future growth opportunities 
we have also made investments in joint ventures that we believe may allow us to capitalize on additional gaming opportunities in certain states if legislation or referenda are passed that permit and or expand gaming in these jurisdictions and we are selected as a licensee 
financial highlights we reported net revenues and income from operations of  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to  million and million  respectively  for the corresponding period in the prior year 
the major factors affecting our results for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were the full year impact of the june  acquisition of the m resort 
an increase in gaming revenue at hollywood casino at charles town races primarily due to the continued impact from the introduction of table games in july coupled with mild weather in the first quarter of the partial opening of a casino complex at the arundel mills mall in maryland in june and its second phase opening in mid september  which negatively impacted hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino perryville 
an increase in gaming revenue at zia park casino due to strengthening regional economic conditions 
the opening of hollywood casino toledo on may   which generated million of net revenues for the year ended december  the opening of hollywood casino columbus on october   which generated million of net revenues for the year ended december  new competition in our midwest segment  namely a new casino opening in july near hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet  as well as a recent opening on june  of a new racino in columbus  ohio as well as our columbus casino  both of which negatively impacted hollywood casino lawrenceburg 
this impact was partially mitigated by the expiration of the surcharge in july for hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet 
pre tax insurance gain of million at hollywood casino joliet for the year ended december  the acquisition of harrah st 
louis facility  now known as hollywood casino st 
louis  on november   which contributed million of net revenues for the year ended december  the february  opening of our joint venture  hollywood casino at kansas speedway  which negatively impacted the results at our argosy riverside property in our southern plains segment 
the opening of a new casino in biloxi  mississippi in late may  which impacted boomtown biloxi  and the opening of a new riverboat casino and hotel in baton rouge  louisiana on september   which impacted hollywood casino baton rouge 

table of contents a pre tax insurance gain of million at hollywood casino tunica for the year ended december   compared to insurance deductible charges due to a flood at hollywood casino tunica of million for the year ended december  management continued focus on cost management that has resulted in improved operating margins at of our gaming facilities that we operated in both periods  for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
lobbying efforts in maryland related to our opposition to the november gaming referendum for million for the year ended december   which is included in the other segment and is included in general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of operations 
our other category for the year ended december  also included a gain of million on the sale of our interest in the maryland jockey club in july  a million debt extinguishment charge related to debt issuance costs write offs and a call premium payment for the early retirement of our million senior subordinated notes  and a million charge for our share of a goodwill impairment write down at our new jersey joint venture 
net income decreased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  primarily due to the variances explained above  as well as increased depreciation expense and income taxes and a decrease in interest expense 
segment developments the following are recent developments that have had or will have an impact on us by segments midwest hollywood casino columbus  a hollywood themed casino in columbus  ohio  with a million budget  inclusive of million in licensing fees  opened on october  and features  slot machines  table games and poker tables  structured and surface parking  as well as various food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge 
the opening of our columbus casino had and will continue to have an adverse impact on hollywood casino lawrenceburg 
hollywood casino toledo  a hollywood themed casino in toledo  ohio  with a million budget million incurred as of december   inclusive of million in licensing fees  opened on may  and features  slot machines  table games and poker tables  structured and surface parking  as well as food and beverage outlets and an entertainment lounge 
additionally  in june  we preliminarily agreed to pay an additional million over ten years to the state of ohio in return for certain clarifications from the state of ohio with respect to various financial matters and limits on competition within the ten year time period 
in february  we decided to remove approximately slot machines in the near term and add poker tables to better meet market demand for hollywood casino columbus 
in march  we announced that we had entered into a non binding memorandum of understanding mou with the state of ohio that establishes a framework for relocating our existing racetracks in toledo and grove city to dayton and austintown located in the mahoning valley  respectively  where we intend to develop new integrated racing and gaming facilities  budgeted at approximately million and million  inclusive of million in license fees and million in relocation fees  respectively 
pursuant to this arrangement  the ohio lottery commission would retain of video lottery terminal revenues exclusive of the horsemen share 
in addition  the mou restricts any other gaming facility from being located within miles of our columbus and toledo casinos  as well as our relocated racetracks  with certain exceptions 
in june  we announced that we had filed applications with the ohio lottery commission for video lottery sales agent licenses for our ohio racetracks  and 
table of contents with the ohio state racing commission for permission to relocate the racetracks 
the new austintown facility  which will be a thoroughbred track  will be located on acres in austintown centrepointe business park near the intersection of interstate and ohio route the dayton facility  a standardbred track  will be located on acres on the site of an abandoned delphi automotive plant near wagner ford and needmore roads in north dayton 
both of the new racetrack facilities will each feature up to  video lottery terminals  as well as various restaurants  bars and other amenities 
we anticipate completing these new integrated racing and gaming facilities in the opening of our dayton facility may have an adverse impact on our hollywood casino columbus facility 
on october   the ohio roundtable filed a complaint in the court of common pleas in franklin county  ohio against a number of defendants  including the governor  the ohio lottery commission and the ohio casino control commission 
the complaint alleges a variety of substantive and procedural defects relative to the approval and implementation of video lottery terminals as well as several counts dealing with the taxation of standalone casinos 
we  along with the other two casinos in ohio  have filed motions for judgment on the pleadings 
in may  the complaint was dismissed  however  the plaintiffs filed an appeal and oral arguments were held on january  on june   a new racino at scioto downs in columbus  ohio opened  which has had a negative impact on hollywood casino lawrenceburg financial results and competes in the same market as hollywood casino columbus 
in addition  a proposed casino in cincinnati  ohio is anticipated to open in march this new facility will have a significant adverse impact on hollywood casino lawrenceburg 
additionally  new racinos in ohio are planned at lebanon raceway  which will start construction soon  and river downs  which has started construction  both of which hope to finish in early we anticipate the opening of these new racinos will have a further adverse impact on hollywood casino lawrenceburg 
in july  we entered into a new interim agreement with the olgc for the operation of the casino rama facility through march   which was subsequently extended in january for an additional six months through september  and extended in august on a month to month basis going forward with a days notice period 
in march  the olgc canceled its process of evaluating bids for a new five year operating contract for the facility which included a limit on operating fees exceeding million per year 
although that particular bid process has been canceled  there are periodic olgc statements about exploring other bids and privatization plans 
as a result  there can be no assurance how long the olgc will continue to engage us to manage the property 
on july   the tenth licensed casino in illinois opened in the city of des plaines 
this facility was a new source of competition for hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet and had a negative impact on these properties financial results 
however  the surcharge hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet paid to subsidize local horse racing interests is no longer required with the opening of the des plaines facility 
east west in our east west segment  hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino perryville faced increased competition and their results have been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the opening of a casino complex at the arundel mills mall in anne arundel  maryland 
the casino opened on june  with approximately  slot machines and significantly increased its slot machine offerings by mid september to approximately  slot machines 
we anticipate the anne arundel facility will add table games in spring of which will further negatively impact our hollywood casino at charles town races facility 

table of contents in november  voters approved legislation authorizing a sixth casino in prince george county and the ability to add table games to maryland five existing and planned casinos 
the new law also changes the tax rate casino operators pay the state  varying from casino to casino  allows all casinos in maryland to be open hours per day for the entire year  and permits casinos to directly purchase slot machines in exchange for gaming tax reductions 
for our hollywood casino perryville facility  the tax rate would decrease from percent to percent with an option for an additional percent reduction if an independent commission agrees  and table games would be expected to be implemented at perryville in spring of a separate state commission is expected to take bids for the prince george casino in may though we intend to participate in the bidding process  we believe another operator could be selected  and as a result our financial results would be adversely impacted as it would create additional competition for hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino perryville 
hollywood casino bangor introduced table games on march  with the addition of six blackjack tables  a roulette table and seven poker tables 
however  on june   a new casino opened in oxford  maine  approximately miles from our facility  which has and will continue to have a negative impact on hollywood casino bangor 
southern plains on november   we closed on the agreement to acquire of the equity of harrah st 
louis gaming and lodging facility from caesars entertainment for a purchase price of million 
while the acquisition was a stock transaction  it was treated as an asset transaction for tax purposes 
this enables us to amortize the goodwill and other fair value adjustments for tax purposes 
the acquisition reflects the continuing efforts of the company to expand its regional operating platform with a facility in a large metropolitan market 
we are currently in the process of transitioning the property to our hollywood casino brand name 
the purchase price of the transaction was funded through an add on to our senior secured credit facility 
the st 
louis facility is located adjacent to the missouri river in maryland heights  missouri  directly off i and approximately miles northwest of downtown st 
louis 
the facility is situated on acres along the missouri river and features approximately  square feet of gaming space with  slot machines  table games  poker tables  a guestroom hotel  nine dining and entertainment venues and structured and surface parking 
kansas entertainment opened its hollywood themed facility on february  the facility features a  square foot casino with approximately  slot machines  table games and poker tables  a  space parking structure  as well as a variety of dining and entertainment facilities 
we and international speedway corporation shared equally in the cost of developing and constructing hollywood casino at kansas speedway 
the opening of this casino has and will continue to negatively impact the financial results of our argosy riverside property due to their close proximity to one another 
on may   hollywood casino tunica was forced to close as a result of flooding by the mississippi river 
due to the flooding  access to the property was temporarily cut off and the property sustained minor damage 
the property reopened on may  at the time of the flood  we carried property insurance coverage with a flood limit of million for both property damage and business interruption applicable to this event 
this coverage included a million property damage and two day business interruption deductible for the peril of flood 
we received million in insurance proceeds related to the flood at hollywood casino tunica  with million received during the year ended december  as the insurance recovery amount exceeded the net book value of assets believed to be damaged and other costs incurred as a result of the flood  we recorded a pre tax gain of million during the year ended december  during the second quarter of  the insurance claim for the flood at hollywood casino tunica was settled and as such no further proceeds will be received 

table of contents gaming licenses in iowa are typically issued jointly to a gaming operator and a local charitable organization known as a qso 
the agreement between the company gaming operator subsidiary in iowa  the belle  and its qso  mrhd  expired in early july on july   when presented with an extension of the company qso operating agreement for the sioux city facility through march  the irgc failed to approve the extension and urged a shorter extension 
in mid august  mrhd offered a revised contract to the company that would require a yearly renewal from the irgc and stated that mhrd would be able to continue searching for an operator for a new land based casino 
the company rejected this contract offer and at the august  irgc meeting urged the irgc to reconsider the original extension offer through march the irgc did not act on this request and  concluded that the casino can continue to operate without an effective operating agreement until such time as a hearing is set by the irgc to decide if the gaming licenses should not be continued 
no such hearing has been scheduled at this time 
the irgc also announced at the july  meeting the schedule for requests for proposals for a new land based woodbury county casino 
applications and financing proposals were due by november  and the irgc is expected to award that license to a gaming operator and a qso by april  the belle has filed three lawsuits against the irgc recent actions  namely refusing to consider the belle request to replace mrhd with another non profit partner and opening up the gaming license to bidding for a land based casino  its failure to approve the extension agreement and any extension  and announcing a process would be instituted to revoke the belle license 
in addition  the belle filed suit against mrhd for a breach of contract and seeking to enjoin mrhd from disavowing the extension agreement it signed and the exclusivity obligations in the agreement 
the injunction request was denied on october  mrhd submitted a proposal with another gaming operator to develop a land based facility in sioux city 
without prejudice to its legal claims  the belle is participating in this request for proposals 
on november   we announced that we had submitted to the irgc two proposals for a new gaming and entertainment destination in woodbury county for the irgc consideration 
the first proposal  hollywood casino sioux city  would feature a  square foot casino floor with slot machines  table games and a table poker room  as well as various dining and entertainment amenities and a multi purpose event center 
the second proposal  hollywood casino siouxland  is similar in size and scope to the hollywood casino sioux city downtown project  but would lie south of sioux city and would include a room hotel as part of the phase one construction 
argosy casino sioux city had remaining goodwill and other intangible assets of million at december  additionally  this facility had net revenues and income from operations of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   which represented and of the company consolidated results 
although we believe one of our two proposals has a strong chance of being selected by the irgc  any disruptions to argosy casino sioux city operations related to the items described above or the selection of another gaming operator to develop and operate the land based casino license would result in non cash impairment charges in future periods as well as the loss of future earnings associated from this property 
a new riverboat casino and hotel in baton rouge  louisiana opened on september  the opening of this riverboat casino has and will continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of hollywood casino baton rouge 
in addition  a casino in biloxi opened in late may  which has and will continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of our boomtown biloxi property 
other in maryland  we actively opposed the november referendum for expanded gaming as we believed it was a flawed process for a potential sixth casino license in prince george county

see discussion on maryland in east west section 
for the year ended december   we spent million in lobbying which is included in general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting estimates we make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change 
we have identified the accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and litigation  claims and assessments as critical accounting estimates  as they are the most important to our financial statement presentation and require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and the related disclosures  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million within our consolidated balance sheet  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets within our consolidated balance sheet  representing and of total assets  respectively  resulting from our acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and racing permits 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 

table of contents in connection with our acquisitions  valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions  projections for future operations  and data obtained from third party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate 
goodwill is tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value in step of the impairment test  then step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit 
if the implied value of goodwill is less than the goodwill allocated for that reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company considers its gaming licenses  racing permits and the majority of its trademark intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities indefinitely not withstanding the recent events in iowa which we concluded was an isolated incident and the first time in our history a gaming regulator has taken an action which could cause us to lose our gaming license as well as our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming and racing commissions 
rather  these intangible assets are tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amounts of the indefinite life intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
we use a market approach model  which includes the use of forecasted adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  charges for stock compensation  depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on disposal of assets  and certain other income and expenses  and inclusive of gain or loss from unconsolidated affiliates and adjusted ebitda multiples  as we believe that adjusted ebitda is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry and as we use adjusted ebitda as the primary measurement of the operating performance of our properties including the evaluation of operating personnel 
in addition  we believe that an adjusted ebitda multiple is the principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies 
changes in the estimated adjusted ebitda multiples or forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
forecasted adjusted ebitda levels based on our annual operating plan as determined in the fourth quarter can be significantly impacted by the local economy in which our reporting units operate 
for example  increases in unemployment rates can result in decreased customer visitations and or lower customer spend per visit 
in addition  the impact of new legislation which approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions or further expands gaming in jurisdictions where our reporting units currently operate can result in opportunities for us to expand its operations 
however  it also has the impact of increasing competition for our established properties which generally will have a negative effect on those locations profitability once competitors become established as a certain level of cannibalization occurs absent an overall increase in customer visitations 
lastly  increases in gaming taxes approved by state regulatory bodies can negatively impact forecasted adjusted ebitda 
the adjusted ebitda multiple utilized by us in our goodwill impairment valuation methodology is determined based on our current enterprise value  increased for a control premium 
the control premium assumption is based on acquisitions of precedent transactions of comparable businesses 
in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach  management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units  including recent operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and other market data 
these considerations can lead the company to modify its individual reporting units adjusted ebitda multiple 
ebitda multiples can be significantly impacted by various factors  such as a company present and future cost of capital  the future growth opportunities for the industry as well as 
table of contents for the company reporting units  general market sentiment  investors perceptions of senior management effectiveness at deploying capital and managing overall operations  as well as pending or recently completed merger transactions 
assumptions and estimates about future adjusted ebitda levels and multiples by individual reporting units are complex and subjective 
they are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors  such as industry  geopolitical and economic trends  and internal factors  such as changes in our business strategy  which may reallocate capital and resources to different or new opportunities which management believes will enhance our overall value but may be to the detriment of an individual reporting unit 
as of the company most recent impairment analysis test performed on october   we applied an estimated adjusted ebitda multiple ranging between and to the individual reporting unit forecasted adjusted ebitda 
for  four reporting units had a fair value in excess of its carrying value by to 
all of our other reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets had fair values that were significantly in excess of their carrying value 
however  we do not believe that the margin by which our reporting units fair value exceeds their carrying value is the only predictor of the likelihood of future impairment charges or the potential magnitude of such charges 
this is because the revenue and earning streams in our industry can vary significantly based on various circumstances  which in many cases are outside of the company control  and as such are extremely difficult to predict and quantify 
we have disclosed several of these circumstances in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
for instance  changes in legislation that approves gaming in nearby jurisdictions which was the primarily reason for our impairment charges recorded in and  further expansion of gaming in jurisdictions where we currently operate  new state legislation that requires the implementation of smoking bans at our casinos or any other events outside of our control that make the customer experience less desirable 
as such  we believe at this time all of our reporting units are at risk of goodwill impairment charges in future periods regardless of the margin by which the current fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and that such margin cannot and should not be relied upon to predict which properties are most at risk for future impairment charges 
gaming licenses in iowa are typically issued jointly to a gaming operator and a local charitable organization known as a qso 
the agreement between the company gaming operator subsidiary in iowa  the belle  and its qso  mrhd  expired in early july on july   when presented with an extension of the company qso operating agreement for the sioux city facility through march  the irgc failed to approve the extension and urged a shorter extension 
in mid august  mrhd offered a revised contract to the company that would require a yearly renewal from the irgc and stated that mhrd would be able to continue searching for an operator for a new land based casino 
the company rejected this contract offer and at the august  irgc meeting urged the irgc to reconsider the original extension offer through march the irgc did not act on this request and concluded that the casino can continue to operate without an effective operating agreement until such time as a hearing is set by the irgc to decide if the gaming licenses should not be continued 
no such hearing has been scheduled at this time 
the irgc also announced at the july  meeting the schedule for requests for proposals for a new land based woodbury county casino 
applications and financing proposals were due by november  and the irgc is expected to award that license to a gaming operator and a qso by april  the belle has filed three lawsuits against the irgc recent actions  namely refusing to consider the belle request to replace mrhd with another non profit partner and opening up the gaming license to bidding for a land based casino  its failure to approve the extension agreement and any extension  and announcing a process would be instituted to revoke the belle license 

table of contents in addition  the belle filed suit against mrhd for a breach of contract and seeking to enjoin mrhd from disavowing the extension agreement it signed and the exclusivity obligations in the agreement 
the injunction request was denied on october  mrhd submitted a proposal with another gaming operator to develop a land based facility in sioux city 
without prejudice to its legal claims  the belle is participating in this request for proposals 
on november   we announced that we had submitted to the irgc two proposals for a new gaming and entertainment destination in woodbury county for its consideration 
the first proposal  hollywood casino sioux city  would feature a  square foot casino floor with slot machines  table games and a table poker room  as well as various dining and entertainment amenities and a multi purpose event center 
the second proposal  hollywood casino siouxland  is similar in size and scope to the hollywood casino sioux city downtown project  but would lie south of sioux city and would include a room hotel as part of the phase one construction 
argosy casino sioux city had remaining goodwill and other intangible assets of million at december  additionally  this facility had net revenues and income from operations of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   which represented and of the company consolidated results 
although we believe one of our two proposals has a strong chance of being selected by the irgc  any disruptions to argosy casino sioux city operations related to the items described above or the selection of another gaming operator to develop and operate the land based casino license would result in non cash impairment charges in future periods as well as the loss of future earnings associated from this property 
we estimated the fair value of our argosy casino sioux city reporting unit based on our expectations of winning the land based casino license and the estimated net present value of the future cash flows associated with obtaining this license which is expected to be announced by the irgc in april coupled with our expectation that we will continue to operate the existing riverboat facility through the construction period for the new land based casino 
during the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million and million for hollywood casino aurora and hollywood casino joliet  respectively  due to decreased earning projections at our properties in the chicagoland regional market resulting from an anticipated increase in competition from the scheduled opening of a casino in the second half of in des plaines  illinois  as well as continued challenging market conditions in the chicagoland regional market 
once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that have a definite life are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized

louis hollywood casino lawrenceburg hollywood casino aurora hollywood casino joliet argosy casino riverside zia park casino argosy casino alton argosy casino sioux city hollywood casino baton rouge others total income taxes at december   we had a net deferred tax liability balance of million within our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
asc also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  which is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents results of operations the following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance the fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets 
as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties such as our recent acquisition of harrah st 
louis gaming and lodging facility from caesars entertainment which closed on november   jurisdictional expansions such as the february opening of a casino through a joint venture in kansas  the may opening of hollywood casino toledo  the october opening of hollywood casino columbus  and the opening of video lottery terminal facilities at two racetracks in ohio which are expected to commence operations in  expansions of gaming in existing jurisdictions such as the introduction of table games in july at hollywood casino at charles town races and hollywood casino at penn national race course  and more recently at hollywood casino bangor in march and expansions improvements of existing properties 
the fact that a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for example  in kansas where we opened a casino through a joint venture in february  in ohio where we opened a casino in toledo in may and in columbus in october  and in maryland where we opened hollywood casino perryville on september  and increased competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as the introduction expansion of commercial casinos in kansas  maryland  ohio  and potentially kentucky  an additional casino in illinois which opened on july   a new riverboat casino and hotel in baton rouge  louisiana which opened on september   a new casino in biloxi  mississippi which opened in late may  a new casino that opened in oxford  maine on june   and the introduction of tavern licenses in several states 
the actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways 
for instance  the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and or property taxes  or via an expansion of gaming 
in addition  government bodies may restrict  prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business such as the implementation of smoking bans 
the continued demand for  and our emphasis on  slot wagering entertainment at our properties 
the successful execution of the development and construction activities currently underway at a number of our facilities  as well as the risks associated with the costs  regulatory approval and the timing of these activities 
the risks related to economic conditions and the effect of such conditions on consumer spending for leisure and gaming activities  which may negatively impact our operating results and our ability to continue to access financing at favorable terms

table of contents year ended december  variance percentage variance gaming food  beverage and other management service fee revenues less promotional allowances net revenues in our business  revenue is driven by discretionary consumer spending  which has been impacted by weakened general economic conditions such as  but not limited to  high unemployment levels  low levels of consumer confidence  higher taxes  and increased stock market volatility 
we have no certain mechanism for determining why consumers choose to spend more or less money at our properties from period to period and as such cannot quantify a dollar amount for each factor that impacts our customers spending behaviors 
however  based on our experience  we can generally offer some insight into the factors that we believe were likely to account for such changes 
in instances where we believe one factor may have had a significantly greater impact than the other factors  we have noted that as well 
however  in all instances  such insights are based only on our reasonable judgment and professional experience  and no assurance can be given as to the accuracy of our judgments

table of contents outlook based on our current level of operations and anticipated earnings growth  we believe that cash generated from operations and cash on hand  together with amounts available under our senior secured credit facility  will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future

in addition  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from acquisitions of gaming properties at reasonable valuations  greenfield projects  jurisdictional expansions and property expansion in under penetrated markets 
if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future or undertake any significant property expansions  our cash requirements may increase significantly and we may need to make additional borrowings or complete equity or debt financings to meet these requirements 
our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control
