item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or md a  of this report 
none of our acquisitions or dispositions in the three year period ended december  was material to our financial position or results of operations 
for information concerning our acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
geographic regions and segments our revenue is almost evenly divided between our united states and international operations 
for financial information concerning our domestic and international operations and segment reporting  see our md a and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our clients consistent with our fundamental business strategy  our agencies serve similar clients  in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients  across a variety of geographic regions and locations 
our clients operate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy 
furthermore  in many cases  our agencies or networks serve different brand and or product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks 
for example  in  our largest client was served by more than of our agencies and represented of our revenue 
no other client accounted for more than of our revenue 
our top clients  ranked by revenue  were each served  on average  by more than of our agencies in and collectively represented approximately of our revenue 
our employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements 
the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline is similar 
common to all is the ability to understand a client s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client s target audience 
recognizing the importance of this core competency  we have established tailored training and education programs for our client service professionals around this competency

risk factors global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 
global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance 
in particular  current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services 
in  the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand 
however  the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the euro zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets 
if economic conditions in these markets do not improve  the demand for our services could be further reduced 
if domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions  client revenue levels and other factors and  in response to reductions in our client revenue  if necessary  we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital 
there can be no assurance whether  or to what extent  our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions  reductions in our client revenue  changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 
in a period of severe economic downturn  the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 
in the normal course of business  we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services 
many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets  many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation  then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients creditworthiness and  in many cases  obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance 
further  in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
in addition  our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients 
we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services 
we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client 
however  the agreements entered into  as well as the production costs incurred  are unique to each client 
the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn 
such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
a reduction in client spending or a delay in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital 
global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services  delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital 
consequently  we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms  if at all 
such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
companies periodically review and change their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships 
if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients  our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 
the markets we operate in are highly competitive 
key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs  the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients  particularly large international clients  on a broad geographic basis 
while many of our client relationships are long standing  from time to time clients put their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review 
we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews 
to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients  our revenue may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships  retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 
our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may  in some cases  be limited by clients perceptions of  or policies concerning  conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships 
if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests  our business  results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 
our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  including highly skilled technically proficient personnel  our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected  which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
approximately of our revenue came from our largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial position 
our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason 
it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns  or they could reduce future spending 
a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients  or the loss of several of our largest clients  if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients  would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we rely extensively on information technology systems 
we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions  summarize results and manage our business  including maintaining client marketing and advertising information 
our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions  malicious intrusion and random attack 
likewise  data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 
additionally  we utilize third parties  including cloud providers  to store  transfer or process data 
while we have taken prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems  there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems  or in systems of third parties we use  that could adversely affect our reputation or business 
government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services  which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope  content and manner of presentation of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services  through regulation or other governmental action 
any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices 
such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services 
these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
laws and regulations  related to user privacy  use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets 
these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies as advertising mediums 
these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad  including political instability and foreign exchange controls  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business 
the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions  competition for client assignments and talented staff  new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations 
the risks of doing business abroad  including political instability and foreign exchange controls  do not affect domestic focused firms 
these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position 
for financial information on our operations by geographic region  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 
we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world 
some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include slower payment of invoices  social  political and economic instability and foreign exchange controls 
in addition  commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague  inconsistently administered and frequently changed 
if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business  our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed  which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors  including us 
if that were to occur  we may require additional financing to fund our day to day working capital requirements 
there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
such circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase approximately million of notes  in whole or in part  on specific dates in the future 
on june   million of our convertible notes due july   or the notes  may be put back to us for repurchase and on july   million of our convertible notes due july   or the notes  may be put back to us for repurchase 
if our convertible notes are put back to us  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the repurchases 
we also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our billion credit agreement  or the credit agreement  to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any repurchase 
however  in the event that availability under our credit agreement or our cash flow from operations were to decrease  we may need to seek additional funding 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms  if at all 
downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 
standard and poor s rating service  or s p  rates our long term debt bbb and moody s investors service  or moody  rates our long term debt baa our short term debt ratings are a and p by the respective rating agencies 
our outstanding senior notes  convertible notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade 
however  the interest rates and fees on our credit agreement would increase if our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded 
additionally  our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short term or long term debt credit ratings 
furthermore  the notes and notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at specified ratios if  in the case of the notes  our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by s p  or baa or lower by moody s or in the case of the notes to bbb or lower by s p  and ba or lower by moody s 
these events would not  however  result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 
we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs 
as part of the evaluation  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction 
despite our efforts  we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks 
as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition 
if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
our goodwill may become impaired  which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or us gaap or gaap  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities  which principally represents the specialized know how of the workforce at the acquired businesses 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows 
while we have concluded  for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report  that our goodwill is not impaired  future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired 
any resulting impairment charge  although non cash  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 
generally  our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other requirements to reduce emissions  but  our businesses could be in the future 
however  we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers 
additionally  to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations  we may need to incur additional costs 
at this time  we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a strategic holding company 
we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world 
on a global  pan regional and local basis  our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines advertising  customer relationship management  or crm  public relations and specialty communications 
our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients 
while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines  we organize our services around our clients 
the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources 
this client centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our clients specific marketing requirements 
we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client centric approach  as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients 
in addition  we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 
as a leading global advertising  marketing and corporate communications company  we operate in all major markets around the world 
we have a large and diverse client base 
our largest client accounted for of our revenue and no other client accounted for more than of our revenue 
our top clients accounted for approximately of our revenue 
our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than of our revenue 
although our revenue is generally balanced between the united states and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base  we are not immune to general economic downturns 
in  our revenue increased compared to the increase reflects strong operating performance by many of our agencies  partially offset by the negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates 
increased revenue in the united states and continued growth in the emerging markets of asia and latin america was partially offset by the on going economic weakness in the euro zone 
global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance 
in particular  current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services 
in  the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand 
however  the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the euro zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets 
if economic conditions in these markets do not improve  the demand for our services could be further reduced 
if domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions  client revenue levels and other factors and  in response to reductions in our client revenue  if necessary  we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital 
there can be no assurance whether  or to what extent  our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions  reductions in our client revenue  changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective 
certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry 
these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non traditional marketing channels  as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms 
additionally  in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets  clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers 
we believe these trends have benefited our business in the past and over the medium and long term will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 
in the near term  barring unforeseen events and excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange  as a result of continued strong operating performance by many of our agencies and new business activities we expect our revenue to increase modestly in excess of the weighted average nominal gdp growth in our major markets 
we expect to continue to identify acquisition opportunities that will build on the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms  expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies that are being used by marketers today 
effective february   we acquired a controlling interest in the clemenger group  our affiliate in australia and new zealand increasing our equity ownership to from 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a non cash gain of million in the first quarter of resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to the acquisition date fair value 
this acquisition has and will continue to help us to further develop our combined businesses throughout the asia pacific region and further enhance our global capabilities 
we had an objective of improving ebita margins to levels for the full year in connection with this objective  during we reviewed our businesses with a focus on enhancing our strategic position  improving our operations and rebalancing our workforce 
as part of this process  we disposed of certain non core and underperforming businesses and repositioned others 
as a result of these actions  we incurred charges of million in the first quarter of for severance  real estate lease terminations and asset and goodwill write offs related to disposals and other costs 
we continue to perform reviews of our businesses and we will take actions  where appropriate  to reposition underperforming businesses 
we will also continue to pursue operational consolidations to further drive efficiencies in our back office functions 
given our size and breadth  we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators 
the key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses 
we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth  including growth by major geographic region  growth by major marketing discipline  impact from foreign currency fluctuations  growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients 
in recent years  our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations 
revenue in increased compared to  of which was organic growth and was related to acquisitions  net of dispositions 
changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 
across our geographic markets  revenue increased in the united states  in the united kingdom and in our other markets  primarily asia and latin america  while revenue decreased in our euro markets 
the change in revenue in compared to in our four fundamental disciplines was advertising increased  crm increased  public relations increased and specialty communications decreased 
we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs and office and general expenses 
salary and service costs consist of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs 
office and general expenses consist of rent and occupancy costs  technology costs  depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses 
each of our agencies requires professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines 
at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client s brand or product and its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client s target audience 
the facility requirements of our agencies are also similar across geographic regions and disciplines  and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
because we are a service business  we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs in relation to revenue 
salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue 
salary and service costs increased in compared to salary and service costs for reflect million of severance charges associated with our repositioning actions 
the increase in costs resulted from growth in our business  as well as increased use of freelance labor  partially offset by lower compensation costs  including incentive compensation primarily as a result of the repositioning actions taken in and tight controls restricting the frequency of salary increases 
excluding the million of severance charges taken in  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue in would have been flat as compared to office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs 
office and general expenses increased in compared to office and general expenses for includes a reduction of million  which reflects the million non cash remeasurement gain recorded in connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest in the clemenger group and charges of million related to our repositioning actions 
excluding the million net decrease  office and general expenses in would have been flat as compared to operating margins increased to in from in and ebita margins increased to in from in the year over year margin improvement was driven by our revenue growth  as well as lower operating costs resulting from actions taken in to improve our operations  rebalance our workforce and drive efficiencies in our back office functions 
our effective tax rate for decreased to  compared to for in the fourth quarter of  income tax expense was reduced by million  primarily resulting from a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities for unremitted foreign earnings of certain of our operating companies located in the asia pacific region  as well as lower statutory tax rates in other foreign jurisdictions 
in an effort to support our continued expansion and pursue operational efficiencies in the asia pacific region  we completed a legal reorganization in certain countries within the region 
as a result of the reorganization  our unremitted foreign earnings in the affected countries are subject to lower effective tax rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate 
therefore we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower tax rate that these earnings are subject to 
in future periods we expect an ongoing annual reduction in income tax expense of approximately million 
the reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a charge of approximately million resulting from us state and local tax accruals recorded for uncertain tax positions  net of us federal income tax benefit 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined  based on the financial condition and prospects of our equity investee in egypt  that there was an other than temporary decline in its carrying value 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment to fair value 
the impairment charge is included in income loss from equity method investments in our income statement 
net income omnicom group inc in increased million  or  to million from million in the year over year increase in net income omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above 
diluted net income per common share omnicom group inc increased to in  compared to in due to the factors described above  as well as the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding 
this reduction was the result of repurchases of our common stock  net of stock option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
critical accounting policies and new accounting standards critical accounting policies the following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this md a 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our financial statements and the related notes  including note  significant accounting policies  for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below 
estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we use a fair value approach in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our cost method investments to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
acquisitions and goodwill we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions 
in making acquisitions  the valuation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors  including specialized know how  reputation  competitive position  geographic coverage and service offerings of the target businesses  as well as our experience and judgment 
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and  accordingly  the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
in circumstances where control is obtained and less than of an entity is acquired  we record of the goodwill acquired 
acquisition related costs  including advisory  legal  accounting  valuation and other costs  are expensed as incurred 
certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations earn outs 
contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date 
in  we completed acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest 
goodwill from these transactions was million 
in addition  for acquisitions completed prior to january   we made contingent purchase price payments earn outs of million  which were included in goodwill 
contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january  are accrued  in accordance with us gaap  when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 
at december   the amount we could be required to pay for earn outs for acquisitions completed prior to january  is million 
our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and or their service capabilities to better serve our clients 
additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know how of the acquisition targets 
accordingly  as is typical in most service businesses  a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the know how of the people  which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately 
for each acquisition  we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets 
a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships  including the related customer contracts  as well as trade names 
in valuing these identified intangible assets  we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments  which are our five agency networks 
the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region 
they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions 
we have concluded that for each of our operating segments  their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level 
our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in fasb asc topic  segment reporting  and the guidance set forth in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
consistent with our fundamental business strategy  the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients 
in addition  the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics 
the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and office and general costs  which include rent and occupancy costs  technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software and other overhead expenses 
finally  the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
goodwill impairment review estimates and assumptions we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units the income approach  which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows  comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and when available  consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions 
in applying the income approach  we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows dcf for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin  ebitda  tax rates  capital expenditures  weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long term cash flow growth rates 
all of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses  economic conditions related to the industry we operate in  as well as conditions in the global economy 
the assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are the expected long term growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the range of assumptions used for the long term growth rate and wacc in our evaluations as of june  and were june  long term growth rate wacc long term growth rate represents our estimate of the long term growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global economy we operate in 
the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past ten years was approximately and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was over the same period 
we considered this history when determining the long term growth rates used in our annual impairment test at june  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp 
we also believe  based on our historical performance  that our long term growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth in the markets we operate in 
for our annual test as of june   we used an estimated long term growth rate of for our reporting units 
when performing our annual impairment test as of june  and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units  we considered the current macroeconomic environment  as well as industry and market specific conditions at mid year in the first half of  we experienced an increase in our revenue of  which excludes growth from acquisitions and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the euro zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets 
we considered the effect of these conditions in our annual impairment test 
as a result  we estimated growth rates for the next six years that reflect a reduction from current business results 
the risk adjusted discount rate used in our dcf analysis represents the estimated after tax wacc for each of our reporting units and ranged from to 
the wacc is comprised of a risk free rate of return  a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market  an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units and a current after tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units  each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 
the decrease in the wacc at june  compared to june  was primarily the result of a decrease in the long term us treasury bond  the risk free rate of return used as a component that we use in determining the wacc 
our five reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them 
these differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units 
in addition  these differences as well as differences in book value  including goodwill  cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units 
the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded 
the remaining two agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result  they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 
goodwill impairment review conclusion under us gaap  we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to step of the goodwill impairment test 
although not required  we performed step of the annual impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value  including goodwill 
based on the results of our impairment test  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired at june   because the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective net book value 
the minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail step of the goodwill impairment test was approximately 
notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and long term growth rate are reasonable  we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units 
the results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of june  revealed that if wacc increased by and or long term growth rate decreased by  the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and would pass step of the impairment test 
we will continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment 
the estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations  but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  but they are subject to change from period to period 
actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material 
a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  including its goodwill 
a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a non cash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
subsequent to our annual evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill at june   there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim evaluation for impairment 
at december   given the current economic climate we reviewed the assumptions used in our june  annual impairment test for revenue growth  cash flows  wacc and long term growth rate 
our actual results for revenue growth and cash flows approximated the forecast for revenue growth and cash flows that we used in our impairment test at june  our assumptions for revenue growth and cash flows for approximate our current forecast 
we also reviewed the assumptions used for wacc and long term growth rate 
using data at december   the assumptions are within the change used in our sensitivity analysis at june  based on these factors  we did not perform an interim evaluation for impairment on the carrying value of goodwill at december  additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic  revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis 
revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement  upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured 
prior to recognizing revenue  persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist  the sales price must be fixed or determinable and delivery  performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement 
these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 
because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways  all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 
in the majority of our businesses  we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained when the fee or commission is earned 
although we may bear credit risk with respect to these activities  the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf 
in these cases  costs incurred with third party suppliers are excluded from our revenue 
in certain arrangements  we act as principal and we contract directly with third party suppliers and media providers and production companies and we are responsible for payment 
in these circumstances  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 
some of our client contractual arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals 
we recognize performance incentives in revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved  or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 
additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation share based compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life  rate of risk free interest  volatility and dividend yield 
if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value  our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense was million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements

due to a variety of factors  in the normal course  our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year 
the net result in was an overall gain in new business

net interest expense net interest expense increased to million in  compared to million in interest expense increased million to million 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of million of our senior notes due may   or the notes  in april and million of the notes in august the total outstanding principal amount of the notes is billion

the increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in interest income increased million to million in see liquidity and capital resources and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 
income taxes our effective tax rate for decreased to  compared to for in the fourth quarter of  income tax expense was reduced by million  primarily resulting from a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities for unremitted foreign earnings of certain of our operating companies located in the asia pacific region  as well as lower statutory tax rates in other foreign jurisdictions 
in an effort to support our continued expansion and pursue operational efficiencies in the asia pacific region  we completed a legal reorganization in certain countries within the region 
as a result of the reorganization  our unremitted foreign earnings in the affected countries are subject to lower effective tax rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate 
therefore we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower tax rate that these earnings are subject to 
in future periods we expect an ongoing annual reduction in income tax expense of approximately million 
the reduction in income tax expense was partially offset by a charge of approximately million resulting from us state and local tax accruals recorded for uncertain tax positions  net of us federal income tax benefit

the remeasurement gain resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in clemenger created a difference between the book basis and tax basis of our investment 
because this basis difference is not expected to reverse  no deferred taxes were provided and the tax provision recorded represents the incremental us tax on acquired historical unremitted earnings

liquidity and capital resources cash sources and requirements  including contractual obligations historically  the majority of our non discretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
working capital is our principal non discretionary funding requirement 
in addition  we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes  our recurring business operations  primarily related to lease obligations  as well as contingent purchase price obligations earn outs related to acquisitions made in prior years 
our principal discretionary cash uses include dividend payments  capital expenditures  payments for strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock 
in december  we paid the fourth quarter dividend on our common stock that historically has been paid in january of the following year 
our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
in addition  depending on the level of our discretionary activity and conditions in the capital markets  we may use other available sources of funding such as issuing commercial paper  borrowing under our credit agreement or other long term borrowings to finance these activities 
we expect that we should be able to fund both our non discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending for without incurring additional long term debt 
however  we may access the capital markets at any time if favorable conditions exist 
to take advantage of historically low borrowing rates  in april  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our notes at an issue price of

cash management we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in north america  europe and asia 
the treasury centers are managed by our wholly owned finance subsidiaries 
each day  operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center 
likewise  operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center 
the treasury centers aggregate the net position which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties 
to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity  they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted lines of credit  the credit agreement or issue up to a total of billion of us dollar denominated commercial paper 
this process enables us to manage our debt balances more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively  as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange rate changes 
in countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis  we arrange for local currency uncommitted lines of credit 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million and our short term investments decreased million from december  short term investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash within our current operating cycle  generally one year

the majority of this cash is available to us  net of any taxes payable upon repatriation to the united states 
changes in international tax rules or changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
we have policies governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
in countries where we conduct treasury operations  generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to our credit agreement 
these financial institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings 
we have deposit limits for each of these institutions 
in countries where we do not conduct treasury operations  we ensure that all cash is held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased million from the prior year end  partially reflecting the issuance of billion of our notes

debt instruments and related covenants we have committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
we have a billion committed line of credit  or credit agreement  with a consortium of banks expiring on october  we have the ability to classify borrowings under the credit agreement as long term 
the credit agreement provides support for up to billion of commercial paper issuances  as well as back up liquidity in the event that any of our convertible notes are put back to us 
depending on market conditions at the time  we typically fund our day to day liquidity by issuing commercial paper  borrowing under our uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing under our credit agreement 
at december   there were no outstanding commercial paper issuances or borrowings under the credit agreement 
commercial paper activity for the three years ended december  was dollars in millions average amount outstanding during the year maximum amount outstanding during the year total issuances during the year average days outstanding weighted average interest rate the reduction in commercial paper borrowings in as compared to is a result of the issuance of our notes 
at december   short term borrowings of million represent bank overdrafts and lines of credit of our international subsidiaries 
these bank overdrafts and lines of credit are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the agreements supporting the facilities 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreement 
these financial covenants limit the leverage ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda to no more than times for the most recently ended month period under the credit agreement  ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we are also required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least times for the most recently ended month period 
at december  we were in compliance with these covenants  as our leverage ratio was times and our interest coverage ratio was times 
the credit agreement does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends

however  the interest rates and fees on the credit agreement will increase if our long term debt credit ratings are lowered 
omnicom capital inc  or oci  our wholly owned finance subsidiary  together with us  is a co obligor under our senior notes and convertible notes 
our senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of us and oci and we unconditionally guarantee oci obligations with respect to the senior notes and the convertible notes 
oci provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries 
oci assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable 
there are no restrictions on the ability of oci or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends  loans or advances 
our senior notes and convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
at december   the carrying value of our debt and amounts available under the credit agreement were in millions debt available credit short term borrowings  due in less than one year outstanding commercial paper issuances borrowings under the credit agreement senior notes due april  senior notes due july  senior notes due august  senior notes due may  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt unamortized premium discount on senior notes  net deferred gain from termination of interest rate swaps on senior notes due credit markets and availability of credit we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and actively manage our discretionary expenditures and we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients 
we believe that these actions  in addition to operating cash from and the availability of our credit agreement  are sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our discretionary spending 
in funding our day to day liquidity  we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market 
we expect to continue funding our day to day liquidity through the commercial paper market 
however  prior disruptions in the credit markets led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads 
during these periods of disruption  we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit agreement to mitigate these conditions and to fund our day to day liquidity 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets 
on june   million of our notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on july   million of our notes may be put back to us for repurchase 
if our convertible notes are put back to us  based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase 
although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements  we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any repurchase 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of business 
the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations at december  were in millions obligation due total obligation after long term notes payable principal interest convertible notes lease obligations contingent purchase price obligations defined benefit pension plans postemployment arrangements uncertain tax positions contractual commitments at december  were in millions commitment expires total commitment after standby letters of credit guarantees on june   million of our notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on july   million of our notes may be put back to us for repurchase 
if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date million of convertible notes could be due in at december   we classified our convertible notes as long term in our balance sheet because our credit agreement does not expire until october and it is our intention to fund any repurchase with the credit agreement 
consistent with our acquisition strategy and past practice  certain of our acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments earn outs 
we use contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the post acquisition transition period 
contingent purchase price obligations are recorded as liabilities at the acquisition date fair value 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations 
the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and liability for our postemployment arrangements was million at december  in  we contributed million to our defined benefit pension plans and paid million in benefits for our postemployment arrangements 
we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid 
we have assigned the liability to the periods presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 
in the normal course of business  we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services 
many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets  many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation  then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients creditworthiness and  in many cases  obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance 
further  in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
in addition  our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients 
we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services 
we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client 
however  the agreements entered into  as well as the production costs incurred  are unique to each client 
we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients 
however  the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a global service business  we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes 
we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures  including the use of derivatives 
for foreign currency exposure  derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
for interest rate exposure  derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt 
as a result of using derivative instruments  we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations 
to mitigate the counterparty credit risk  we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors 
we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments 
we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value at risk analysis  or var 
var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
based on the results of the model  we estimate with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value on our derivative financial instruments at december  was not material 
because we use foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
foreign exchange risk our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to us dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations  which are generally denominated in their local currency 
the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
for the most part  revenue and the expenses associated with that revenue are denominated in the same currency 
this minimizes the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations 
while our major non us currency markets are the european monetary union  or the emu  the united kingdom  australia  brazil  canada  china  and japan  our agencies conduct business in more than different currencies 
as an integral part of our treasury operations  we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds 
in certain circumstances  instead of using a multicurrency pool  operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency 
to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions  we use forward foreign exchange contracts 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities 
also  we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency 
in these instances  amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities 
by using these financial instruments  we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 
interest rate risk from time to time  we issue debt in the capital markets 
in prior years we have used interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest cost 
at december   there were no interest rate swaps outstanding 
on june   million of our notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on july   million of our notes may be put back to us for repurchase 
as we have done on prior occasions  we may offer a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to the noteholders to induce them not to put their notes to us 
if we decide to pay a supplemental interest payment  the amount offered would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the put date  including the price of our common stock  short term interest rates and a factor for credit risk 
if our convertible notes are put back to us  based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase 
although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements  we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of operations after the repurchase 
additionally  if the convertible notes are put back to us  our interest expense will change 
the extent  if any  of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that is refinanced  when we refinance  the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing 
even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar for dollar basis  it would have no impact on either our leverage ratio or our debt to capital ratio 
if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest bearing debt at prevailing rates  this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our interest coverage ratio 
however  the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio are currently well within the covenant thresholds 
if either our leverage ratio was to increase or our interest coverage ratio was to halve  we would still be in compliance with these covenants 
therefore  based on our current ratios  our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets  we believe any increase in the interest coverage ratio and reduction in the leverage ratio would still place us comfortably above the covenant requirements 
credit risk we provide advertising  marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business  we grant credit to qualified clients 
due to the diversified nature of our client base  we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for of our revenue and no other client accounted for more than of our revenue 
however  during periods of economic downturn  the credit profiles of our clients could change 
in the normal course of business  we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services 
many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets  many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation  then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client
