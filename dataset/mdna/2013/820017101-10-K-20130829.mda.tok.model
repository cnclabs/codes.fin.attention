the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased billings in the pharmaceutical million  professional million and retail million markets 
these increases in billings were partially offset by decreased billings in the us government contract million  core government million and other million markets 
the increase in the pharmaceutical market billings is due to the timing of customer orders including the launch of three new patient support programs announced in august and october and resupply orders for existing patient support programs 
the programs include the direct fulfillment of the sharps recovery system to the pharmaceutical manufacturers program participants which provides the proper containment  return and treatment of the needles or injection devices utilized in therapy 
the increase in the professional market was a direct result of the company s targeted telemarketing activities  e commerce focused website  trade show participation and internet based promotional activities to educate doctors  dentists and veterinarians on the significant cost advantage and the convenience of the sharps recovery system over the traditional pick up service 
the increase in the retail market is primarily due to sales from a strong flu shot season  orders in advance of the flu shot season  immunizations administered in the retail setting and the initial fill of the complete needle collection disposal system in two major retail pharmacy chains as well as several food and drug chains 
partially offsetting this increase was prior year sales of million related to the initial orders of the company s takeaway environmental return system envelope solution by three large retail pharmacy chains and several food and drug chains to address growing concerns regarding the hazards of unused medications in the home and environment 
us government contract billings are associated with the company s contract with a major us government agency announced in february the decrease in the us government contract market billings is associated with the january  termination of the maintenance portion of a u

the establishment of valuation allowances and development of projected annual effective tax rates requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates 
both positive and negative evidence  as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence  is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce our net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized and is based upon the uncertainty of the realization of certain federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate benefit was relatively flat at for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  the company generated a net loss of million for year ended june  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended june  the higher net loss was primarily due to the million deferred tax valuation allowance discussed above offset by the improved loss before income taxes from fiscal year to discussed above

prospects for the future the company continues to take advantage of the many opportunities in the markets served as professional offices  retail pharmacies and clinics  communities  assisted living and long term care facilities  home healthcare companies  consumers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  government agencies  health care facilities  individual self injectors and commercial organizations become more aware of alternatives to the traditional methods of management of medical sharps waste  used healthcare materials and unused dispensed medications 
the company s growth strategies are focused on the retail  pharmaceutical  professional  assisted living  home health care and core government markets 
the company believes its growth opportunities are supported by an increase in the number of used needles improperly disposed of outside the large healthcare setting and into the solid waste system to billion each year tripled volume over the past ten years and an increase in the number of self injectors in the country to million over the same period  an estimated  doctors  dentists  veterinarians  clinics  tattoo parlors and other businesses in the country that generate smaller quantities of medical waste  including used syringes to whom we offer a lower cost alternative to the traditional pick up service 
the company addresses this market from two directions i field sales which focuses on larger dollar and nation wide opportunities where we can utilize the jma with daniels sharpsmart to integrate the route based pick up service along with our mailback solutions to create a comprehensive medical waste management offering and ii inside and online sales which focus on the individual or small group professional offices  an estimated of the four billion dispensed medication prescriptions which go unused every year in the united states generating an estimated million pounds of unused medication waste  the pace of regulation of sharps and unused dispensed medications disposal which is gaining momentum at both the state and federal level as of june   approximately percent of us citizens live in states that have enacted legislation or strict guidelines mandating the proper disposal of home generated used syringes while percent live in states that have enacted or proposed legislation mandating the proper disposal of home generated dispensed unused medications 
further  since  the federal government  nine states and several counties have introduced legislation requiring manufacturer responsibility for consumer generated unused medications 
state regulatory agencies are also addressing this issue within the regulated industry 
multiple states now require healthcare providers to avoid sewer and trash disposal of non hazardous unused medications within their facilities 
states such as california  washington and minnesota have required assessment and proper treatment by a medical waste disposal company for years 
however  other states such as colorado and florida are now requiring even small healthcare providers to segregate unused medications for proper disposal 
in addition  states are beginning to more closely scrutinize generators returning through reverse distribution unused medications that are actually waste pharmaceuticals and should be disposed of as such  the number of us retail clinics is projected to double between and  expecting business to increase per year  driven by the increasing demand of newly insured patients under healthcare reform as well as patients looking for more convenient care 
the two leading retail pharmacies in the country are emphasizing their efforts to grow their capability as a low cost provider of health care services for non chronic conditions 
the number of pharmacists nationwide trained to deliver vaccines has quadrupled since vaccines offered in retail clinics include season flu programs as well as year round programs for pneumococcus  shingles  pediatric immunizations  hpv and international travel  the changing demographics of the us population one out of five americans will be years or older by  which will increase the need for cost effective medical waste management solutions especially in the home healthcare and assisted living markets  the change in delivery of healthcare more health care being administered in an alternate site as well as uncertainty created by the current state of healthcare facts which are driving more healthcare providers to increase efficiencies and reduce costs  the company s jma with daniels sharpsmart  announced in may  to serve the entire us medical waste market  offering clients a blended product portfolio to effectively target prospective customers with multi site and multi sized locations including those that generate larger quantities of medical waste 
the jma has had a significant positive impact on our pipeline of sales opportunities over of this pipeline is attributable to alliance type opportunities providing comprehensive medical waste management service offerings where both the mailback and pick up service are integrated into the offering  new solution offerings including the complete needle collection and disposal system designed for the traditional under served home self injector  the takeaway line of products for unused medications including takeaway environmental return system  the medical professional takeaway recovery system and enhanced patient support programs with pharmaceutical manufacturers  and the company s strong financial position with a cash balance of million and no debt as of june  terminated contract in february  the company launched sharps mwms  which is a comprehensive medical waste and dispensed medication solution which includes an array of products and services necessary to effectively collect  store and treat medical waste and unused dispensed medication outside of the hospital or large health care facility setting 
in connection with the launch in  the company signed a five year contract one year  plus four option years with a major us government agency for a million program to provide our comprehensive medical waste management system  or sharps mwms  which is a rapid deployment solution offering designed to provide medical waste collection  storage and treatment in the event of natural disasters  pandemics  man made disasters  or other national emergencies 
sharps mwms is unique in that the solution also offers warehousing  inventory management  training  data and other services necessary to provide a comprehensive solution 
we received a purchase order for million million of which was recognized in fiscal year  and million was recognized in the first half of fiscal year 
in january  the company was awarded the first option year ending january  valued at approximately million which was recognized from february  through january  in january  we were awarded the second option year ending january  valued at approximately million and was recognized from february  through january  the company was notified by an agency of the u 
s 
government  acting on behalf of the dsns  that the maintenance contract would not be renewed for the third option year beginning february  and that the contract would be terminated effective january  this non renewal was preceded by a letter dated december  advising the company of the us government s intent to exercise the third option year 
although not stated in the notice provided by the us government  the company believes the action is part of a budget reduction program being implemented by the dsns 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to operating losses generated for the year ended june   the timing of collections from orders related to billings in june  the timing of sales and adjustments of inventory levels to facilitate customer orders and capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets of million discussed below 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease is due to timing of billings and cash collections 
inventory decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in inventory is due to timing of sales and adjustment of inventory levels to facilitate customer orders 
accounts payable increased by million to million at june  from million at june  the increase is a result of the timing of payments 
working capital decreased million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease is primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents and inventory offset by higher accounts receivable and accounts payable discussed above 
property  plant and equipment  net decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in property and equipment is related to depreciation expense of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
the capital expenditures are attributable primarily to i treatment facility improvements of thousand  ii computer and office equipment and custom software programming of thousand and iii manufacturing and assembly equipment including molds  dies and printing plates of thousand 
stockholders equity decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  this decrease is primarily attributable to i a net loss for the year ended june  of million and ii the repurchase of  shares 
the impact was partially offset by the effect on equity credit of non cash stock based award expense of million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company was not a party to any off balance sheet transactions as defined in item of regulation s k for the years ended june  and contractual obligations the company entered into non cancelable operating leases for certain of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if the company decides to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  the company would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
the contractual obligations related to minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases as of june  are as follows in thousands twelve months ending june  total operating lease obligations credit facility effective april   the company executed a credit agreement the restated credit agreement with wells fargo  national association the bank which extends the maturity date of the credit agreement executed on july  prior agreement from july  to july  and reduces the line from million to  due to its lack of need for borrowings 
the company s restated credit agreement with the bank provides for a two year  cash collateralized  line of credit facility  the proceeds of which may be utilized for i working capital  ii capital expenditures and iii letters of credit up to 
as of june   the company had no outstanding borrowings and thousand in letters of credit outstanding 
the company has no borrowings under the restated credit agreement as a result of its strong cash position and lack of need for borrowings 
borrowings bear interest at either i a fluctuating rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin of basis points or ii at the company s option  a fixed rate for a   or day period set at the option date s libor plus a margin of basis points 
any outstanding revolving loans  and accrued and unpaid interest  will be due and payable on july   the maturity date set under the restated credit agreement 
the company pays a fee of per annum on the unused amount of the line of credit 
we estimate that the interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the restated credit agreement would be approximately as of june  the restated credit agreement also contains customary events of default 
upon the occurrence of an event of default that remains uncured after any applicable cure period  the lender s commitment to make further loans may terminate and the company may be required to make immediate repayment of all indebtedness to the lender 
management believes that the company s current cash resources cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations for the twelve months ending june  treatment facility the company s treatment facility in carthage  texas is currently permitted to process tons per day of municipal solid waste 
the incinerator at the facility is currently permitted to treat tons per day of municipal solid waste with of this amount identified as applicable to healthcare facility generated medical waste 
approximately four years ago  the company supplemented the treatment facility s existing incineration process with an autoclave system and technology capable of treating up to seven tons per day of medical waste at the same facility 
autoclaving is a cost effective alternative to traditional incineration that treats medical waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens 
the autoclave system is utilized alongside the incinerator for day to day operations 
the autoclave system is not impacted by the epa amended clean air act discussed below 
we believe that our facility is one of only ten permitted commercial facilities in the united states capable of treating all types of medical waste  used healthcare materials and unused or expired dispensed medications ie  both incineration and autoclave capabilities 
in november and september  the epa and the texas commission on environmental quality promulgated new regulations under the clean air act and associated state statutes which affect the incineration portion of our operation of the treatment facility located in carthage  texas 
these regulations modify the emission limits and monitoring procedures required to operate an incineration facility 
these new regulations and the recent receipt of a title v permit required additional emissions related monitoring equipment and compliance 
such changes required us to incur capital expenditures  which are reflected in cash flows from investing activities in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  in order to meet the requirements of the new regulations 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal year and beyond 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered  and title and risk of loss pass to the customer except for those sales via multiple deliverable arrangements 
provisions for certain rebates  product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded 
product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct  indirect and other market participants  as well as market conditions  including prices charged by competitors 
rebates are estimated based on contractual terms  historical experience  trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with guidance on revenue recognition of multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
under this guidance  certain products offered by the company have revenue producing components that are recognized over multiple delivery points sharps recovery system formerly the sharps disposal by mail systems and various takeaway environmental return systems referred to as mailbacks and sharps pump and asset return boxes  referred to as pump returns and can consist of up to three separate elements  or units of measure  as follows the sale of the compliance and container system  return transportation and treatment service 
in accordance with the relative selling price methodology  an estimated selling price is determined for all deliverables that qualify for separate units of accounting 
the actual consideration received in a multiple deliverable arrangement is then allocated to the units based on their relative sales price 
the selling price for the transportation revenue and the treatment revenue utilizes third party evidence 
the company estimates the selling price of the compliance and container system based on the product and services provided including compliance with local  state and federal laws  adherence to stringent manufacturing and testing requirements  safety to the patient and the community as well as storage and containment capabilities 
revenue for the sale of the compliance and container is recognized upon delivery to the customer  at which time the customer takes title and assumes risk of ownership 
transportation revenue is recognized when the customer returns the compliance and container system and the container has been received at the company s owned or contracted facilities 
the compliance and container system is mailed or delivered by an alternative logistics provider to the company s owned or contracted facilities 
treatment revenue is recognized upon the destruction or conversion and proof of receipt and treatment having been performed on the container 
since the transportation element and the treatment elements are undelivered services at the point of initial sale of the compliance and container  transportation and treatment revenue is deferred until the services are performed 
the current and long term portions of deferred revenues are determined through regression analysis and historical trends 
furthermore  through regression analysis of historical data  the company has determined that a certain percentage of all compliance and container systems sold may not be returned 
accordingly  a portion of the transportation and treatment elements are recognized at the point of sale 
income taxes the liability method is used in accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the establishment of valuation allowances and development of projected annual effective tax rates requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates 
both positive and negative evidence  as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence  is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation under guidance which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under this guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
total stock based compensation expense for the fiscal years ended june   and  was thousand thousand included in cost of revenues and thousand included in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations  thousand thousand included in cost of revenues and thousand included in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations and thousand thousand included in cost of revenues and thousand included in general and administrative expenses in the company consolidated statement of operations  respectively 
the guidance requires any reduction in taxes payable resulting from tax deductions that exceed the recognized tax benefit associated with compensation expense excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows and as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the company included million  million and million of excess tax benefits in its cash flows from financing activities for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
for the year ended june   excess tax benefits were eliminated by the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
recently issued accounting standards there are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that will impact the company s consolidated financial statements
