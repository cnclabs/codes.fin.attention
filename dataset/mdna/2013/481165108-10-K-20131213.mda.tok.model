overview we are a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment for the extraction of coal and other minerals and ores 
we manufacture and market original equipment and aftermarket parts and services for both underground and surface mining and certain industrial applications 
our equipment is used in major mining regions throughout the world to mine coal  copper  iron ore  oil sands  gold and other minerals 
we operate in two business segments underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment 
we are a major manufacturer of underground mining machinery for the extraction of coal and other bedded minerals and offer comprehensive service locations near major mining regions worldwide 
we are also a major producer of surface mining equipment for the extraction of ores and minerals and we provide extensive operational support for many types of equipment used in surface mining 
our principal manufacturing facilities are located in the united states  including facilities in pennsylvania  wisconsin  texas and alabama  and internationally  including facilities in china  the united kingdom  south africa and australia 
acquisition of letourneau 
table of contents on june   we purchased letourneau for approximately billion 
letourneau designs  builds and supports equipment for the mining industry and has been a leader in the earthmoving equipment industry since the s 
letourneau historically operated in three business segments mining equipment  steel products and drilling products 
on october   we completed the sale of letourneau drilling products business to cameron international corporation for million in cash  subject to a post closing working capital adjustment of million that we paid in fiscal we entered into a transition manufacturing and supply agreement to allow for the orderly transfer of drilling products production from longview  texas and a steel supply agreement to allow the buyer time to develop other sources 
in conjunction with our entrance into the transition manufacturing and supply agreement  we recognized an upfront loss and related liability of million for unreimbursable manufacturing costs 
the liability was utilized and adjusted during fiscal and to reflect actual results of performance under the agreement 
the agreement expired in fiscal the results of operations for letourneau are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  with the mining equipment and steel products businesses included in our surface mining equipment segment and the drilling products business reflected as results of discontinued operations 
acquisition of international mining machinery on december   we acquired a controlling interest in imm  a leading designer and manufacturer of underground coal mining equipment in china 
in fiscal  we acquired the remaining shares of imm through a tender offer and subsequent compulsory acquisition of the untendered shares 
prior to obtaining control on december   we accounted for our investment in imm under the equity method 
upon obtaining control  we applied the acquisition method of accounting  re measured the preexisting interest at fair value and recorded a gain of million 
the gain is reported in the consolidated statement of income under the heading other income for the year ended october  the results of operations for imm have been included in the accompanying financial statements from december  forward as part of the underground mining machinery segment 
prior to obtaining control  our share of income from imm was reported in the consolidated statements of income under the heading other income and included in corporate 
operating results net sales for fiscal were billion  compared to billion in fiscal the decrease in net sales in the current year included a million decrease in original equipment sales and a million decrease in aftermarket sales 
the decrease in sales was driven by declining order rates and weak market conditions 
original equipment sales decreased in all regions except africa and south america  which increased by million and million  respectively 
aftermarket sales decreased in all regions except south america  which increased by million 
compared to the prior year  net sales in fiscal included an million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
operating income in fiscal was million or of net sales  compared to billion or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in operating income in the current year is due to lower volumes of million  unfavorable product mix of million  less favorable manufacturing cost absorption of million and a non cash impairment of certain acquired trademarks of million 
these items were partially offset by favorable period costs of million  which includes a million decrease in excess purchase accounting costs and a million decrease in costs from the prior year pension curtailment  and reduced product development  selling and administrative expenses of million  which includes a million decrease in acquisition costs and a million increase in restructuring costs 
in addition  there was a million increase in other income  which includes a successful claim settlement in the fourth quarter of million and a successful acquisition settlement in the fourth quarter of million associated with imm  partially offset by the prior year gain of million on the re measurement of our interest in imm upon obtaining a controlling interest

income from continuing operations attributable to joy global inc was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal bookings for fiscal were approximately billion  compared to billion in fiscal the decrease in bookings in the current year is made up of a million decrease in original equipment bookings and a million decrease in aftermarket bookings 
the decrease in bookings was driven by weak market conditions 
original equipment bookings decreased in all regions except eurasia  which increased by million 
significant original equipment projects greater than million included in orders in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal aftermarket bookings decreased in all regions 
compared to the prior year  bookings in fiscal included a million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation  due primarily to the decline in the value of the australian dollar and south african rand relative to the us dollar

corporate expense for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in corporate expense is primarily due to a decrease in acquisition costs of million  a decrease in restructuring costs of million  a successful claim settlement in the fourth quarter of million and a successful acquisition settlement in the fourth quarter of million associated with imm 
these items were partially offset by the prior year gain of million on the re measurement of our interest in imm upon obtaining a controlling interest 
product development  selling and administrative expense product development  selling and administrative expense for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal product development expense decreased by million  which was driven by reduced headcount and other cost reduction actions  as well as recoveries related to longwall deliveries and development activity 
selling expense decreased by million due to lower pension expense  lower commissions from lower sales volumes  decreased amortization of intangibles and reduced headcount and other cost reduction actions 
administrative expense decreased by million due primarily to lower acquisition costs  lower pension and bad debt expenses  lower performance based compensation and reduced headcount and other cost reduction actions 
these administrative expenses were partially offset by increased restructuring charges 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed our brand portfolio and developed a strategy to increase the visibility of our core brands in furtherance of our one joy global initiative 
during this review  we determined that the indefinite life assumption was no longer appropriate for most of our previously acquired trademarks 
as a result  a non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of which million was recorded by our underground mining machinery segment and million was recorded by our surface mining equipment segment 
this impairment charge is not expected to result in future cash outflows to the company 
net interest expense net interest expense for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to higher borrowings in the prior year and generally lower short term rates

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess inventory  warranty  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  product delivery and transfer of title and risk and rewards has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on long term contracts  such as contracts to manufacture mining shovels  draglines  roof support systems and conveyor systems  using the percentage of completion method 
when using the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recognized in full when identified 
approximately of our sales in fiscal were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service  with the remaining of sales recorded using percentage of completion accounting 
we have life cycle management arrangements with customers to supply parts and service for terms of to years 
these arrangements are established based on the conditions in which the equipment will be operating  the time horizon that the arrangements will cover  and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment 
based on this information  a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified arrangement terms 
accounting for these arrangements requires us to make various estimates  including estimates of the relevant machine s long term maintenance requirements 
under these arrangements  customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment  with the respective deferred revenues recorded when billed 
revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided 
these arrangements are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis  with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs 
if a loss is expected at any time  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we have certain customer agreements that are considered multiple element arrangements 
the agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if those criteria are met  revenue is allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values 
revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
in determining when to recognize revenue  we analyze various factors  including the specifics of the transaction  historical experience  creditworthiness of the customer and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
inventories 
table of contents inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in  first out method for all inventories 
cost includes direct materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
our policy is to evaluate all inventories  including raw material  work in process and finished goods 
inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include engineering drawings  customer relationships  backlog  non compete agreements  patents  unpatented technology and trademarks 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest an impairment in carrying value  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing each assets fair value to its book value 
we first determine qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived asset is impaired 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived asset is impaired  then we determine the fair value by using the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the indefinite lived asset 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  for details regarding the results of our indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing performed in fiscal finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  which is principally the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
no impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets in fiscal goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units  which we have identified as our operating segments  and is tested for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to their book value 
we first determine  based on a qualitative assessment  whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we then determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the impairment test continues by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize a non cash impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
qualitative assessments regarding goodwill involve a high degree of judgment and can entail subjective considerations 
the discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions  including operating results forecasts and discount rates 
inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no impairment was identified 
accrued warranties we provide for the estimated costs that may be incurred under product warranties to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these product warranties extend over either a specified period of time  units of production or machine hours depending on the product subject to the warranty 
we accrue a provision for estimated future warranty costs based on the historical relationship of warranty costs to sales 
we periodically review the adequacy of the accrual for product warranties and adjust the warranty percentage and accrued warranty reserve for actual experience as necessary 
pension and postretirement benefits and costs pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include discount rates  expected returns on plan assets  mortality rates and rates of compensation increases  as discussed below 
table of contents discount rates we generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximates the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
we believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
expected returns on plan assets our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  weighted by the allocation of our plan assets 
our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  however  the assumptions are primarily based on long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on the irs prescribed annuitant and non annuitant mortality for under the pension protection act of rates of compensation increases the rates of compensation increases reflect our long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense 
as such  a change in the discount rate and the expected return on net assets would have the following effects on pension expense and the projected benefit obligation as of and for the fiscal year ended october  increase decrease in thousands discount rate expected return on net assets discount rate expected return on net assets us pension plans net pension benefit expense projected decrease increase in benefit obligation non us pension plans net pension benefit expense projected decrease increase in benefit obligation other postretirement benefit plans net pension benefit expense projected decrease increase in benefit obligation income taxes deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria 
as required under the application of fresh start accounting  the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted  then intangible assets until exhausted  and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital 
consequently  a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained 
as of october   there were million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards 
all future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year on an interim basis 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from these estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
additionally  discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis 
table of contents and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized 
to the extent recognized  these items will impact the effective tax rate in the aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same year 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of october  and october   respectively 
in thousands october  october  accounts receivable  net inventories trade accounts payable advance payments and progress billings trade working capital other current assets short term notes payable  including current portion of long term obligations employee compensation and benefits accrued warranties other accrued liabilities working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents working capital we currently use trade working capital and cash flow from operations as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we require trade working capital investment because our service model requires us to maintain certain inventory levels in order to maximize our customers machine availability 
this information also provides management with a focus on our receivable terms and collectability efforts and our ability to obtain advance payments on original equipment orders 
as part of our continuous improvement of our purchasing and manufacturing processes  we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules 
cash provided by continuing operations for fiscal was million  compared to million provided by continuing operations in fiscal the increase in cash provided by continuing operations was primarily due to the collection of accounts receivables and a reduction in inventories 
these improvements were partially offset by lower earnings  a reduction in advance payments resulting from lower original equipment orders and a reduction in accrued liabilities resulting from the timing of income tax payments 
cash used by investing activities for fiscal was million  compared to million used by investing activities in fiscal the decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to our acquisition of a controlling interest in imm of million in fiscal  which was funded in part with a million cash deposit that was placed into an escrow account in anticipation of completing the transaction 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal was million  compared to million used by financing activities in fiscal the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to share repurchases of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal financing activities in fiscal primarily related to the borrowing and subsequent repayment of a million term loan for the acquisition of imm 
during each quarter of fiscal we paid a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock resulting in million in dividends paid during the fiscal year 
in addition  on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock 
this dividend will be paid on december  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december  in fiscal  we expect capital spending to be between million and million 
capital projects will be focused on continuing investments for the build out of our global service infrastructure 
retiree benefits 
table of contents we sponsor pension plans in the us and in other countries 
the significance of the funding requirements of these plans are largely dependent on the value of the plan assets  the investment returns on the plan assets  actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  and the impact of the pension protection act of during fiscal  we contributed million to our defined benefit employee pension plans  and we expect to contribute approximately million to million in fiscal as of october   we have a net unfunded pension and other postretirement liability of million 
credit facilities and senior notes on october   we entered into a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on november  as amended  the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  we also may request an increase of up to million of additional aggregate revolving commitments  subject to terms and conditions contained in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement simultaneously replaced the million revolving credit agreement  dated october  the prior credit agreement  that had been set to expire on november  under the terms of the credit agreement  we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating 
letters of credit issued under applicable provisions of the credit agreement represent an unfunded utilization of the credit agreement for purposes of calculating the periodic commitment fee due 
eurodollar rate loans bear interest for a period from the applicable borrowing date until a date one or two weeks or one  two  three or six months thereafter  as selected by the company  at the corresponding eurodollar rate plus a margin of to depending upon our credit rating 
base rate loans bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate equal to i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate  or c a daily rate equal to the one month eurodollar rate plus  plus ii a margin that varies according to the company credit rating 
swing line loans bear interest at either the base rate described above or the daily floating eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin  as selected by the company 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  including leverage and interest coverage ratios 
the credit agreement also restricts payment of dividends or other returns of capital to shareholders when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a stated amount 
as of october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital 
in connection with our entry into the credit agreement  we terminated the prior credit agreement and used a portion of the proceeds available under the credit agreement to repay our million term loan credit agreement  dated october  the further term loan  which was to have matured in june the further term loan was drawn in full on february  in conjunction with the settlement of the imm tender offer 
concurrent with our entry into the credit agreement  all amounts outstanding under the prior credit agreement and further term loan were repaid in full 
as of october   there were no direct borrowings under the credit agreement 
outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement  which count toward the billion credit limit  totaled million 
as of october   there was million available for borrowings under the credit agreement 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement  which matures june   and provided for a million term loan commitment the term loan  which was drawn in full to partially finance the fiscal acquisition of letourneau 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments and contains terms and conditions that are the same as the terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
the term loan is guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  including leverage and interest coverage ratios 
as of october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the term loan

interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations 
we have a combination of fixed and variable rate debt see note  borrowings and credit facilities  and interest rate movements impact the value of fixed rate debt and cash flows on variable rate debt 
as of october   we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials  including steel and copper  that are subject to price volatility caused by systematic risks 
although future movements in raw material prices are unpredictable  we manage this risk through periodic purchases of raw materials and passing some or all of our price increases to our customers 
as of october   we were not a party to any commodity forward contracts 
foreign currency risk we have a risk averse foreign currency exchange risk management policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are hedged 
exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives 
we hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in a non functional foreign currency  which include future committed receipts or payments  and certain entity net balance sheet accounts denominated in a non functional currency 
these exposures normally arise from the import and export of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity 
assets and liabilities of international operations that have a functional currency that is not the us dollar are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates and revenue and expense items are translated using weighted average exchange rates 
any adjustments arising on translation are included in shareholders equity as an element of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are not hedged 
assets and liabilities of operations which have the us dollar as their functional currency  but which maintain their accounting records in local currency  have their values remeasured into us dollars at year end exchange rates  except for non monetary items for which historical rates are used 
exchange gains or losses arising on remeasurement of the values into us dollars are recognized in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
exchange gains or losses incurred on transactions conducted by one of our subsidiaries in a currency other than the subsidiary s functional currency are normally reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
an exception is made when the transaction is a long term intercompany loan that is not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future  in which case the exchange gains or losses are included in shareholders equity as an element of accumulated other comprehensive income loss
