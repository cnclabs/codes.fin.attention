our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences industry 
this industry depends on a broad range of tests  called bioassays  to perform diagnostic tests and conduct life science research 
our xmap technology  an open architecture  multiplexing technology  allows simultaneous analysis of up to bioassays from a small sample volume  typically a single drop of fluid  by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres 
xmap technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers  digital signal processors and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed  precision  flexibility and cost 
our xmap technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the fields of drug discovery and development  and for clinical diagnostics  genetic analysis  bio defense  food safety and biomedical research 
in addition to our xmap technology  our other offerings include our proprietary multicode technology  used for real time pcr and multiplexed pcr assays  as well as automation and robotics in the field of dry sample handling 
our end user customers and partners  which include laboratory professionals performing research  clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by a physician and other laboratories  have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible 
luminex has adopted a business model built  in part  around strategic partnerships 
we have licensed our xmap technology to partner companies  which in turn then develop products that incorporate the xmap technology into products that our partners sell to end users 
we develop and manufacture the proprietary xmap laboratory instrumentation and the proprietary xmap microspheres and sell these products to our partners 
our partners then sell xmap instrumentation and xmap based reagent consumable products  which run on the instrumentation  to the end user laboratory 
as of december   luminex had approximately strategic partners  of which have released commercialized reagent based products utilizing our technology 
luminex has several forms of revenue that result from our business model system revenue is generated from the sale of our xmap multiplexing analyzers and peripherals and automated punching laboratory instruments 
consumable revenue is generated from the sale of our dyed polystyrene microspheres and sheath and drive fluid 
our larger commercial and development partners often purchase these consumables in bulk to minimize the number of incoming qualification events and to allow for longer development and production runs 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells our proprietary microspheres to an end user  a partner sells a kit incorporating our proprietary microspheres to an end user or when a partner utilizes a kit to provide a testing result to a user 
end users can be facilities such as testing labs  development facilities and research facilities that buy prepared kits and have specific testing needs or testing service companies that provide assay results to pharmaceutical research companies or physicians 
assay revenue is generated from the sale of our kits which are a combination of chemical and biological reagents and our proprietary xmap bead technology used to perform diagnostic and research assays on samples as well as real time pcr and multiplexed pcr assays using our proprietary multicode technology 
service revenue is generated when a partner or other owner of a system purchases a service contract from us after the standard warranty has expired or pays us for our time and materials to service instruments 
service contract revenue is amortized over the life of the contract and the costs associated with those contracts are recognized as incurred 
other revenue consists of items such as training  shipping  parts sales  license revenue  grant revenue  contract research and development fees  milestone revenue and other items that individually amount to less than of total revenue 

table of contents highlights luminex grew total revenue over revenue to million 
gross margin percentage of  up from in assay revenue increased over the prior calendar year 
system shipments of multiplexing analyzers  resulting in cumulative life to date multiplexing analyzer shipments of  up from a year ago 
partners reported over million of royalty bearing end user sales on xmap technology for the year  a increase over extended our global sales and distribution agreement with bio rad laboratories  inc to  including the grant of global sales and distribution rights for our magpix multiplexing instrument 
received ce marking of both the xmap neoplex assay and neoplex system 
this system changes the way newborn screening is performed  providing four assays from one blood spot punch  reducing sample requirements and improving laboratory efficiency 
received a contract of up to million over three and a half years by the defense threat reduction agency of the us department of defense to fund development of a prototype biothreat detection instrument 
acquired genturadx  a molecular diagnostics company focused on making nucleic acid testing both affordable and practical for any laboratory 
consumables sales and royalty revenue trends we have experienced significant fluctuations in consumable revenue over the past three years 
overall  the fluctuations manifested themselves through periodic changes in volume from our largest bulk purchasing partners 
from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we had quarterly bulk purchases varying from million to million and representing between and of total consumable revenue 
we expect these fluctuations to continue as the ordering pattern of our largest bulk purchasing partner remains variable  however  our other bulk purchasing customers are less variable in their ordering patterns 
additionally  even though we experience variability in consumable revenue  the key indicator of the success of our partners commercialization efforts is the rising level of royalties and reported royalty bearing sales during the past several years 
change in cash position our cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  to million from million at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the acquisition of genturadx for million net cash  stock repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million  offset by operating cash flows of million 
segment information luminex has two reportable segments the technology and strategic partnerships tsp segment and the assays and related products arp segment 
the tsp segment  which is our original  base business  consists of system sales to partners and end customers  raw bead sales  royalties  service and support of the technology  and other miscellaneous items 
the arp segment is primarily involved in the development and sale of assays on xmap and multicode technology for use on luminex s installed base of systems 
future operations we expect our areas of focus over the next twelve months to be maintenance and improvement of our existing products and the timely development  completion and successful commercial launch of our pipeline products  
table of contents successful execution of our direct sales strategy  including the infrastructure necessary to support our sales force  commercialization  regulatory clearance and market adoption of output from the arp segment  including the neoplex system  neoplex assay  cypc  gastrointestinal pathogen panel  and the related clearance of our magpix and fmd instruments  continued execution of our biothreat initiatives  the expansion and enhancement of our installed base and our market position within our identified target market segments  the effect of the ongoing uncertainty in global finance markets and changes in government funding on planned purchases by end users  the continued adoption and development of partner products incorporating luminex technology through effective partner management  and development of the next generation sample to answer platform for our multicode rtx technology 
we anticipate continued revenue concentration in our higher margin items assays  consumables and royalties contributing to favorable  but variable  gross margin percentages 
additionally  we believe that a sustained investment in research and development is necessary in order to meet the needs of our marketplace and provide a sustainable new product pipeline 
we may experience volatility in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue on a quarterly basis 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements  and the judgments and estimates involved under each 
we also have other significant accounting policies that do not involve critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective 
these are described in note of our consolidated financial statements provided herein in item estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue is generated primarily from the sale of our products and related services  which are primarily support and maintenance services on our systems 
we recognize product revenue at the time the product is shipped provided there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  no right of return exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
there is no customer right of return in our sales agreements 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
we regularly enter into arrangements for system sales that are multiple element arrangements  including services such as installation and training  and multiple products 
these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame  approximately three to six months  of the agreement execution date and can also be performed by one of our third party partners 
based on the terms and conditions of the sale  we believe that these services can be accounted for separately from the delivered system as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand alone basis 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  the estimated selling price of services or products not yet performed or delivered at the time of system shipment are deferred and recognized as revenue as such services are performed 
we have generally been able to determine the selling price of each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement based on the price for such deliverable when it is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is not determinable and when third party evidence is not available  we use the estimated selling price of a deliverable which is determined based upon our pricing policies  expected margin of the deliverable  geographical location and information gathered from customer negotiations 

table of contents within the diagnostic portion of our arp segment  we provide systems and certain other hardware to customers through reagent rental agreements under which the customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price over a defined contract term  which is normally two to three years 
instead of rental payments  we recover the cost of providing the system and other hardware in the amount we charge for our diagnostic assays and other disposables 
revenue is recognized over the defined contract term as assays and other disposable products are shipped 
the depreciation costs associated with the system and other hardware are charged to cost of sales on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the system 
the costs to maintain these instruments in the field are charged to cost of sales as incurred 
revenue from extended service agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenues from royalties related to agreements with strategic partners are recognized when such amounts are reported to the company  therefore  the underlying end user sales may be related to prior periods 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
additional revenue is derived from cost type contracts with the us government 
revenue and profit under cost plus service contracts is recognized as costs are incurred plus negotiated fees 
fixed fees on cost plus service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract performance period as services are performed 
contract costs include labor and related employee benefits  subcontracting costs and other direct costs  as well as allocations of allowable indirect costs 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment is required for estimating the amounts  assessing the potential for realization  and determining whether realization is probable 
from time to time  facts develop that require revisions of revenue recognized or cost estimates 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects the current or an earlier period  the cumulative effect of the revision is recognized in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
reimbursements of certain costs  including certain hardware costs or out of pocket expenses are included in revenue with corresponding costs included in cost of revenue as costs are incurred 
inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined according to the standard cost method 
inventories have been written down through an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are i a specific write down for inventory items that we no longer use in the manufacture of our products or that no longer meet our specifications and ii a write down against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
inventory is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  scientific and technological advances will continue and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
while management believes that adequate reserve has been made in the consolidated financial statements for product warranties  should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
purchase price allocation  intangibles and goodwill 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life 

table of contents goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the assets of the acquired business 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill on a reporting unit level annually or more frequently if there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
all of our goodwill relates to one reporting unit  our arp segment  for goodwill impairment testing 
we have historically estimated the fair value of our arp segment reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis step one analysis of our projected future results 
the step one analysis we performed in the fourth quarter of indicated the fair value our arp segment reporting unit was significantly higher than the carrying value 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  in we early adopted accounting pronouncements related to our goodwill impairment analysis 
the accounting guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount step zero analysis 
in fiscal  we again used this new guidance in our annual impairment analysis for goodwill because our cash flows for our arp segment reporting unit continue to exceed the expectations we had as of our fourth quarter step one analysis  a review of the estimated fair value of the assay segment using the market approach as of the fourth quarter of shows that the estimated fair value of the assay segment exceeded the carrying amount by over  the gap between the estimated fair value of the arp segment and the carrying value of the arp segment is broadening compared to and  and the assay segment revenue growth rate in exceeded the modeled growth rates in our goodwill impairment test performed as of the fourth quarter of accounting for income taxes 
we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  judgment is required 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical income  projected future income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for us federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon 
the gaap guidance requires recognition of the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 
determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments  estimates and the application of complex tax regulations 
we are required to provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate  including estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
although we believe that we have provided adequate liabilities for uncertain tax positions  the actual liability resulting from examinations by taxing authorities could differ from the recorded income tax liabilities and could result in additional income tax expense 
changes of estimates in our income tax liabilities are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which the factors resulting in the change to our estimate become known to us 
as a result  our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
stock compensation 
all stock based compensation cost  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and shares issued under the company s employee stock purchase plan  is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of our stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate of return 
calculation of expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term is calculated using the contractual term of the options as well as an analysis of our historical exercises of stock options 
the estimate of risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  thus we have assumed a dividend yield 

table of contents the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
as part of the requirements of asc  the company is required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly 
the estimate of forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture performance and will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of evaluation and will also impact the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest  except for the limited number of market based awards under long term incentive plans 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income  and net income per share 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenue of certain items in the consolidated statements of operations 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

we expect these fluctuations to continue as the ordering pattern of our largest bulk purchasing partner varies due to their efforts to minimize the number of incoming qualification events  control inventory  and allow for longer development and production runs 
partners who reported royalty bearing sales accounted for million  or  of total consumable sales for the year ended december  royalty revenue  which results when our partners sell products or services incorporating our technology  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we believe this is primarily the result of menu expansion and increased utilization of our partners assays on our technology 
our partners end user sales may reflect volatility from quarter to quarter and therefore  that same volatility is reflected in our reported royalty revenues on a quarterly basis 
additionally  we expect modest fluctuations in the number of commercial partners submitting royalties quarter to quarter based upon the varying contractual terms  consolidations among partners  differing reporting and payment requirements  and the addition of new partners 
for the year ended december   we had commercial partners submit royalties as compared with for the year ended december  additionally  the partners from whom we recognized million in royalties in represented approximately million of the total royalties in  an increase of approximately over their prior year payments 
total royalty bearing sales reported to us by our partners were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service revenue  comprised of extended warranty contracts earned ratably over the term of a contract  increased to million during from million in this increase is attributable to increased penetration of the expanded installed base

cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased by million during the year ended december  the decline in cash  cash equivalents and investments from the prior year is primarily attributable to the purchase of genturadx in july our operating cash flow of million funded both our share repurchase program and capital expenditures 
we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities in conjunction with an initial public offering in  subsequent option exercises  and our follow on public offering in and cash generated from operations

table of contents to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and deployment of our technologies  or to supplement our position through strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all  particularly given the current state of the capital markets 
any downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to raise debt capital on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
debt on december   tm bioscience entered into an agreement with the ministry of industry of the government of canada under which the government agreed to invest up to canadian cdn million relating to the development of several genetic tests 
this agreement was amended in march funds were advanced from technology partnerships canada tpc  a special operating program 
the actual payments we received were predicated on eligible expenditures made during the project period which ended july  we have received cdn million from tpc which is expected to be repaid along with approximately cdn million of imputed interest for a total of approximately cdn million 
we have agreed to repay the tpc funding through a royalty on revenues 
royalty payments commenced in at a rate of of total lmd revenue and at a rate of for and thereafter 
aggregate royalty repayment will continue until total advances plus imputed interest has been repaid or until december   whichever is earlier 
the repayment obligation expires on december  and any unpaid balance will be cancelled and forgiven on that date 
should the term of repayment be shorter than expected due to higher than expected assay revenue  the effective interest rate would increase as repayment is accelerated 
actual future sales generating a repayment obligation will vary from our projections  is subject to adjustment based upon the us and canadian exchange rate and are subject to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report  including under item a risk factors and safe harbor cautionary statement

the amount due within one year  as shown in the table above  is our estimated repayment amount based on the sales for the full year amounts represent those recorded in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note for a more complete description of our contingent earn out obligations 
amounts represent minimum royalties due on net sales of products incorporating licensed technology and subject to a minimum annual royalty payment 
amount represents the payments related to the resolution of our molecular diagnostic assay distribution agreements 
all payments are expected to be made prior to june  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with luminex s unrecognized tax benefits at december   luminex is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
in addition  million of milestone payments under a collaboration agreement have not been included in the table above as it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will make these future potential payments 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a direct adverse effect on our operations to date 
however  a substantial increase in product and manufacturing costs and personnel related expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the event these expenses increase at a faster pace than we can increase our system  consumable and royalty revenue rates 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures 
the new guidance clarified the concepts applicable for fair value measurement of non financial assets and requires the disclosure of quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement 
this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and has been applied prospectively 
the impact of adoption on the company financial position and results of operations was not material 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance eliminated one of the presentation options provided by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap which was to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
in addition  it gave an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and has been applied retrospectively

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued guidance on disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities to converge the presentation of offsetting assets and liabilities between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the guidance requires that entities disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the guidance will be effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after january  we are in the process of evaluating the financial and disclosure impact of this guidance 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations is not expected to be material 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since our investments are in short term and long term instruments available for sale 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield a less than variance in overall investment return  which would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
foreign currency risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to foreign exchange rate volatility  differing tax structures  unique economic conditions  other regulations and restrictions  and changes in political climate 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these and other factors 
as of december   as a result of our foreign operations  we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily canadian and australian dollars and to a lesser extent the euro  renminbi  and yen 
for example  some fixed asset purchases  certain expenses  and the tpc debt of our canadian subsidiary are denominated in canadian dollars while sales of products are primarily denominated in us dollars 
all transactions in our netherlands and japanese subsidiaries are denominated in euros and yen  respectively 
all transactions  with the exception of our initial capital investment  in our chinese subsidiary are denominated in renminbi 
sales transactions in our australian subsidiary are primarily denominated in australian or us dollars while fixed asset purchases and expenses are primarily denominated in australian dollars 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
a significant majority of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of foreign exchange on foreign denominated balances will vary in relation to changes between the us dollar  canadian dollar  australian dollar  euro  yen  and renminbi exchange rates 
a change in these exchange rates in relation to the us dollar would result in an income statement impact of approximately  on foreign currency denominated asset and liability balances as of december  as a result of our efforts to expand globally  in the future we will be exposed to additional foreign currency risk in multiple currencies  however  at this time  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is not currently material 
we regularly assess the market to determine if additional strategies are appropriate to mitigate future risks 
in addition  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations could affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our aggregate foreign currency transaction loss of  was included in determining our consolidated results for the year ended december
