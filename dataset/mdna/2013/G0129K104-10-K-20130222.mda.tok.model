table of contents we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non us gaap measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
accordingly  this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure  or expenses  of the organization 
ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda as defined above further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance as that term is defined in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes 
adjusted ebitda is a material component of these covenants

beginning with our quarterly report for the quarter ended june   we also excluded term financing no 
hedge loss amortization charges which will be reported in interest  net on our consolidated statement of income from the calculation of ani 
the calculation of ani for the years ended december    and has been revised to be comparable with the current period presentation 
management believes that adjusted net income ani when viewed in conjunction with the company results under us gaap and the below reconciliation  provides useful information about operating and period over period performance  and provides additional information that is useful for evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting

overview we are a global company that acquires  leases  and sells high utility commercial jet aircraft to passenger and cargo airlines throughout the world 
high utility aircraft are generally modern  operationally efficient jets with a large operator base and long useful lives 
as of december   our aircraft portfolio consisted of aircraft that were leased to lessees located in countries  and managed through our offices in the united states  ireland and singapore 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
from time to time  we also make investments in other aviation assets  including debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft 
our revenues and net income for the year ended december  were million and million respectively  and for the fourth quarter were million and million  respectively 
revenues our revenues are comprised primarily of operating lease rentals on flight equipment held for lease  revenue from retained maintenance payments related to lease expirations  lease termination payments  lease incentive amortization and interest recognized from finance leases 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays lease rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease and the amount of the contracted rent will depend upon the type  age  specification and condition of the aircraft and market conditions at the time the lease is committed 
the amount of rent we receive will depend on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies  restructurings and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry conditions and trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
under an operating lease  the lessee will be responsible for performing maintenance on the relevant aircraft and will typically be required to make payments to us for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and would be made either monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
for maintenance payments made monthly in arrears during a lease term  we will typically be required to reimburse all or a portion of these payments to the lessee upon their completion of the relevant heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee during a lease as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our obligation in the lease to refund such payments  and therefore we do not recognize maintenance revenue during the lease 
maintenance revenue recognition would occur at the end of a lease  when we are able to determine the amount  if any  by which reserve payments received exceed the amount we are required under the lease to reimburse to the lessee for heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
the amount of maintenance revenue we recognize in any reporting period is inherently 
table of contents volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors  including the timing of lease expiries  including scheduled and unscheduled expiries  the timing of maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft by the lessee 
many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of the lessee costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components 
we account for these expected payments as lease incentives  which are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the lease 
we estimate the amount of our portion for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated cost of the maintenance event and the estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated lease incentive is not recognized as a lease incentive liability at the inception of the lease 
we recognize the lease incentive as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  with the offset being recorded as a lease incentive liability which is included in maintenance payments on the balance sheet 
the payment to the lessee for the lease incentive liability is first recorded against the lease incentive liability and any excess above the lease incentive liability is recorded as a prepaid lease incentive asset which is included in other assets on the balance sheet and continues to amortize over the remaining life of the lease 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of depreciation of flight equipment held for lease  interest expense  selling  general and administrative expenses  aircraft impairment charges and maintenance and other costs 
because our operating lease terms generally require the lessee to pay for operating  maintenance and insurance costs  our portion of maintenance and other costs relating to aircraft reflected in our statement of income primarily relates to expenses for unscheduled lease terminations 
income tax provision we have obtained an assurance from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act that  in the event that any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax shall not  until march  be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares  debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or to any taxes payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda 
consequently  the provision for income taxes recorded relates to income earned by certain subsidiaries of the company which are located in  or earn income in  jurisdictions that impose income taxes  primarily ireland and the united states 
all of our aircraft owning subsidiaries that are recognized as corporations for us tax purposes are us corporations 
these non us subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the united states and typically are not subject to us federal  state or local income taxes unless they operate within the us  in which case they may be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
we also have a us based subsidiary which provides management services to our non us subsidiaries and is subject to non us federal  state and local income taxes 
in addition  those subsidiaries that are resident in ireland are subject to irish tax

finance historically  our debt financing arrangements typically have been secured by aircraft and related operating leases  and in the case of our securitizations  the financing parties have limited recourse to aircastle limited 
while we have continued to access the bank market for debt secured by aircraft  since mid the bulk of our debt financing has been raised in the unsecured bond market 
us capital markets conditions have generally been strong during that period of time  though market volatility could in the future affect the cost or availability of debt we may seek to raise in the us capital markets 
in april  we closed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes due 
we used the net proceeds of the private placement to repay outstanding indebtedness under our term financing no 
 to terminate the associated interest rate derivatives  and to fund general corporate purposes  including the purchase of aviation assets 
in november  we closed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes due 
we used the net proceeds of the private placement for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of aviation assets 
during the near term  we intend to focus our efforts on investment opportunities that are attractive on an unleveraged basis  that tap commercial financial capacity where it is accessible on reasonable terms or for which debt financing that benefits from government guarantees either from the ecas or from exim is available 
we intend to fund new investments through cash on hand  cash flows from operations and potentially through medium to longer term financings on a secured or unsecured basis 
we may repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long term debt financings  additional equity offerings or cash generated from 
table of contents operations and asset sales 
therefore  our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive

summary of recoverability assessment number of aircraft impairment charge dollars in millions transactional impairments a classic a er total transactional impairments annual portfolio review a f er total annual portfolio review impairments total impairments transactional impairments we perform a recoverability assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances  or indicators  indicate that the carrying amount or net book value of an aircraft may not be recoverable 
during  we recorded impairments totaling million related to one aircraft that we sold for less than its net book value  one aircraft that failed its recoverability test following its scheduled return and three aircraft for which we elected not to invest in engine performance restoration visits  and  in conjunction with these activities  we also recorded maintenance revenue and lease incentive reversals aggregating million 

table of contents annual portfolio review we perform a recoverability assessment of all aircraft in our fleet  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  at least annually 
we performed this recoverability assessment during the third quarter of management develops the assumptions used in the recoverability assessment based on its knowledge of active lease contracts  current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry  as well as information received from third party industry sources 
the factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates  residual values  economic conditions  technology  airline demand for a particular aircraft type and other factors 
in particular  many of our assumptions were driven primarily by weak market demand for older technology narrow and wide body model aircraft caused by slowing global economic growth rates  declining business confidence levels and higher fuel prices 
in the case of boeing classic aircraft  production rate increases by both boeing and airbus for newer generation narrowbody aircraft  coupled with slowing demand growth  is enabling more rapid replacement of earlier generation aircraft 
storage levels for these aircraft types have increased during the last twelve months 
following completion of the recoverability analysis  we took the following actions we impaired aircraft and recorded aggregate impairment charges of million to write these aircraft down to current market values 
for these aircraft  the aggregate net book value as of june  was million 
for seven other aircraft that passed the recoverability assessment  we took the following steps shortened the expected lives of one airbus a aircraft  five boeing model er aircraft and one mcdonnell douglas md sf aircraft  primarily to reflect the specific maintenance schedule that we expect for the airframe and related engines 
in the case of our boeing model er aircraft  reduced the residual values to reflect our current estimates 
reducing the expected lives or anticipated residual values for aircraft in our fleet will accelerate the future depreciation on these aircraft  which will be partly offset by reduced depreciation on aircraft that we impaired 
as described above  these changes in depreciation going forward will affect aircraft 
we estimate that there will be no annual increase in depreciation expense for the year ended december   although future depreciation is expected to decrease as these aircraft reach the end of their holding periods 
while we believe that the estimates and related assumptions used in the recoverability assessment are appropriate  actual results could differ from those estimates 
other than the aircraft discussed above  management believes that the net book value of each aircraft is currently supported by the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that aircraft  and accordingly  no other aircraft were impaired as a consequence of this recoverability assessment 
in addition  our lessees may face financial difficulties and return aircraft to us prior to the contractual lease expiry dates 
as a result  our cash flow assumptions may change and future impairment charges may be required 
at december   we had a total of aircraft with a total net book value of million accounting for of the total net book value of our flight equipment held for lease that we consider more susceptible to failing our recoverability assessment 
the recoverability in the value of these aircraft is more sensitive to changes in contractual cash flows  future cash flow estimates and aircraft residual or scrap values 
these aircraft fall into the categories as shown in the table below aircraft type number of aircraft percent of net book value narrowbody midbody freighters 
table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and currently available information 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most subjective judgments  estimates and assumptions 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
lease revenue recognition our operating lease rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we will neither recognize revenue nor record a receivable from a customer when collectability is not reasonably assured 
estimating whether collectability is reasonably assured requires some level of subjectivity and judgment 
when collectability is not reasonably assured  the customer is placed on non accrual status and revenue is recognized when cash payments are received 
management determines whether customers should be placed on non accrual status 
when we are reasonably assured that payments will be received in a timely manner  the customer is placed on accrual status 
the accrual non accrual status of a customer is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on factors such as the customer s credit rating  payment performance  financial condition and requests for modifications of lease terms and conditions 
events or circumstances outside of historical customer patterns can also result in changes to a customer s accrual status 
maintenance payments and maintenance revenue under our leases  the lessee must pay operating expenses accrued or payable during the term of the lease  which would normally include maintenance  overhaul  fuel  crew  landing  airport and navigation charges  certain taxes  licenses  consents and approvals  aircraft registration  and insurance premiums 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays lease rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease  and the amount of the contracted rent will depend upon the type  age  specification and condition of the aircraft and market conditions at the time the lease is committed 
the amount of rent we receive will depend on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies  restructurings and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry conditions and trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
under an operating lease  the lessee will be responsible for performing maintenance on the relevant aircraft and will typically be required to make payments to us for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and would be made either monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
for maintenance payments made monthly in arrears during a lease term  we will typically be required to reimburse all or a portion of these payments to the lessee upon completion of the relevant heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee during a lease as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our obligation in the lease to refund such payments  and therefore we do not recognize maintenance revenue during the lease 
maintenance revenue recognition would occur at the end of a lease  when we are able to determine the amount  if any  by which reserve payments received exceed the amount we are required under the lease to reimburse to the lessee for heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
the amount of maintenance revenue we recognize in any reporting period is inherently volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors  including the timing of lease expiries  including scheduled and unscheduled expiries  the timing of maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft by the lessee 
lease incentives and amortization many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of the lessee s costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components 
we account for these expected payments as lease incentives  
table of contents which are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the lease 
we estimate the amount of our portion for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated cost of the maintenance event and the estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated lease incentive is not recognized as a lease incentive liability at the inception of the lease 
we recognize the lease incentive as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  with the offset being recorded as a lease incentive liability  which is included in maintenance payments on the balance sheet 
the payment to the lessee for the lease incentive liability is first recorded against the lease incentive liability  and any excess above the lease incentive liability is recorded as a prepaid lease incentive asset  which is included in other assets on the balance sheet and continues to amortize over the remaining life of the lease 
flight equipment held for lease and depreciation flight equipment held for lease is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  typically over a year life from the date of manufacture for passenger aircraft and over a to year life for freighter aircraft  depending on whether the aircraft is a converted or purpose built freighter  to estimated residual values 
estimated residual values are generally determined to be approximately of the manufacturer s estimated realized price for passenger aircraft when new and for freighter aircraft when new 
management may make exceptions to this policy on a case by case basis when  in its judgment  the residual value calculated pursuant to this policy does not appear to reflect current expectations of value 
examples of situations where exceptions may arise include but are not limited to flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturers realized sales prices are not relevant eg  freighter conversions  flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturers realized sales prices are not readily available  and flight equipment which may have a shorter useful life due to obsolescence 
in accounting for flight equipment held for lease  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  the fair value of attached leases  acquired maintenance liabilities and the estimated residual values 
in making these estimates  we rely upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
as part of our due diligence review of each aircraft we purchase  we prepare an estimate of the expected maintenance payments and any excess costs which may become payable by us  taking into consideration the then current maintenance status of the aircraft and the relevant provisions of any existing lease 
for planned major maintenance activities for aircraft off lease  the company capitalizes the actual maintenance costs by applying the deferral method 
under the deferral method  we capitalize the actual cost of major maintenance events  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over the period until the next maintenance event is required 
when we acquire an aircraft with a lease  determining the fair value of the attached lease requires us to make assumptions regarding the current fair values of leases for specific aircraft 
we estimate a range of current lease rates of like aircraft in order to determine if the attached lease is within a fair value range 
if a lease is below or above the range of current lease rates  we present value the estimated amount below or above fair value range over the remaining term of the lease 
the resulting lease discount or premium is amortized into lease rental income over the remaining term of the lease 
impairment of flight equipment we perform a recoverability assessment of all aircraft in our fleet  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  at least annually 
in addition  a recoverability assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances  or indicators  indicate that the carrying amount or net book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
indicators may include  but are not limited to  a significant lease restructuring or early lease termination  significant air traffic decline  the introduction of newer technology aircraft or engines  an aircraft type is no longer in production or a significant airworthiness directive is issued 
when we perform a recoverability assessment  we measure whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the aircraft exceed its net book value 
the undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted leases  future projected lease rates  transition costs  estimated down time and estimated residual or scrap values for an aircraft 
in the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test  the aircraft will be adjusted to fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
see further discussion under fair value measurements below 
management develops the assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry  
table of contents as well as information received from third party industry sources 
the factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates  residual values  economic conditions  technology  airline demand for a particular aircraft type and many of the risk factors discussed in item a 
risk factors 
net investment in finance leases if a lease meets specific criteria at the inception of a new lease or at any lease modification date  we recognize the lease as a net investment in finance leases on our consolidated balance sheets 
the net investment in finance leases consists of lease receivables  less the unearned income  plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the leased flight equipment at the lease end date 
the unearned income is recognized as other revenue in our consolidated statements of income over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in finance lease 
collectability of finance leases is evaluated periodically on an individual customer level 
the evaluation of the collectability of the finance leases considers the credit of the lessee and the value of the underlying aircraft 
an allowance for credit losses is established if there is evidence that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the net investment in finance leases 
at december   we had no allowance for credit losses for our net investment in finance leases 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
all interest rate derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we determine fair value for our united states dollar denominated interest rate derivatives by calculating reset rates and discounting cash flows based on cash rates  futures rates and swap rates in effect at the period close 
we determine the fair value of our united states dollar denominated guaranteed notional balance interest rate derivatives based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close 
the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the interest rate derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
the ineffective portion of the interest rate derivative is calculated and recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income at each quarter end 
for any interest rate derivatives not designated as a hedge  all mark to market adjustments are recognized in other income expense on our consolidated statement of income 
at inception of the hedge  we choose a method to assess effectiveness and to calculate ineffectiveness  which we must use for the life of the hedge relationship 
historically  we have designated the change in variable cash flows method for calculation of hedge ineffectiveness 
this methodology  which is only available for interest rate derivatives designated at execution with a fair value of zero  involves a comparison of the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the interest rate derivative against the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
when the change in the interest rate derivative s variable leg exceeds the change in the liability  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
effectiveness is tested by dividing the change in the interest rate derivative s variable leg by the change in the liability 
we used the hypothetical trade method for hedge relationships designated after execution because those hedge relationships did not have an interest rate derivative fair value of zero  and therefore  did not qualify for the change in variable cash flow method 
the hypothetical trade method involves a comparison of the change in the fair value of an actual interest rate derivative to the change in the fair value of a hypothetical interest rate derivative with critical terms that reflect the hedged debt 
when the change in the value of the interest rate derivative exceeds the change in the hypothetical interest rate derivative  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
the effectiveness of these relationships is tested by regressing historical changes in the interest rate derivative against historical changes in the hypothetical interest rate derivative 
fair value measurements we measure the fair value of interest rate derivative assets and liabilities on a recurring basis 
fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level maximizes the use of observable inputs  including contractual terms  interest rate curves  cash rates and futures rates and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs  including an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative 
table of contents assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we use our interest rate derivative counterparty s valuation of our interest rate derivatives to validate our models 
our interest rate derivatives are sensitive to market changes in libor as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level includes a significant unobservable market input to value the option component of the guaranteed notional balance 
the guaranteed notional balance has an upper notional band that matches the hedged debt on term financing no 
and a lower notional band 
the notional balance is guaranteed to match the hedged debt balance if the debt balances decrease within the upper and lower notional band 
the range of the guaranteed notional between the upper and lower band represents an option that may not be exercised independently of the debt notional balance 
the fair value of the interest rate derivative is determined based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at the relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close and incorporates an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we measure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities on a non recurring basis  when us gaap requires the application of fair value  including events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
assets subject to these measurements include aircraft 
we record aircraft at fair value when we determine the carrying value may not be recoverable 
fair value measurements for aircraft impaired are based on an income approach that uses level inputs  which include our assumptions and appraisal data as to future cash proceeds from leasing and selling aircraft 
income taxes aircastle uses an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount estimated by us to be realizable 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits 
recent unadopted accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an exposure draft  leases the lease ed  which would replace the existing guidance in the accounting standards codification asc asc  leases 
in june  the fasb decided that leases would be classified as either leases of property or leases of assets other than property 
leases of property will continue to use operating lease accounting 
leases of other than property would use the receivable residual approach 
under the receivable residual approach  a lease receivable would be recognized for the lessor right to receive lease payments  a portion of the carrying amount of the underlying asset would be allocated between the right of use granted to the lessee and the lessor residual value and profit or loss would only be recognized at commencement if it is reasonably assured 
the fasb completed all of its deliberations and decided to re expose the lease ed in the first half of we anticipate that the final standard may have an effective date no earlier than when and if the proposed guidance becomes effective  it may have a significant impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
although we believe the presentation of our financial statements  and those of our lessees could change  we do not believe the accounting pronouncement will change the fundamental economic reasons for which the airlines lease aircraft 
therefore  we do not believe it will have a material impact on our business 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity currently are cash on hand  cash generated by our aircraft leasing operations  loans secured by new aircraft we acquire and unsecured borrowings 
our business is very capital intensive  requiring significant investments in order to expand our fleet during periods of growth and investments in maintenance and improvements on our existing portfolio 
our business also generates a significant amount of cash from operations  primarily from lease rentals and maintenance collections 
these sources have historically provided liquidity for these investments and for other uses  
table of contents including the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
in the past  we have also met our liquidity and capital resource needs by utilizing several sources  including lines of credit  our securitizations  term financings  secured borrowings supported by export credit agencies for new aircraft acquisitions and bank financings secured by aircraft purchases  unsecured indebtedness  including an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes  public offerings of common shares  and asset sales 
going forward  we expect to continue to seek liquidity from these sources subject to pricing and conditions that we consider satisfactory 
in december  we closed a million unsecured revolving credit facility with citibank  na  goldman sachs bank usa  na morgan chase bank na and an affiliate of rbc capital markets  which has a three year term scheduled to expire in december  we have not yet drawn down on this facility 
in april  we closed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due both the senior notes due and the senior notes due were priced at par 
we used the net proceeds of the private placement to repay outstanding indebtedness under our term financing no 
 to terminate the associated interest rate derivatives and to fund general corporate purposes  including the purchase of aviation assets 
in november  we closed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which were priced at par 
we used the net proceeds of the private placement for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of aviation assets 
while the financing structures for our securitizations include liquidity facilities  these liquidity facilities are primarily designed to provide short term liquidity to enable the financing vehicles to remain current on interest payments during periods when the relevant entities incur substantial unanticipated expenditures 
because these facilities have priority in the payment waterfall and therefore must be repaid quickly  and because we do not anticipate being required to draw on these facilities to cover operating expenses  we do not view these liquidity facilities as an important source of liquidity for us 
as of december   we are in compliance with all applicable covenants in our financings 
we have also determined as of december  that our consolidated subsidiaries restricted net assets as defined by rule e of regulation s x are less than percent of our consolidated net assets 
in may  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common shares 
in august  we repurchased  shares from affiliates of fortress investment group llc at a total cost of million under the repurchase program and we paid no commissions on this transaction 
in november  the company board of directors authorized an increase in the company share repurchase program by up to an additional million of its common shares  bringing the total back up to million of its common shares 
through december   we repurchased an additional  shares at a total cost of million including commissions 
in addition  as of february   we repurchased an additional  common shares at an aggregate cost of million including commissions during accordingly  as of february   we have repurchased under this program a total of  common shares at a total cost of million including commissions  at an average price per share of  and the remaining dollar value of common shares that may be purchased under the program is million 
we believe that cash on hand  funds generated from operations  maintenance payments received from lessees  and proceeds from any future contracted aircraft sales will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months 
our liquidity and capital resource needs include payments due under our other aircraft purchase commitments  required principal and interest payments under our long term debt facilities  expected capital expenditures  lessee maintenance payment draws and lease incentive payments over the next twelve months

these expenditures include the cost of major overhauls necessary to place an aircraft in service and modifications made at the request of lessees 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred a total of million  million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures including lease incentives related to the acquisition and improvement of aircraft 
as of december   the weighted average age by net book value of our aircraft was approximately years 
in general  the costs of operating an aircraft  including maintenance expenditures  increase with the age of the aircraft 
under our leases  the lessee is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft 
we may incur additional maintenance and modification costs in the future in the event we are required to remarket an aircraft  or a lessee fails to meet its maintenance obligations under the lease agreement 
at december   we had a million maintenance payment liability on our balance sheet  which is a million increase from december  the increase primarily consisted of net maintenance cash inflows of million and a decrease in lease incentive liabilities of million 
these maintenance reserves are paid by the lessee to provide for future maintenance events 
provided a lessee performs scheduled maintenance of the aircraft  we are required to reimburse the lessee for scheduled maintenance payments 
in certain cases  we are also 
table of contents required to make lessor contributions  in excess of amounts a lessee may have paid  towards the costs of maintenance events performed by or on behalf of the lessee 
actual maintenance payments to us by lessees in the future may be less than projected as a result of a number of factors  including defaults by the lessees 
maintenance reserves may not cover the entire amount of actual maintenance expenses incurred and  where these expenses are not otherwise covered by the lessees  there can be no assurance that our operational cash flow and maintenance reserves will be sufficient to fund maintenance requirements  particularly as our aircraft age 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business risks related to our leases if lessees are unable to fund their maintenance obligations on our aircraft  our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common shares could be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  foreign currency risk and foreign operations at december   all of our leases are payable to us in us dollars 
however  we incur euro and singapore dollar denominated expenses in connection with our subsidiary in ireland and branch office in singapore 
for the year ended december   expenses  such as payroll and office costs  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar aggregated approximately million in us dollar equivalents and represented approximately of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
our international operations are a significant component of our business strategy and permit us to more effectively source new aircraft  service the aircraft we own and maintain contact with our lessees 
therefore  it is likely that our international operations and our exposure to foreign currency risk will increase over time 
although we have not yet entered into foreign currency hedges because our exposure to date has not been significant  if our foreign currency exposure increases we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to mitigate this risk 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred insignificant net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
hedging the objective of our hedging policy is to adopt a risk averse position with respect to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have entered into a number of interest rate derivatives to hedge the current and expected future interest rate payments on our variable rate debt 
interest rate derivatives are agreements in which a series of interest rate cash flows are exchanged with a third party over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on an interest rate derivative is not exchanged 
our interest rate derivatives typically provide that we make fixed rate payments and receive floating rate payments to convert our floating rate borrowings to fixed rate obligations to better match the largely fixed rate cash flows from our investments in flight equipment

we do not believe that our financial results have been  or will be  adversely affected by inflation in a material way 
management s use of ebitda and adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non us gaap measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
accordingly  this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure  or expenses  of the organization 
ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda as defined above further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance as that term is defined in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes 
adjusted ebitda is a material component of these covenants 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income to ebitda for the years ended december   and  and the three months ended december   respectively

the calculation of ani for the years ended december  and have been revised to be comparable with the current period presentation

limitations of ebitda  adjusted ebitda and ani an investor or potential investor may find ebitda  adjusted ebitda and ani important measures in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use these non us gaap measures to supplement our us gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and ani have limitations as analytical tools and should not be viewed in isolation or as substitutes for us gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate ebitda  adjusted ebitda and ani  and using these non us gaap measures as compared to us gaap net income  income from continuing operations and cash flows provided by or used in operations  include depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our aircraft  which affects the aircraft s availability for use and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  the cash portion of income tax benefit provision generally represents charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results  
table of contents elements of our interest rate derivative accounting may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our hedging policy  hedge loss amortization charges related to term financing no 
 and adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance as that term is defined in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and ani are not alternatives to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
you should not rely on these non us gaap measures as a substitute for any such us gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliations to us gaap net income  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because ebitda  adjusted ebitda and ani are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and ani as presented in this annual report  may differ from and may not be comparable to  similarly titled measures used by other companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates 
these risks are highly sensitive to many factors  including us monetary and tax policies  us and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control 
we are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our lease agreements  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate derivatives 
rent payments under our aircraft lease agreements typically do not vary during the term of the lease according to changes in interest rates 
however  our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index  such as libor 
therefore  to the extent our borrowing costs are not fixed  increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities 
changes in interest rates may also impact our net book value as our interest rate derivatives are periodically marked to market through shareholders equity 
generally  we are exposed to loss on our fixed pay interest rate derivatives to the extent interest rates decrease below their contractual fixed rate 
the relationship between spreads on derivative instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decrease 
changes in the general level of interest rates can also affect our ability to acquire new investments and our ability to realize gains from the settlement of such assets 
sensitivity analysis the following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of hypothetical interest rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe a sensitivity analysis provides the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec  it is constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by the inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
although the following results of a sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rates may have some limited use as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as a forecast 
this forward looking disclosure also is selective in nature and addresses only the potential interest expense impacts on our financial instruments and  in particular  does not address the mark to market impact on our interest rate derivatives 
it also does not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of changes in interest rates 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rate on our borrowings would result in an interest expense increase decrease of million and million  respectively  net of amounts received from our interest rate derivatives  over the next twelve months
