executive summary we are primarily engaged in the ownership  management  development  acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities 
as of december   we owned interests in  operated  or were developing multifamily properties comprising  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table 
in addition  we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 
property operations our results for the year ended december  reflect an increase in rental revenue as compared to  which we believe was primarily due to a gradually improving economy  favorable demographics  a modest supply of new multifamily housing  and a decrease in home ownership rates which have resulted in increases in realized rental rates and average occupancy levels 
same store revenues increased in  following a increase in we believe us economic and employment growth will continue during and the supply of new multifamily homes  although increasing  will continue to be below historical levels 
however  we believe significant risks to the economy remain prevalent  and while there have been increases in employment levels in the majority of our markets  the unemployment rate remains at higher than historical levels 
if economic conditions in the united states were to worsen  our operating results could be adversely affected 
development activity during the year ended december   we completed construction of seven development projects  including one community containing units owned by one of our discretionary funds in which we have a ownership interest 
as of december   five of these projects reached stabilization 
at december   we had a total of nine development projects under construction containing  units  including two development projects containing units owned by one of our discretionary funds  with initial occupancy expected within the next months 
excluding the development projects owned by one of our discretionary funds  we have remaining expected costs to complete of approximately million on the seven consolidated projects under construction as of december  acquisitions during the year ended december   we acquired twenty operating properties in nine transactions totaling approximately million  including the assumption of approximately million in secured debt 
thirteen of these operating properties were owned by former unconsolidated joint ventures in which we acquired the remaining ownership interests 
we also acquired approximately acres of land in four transactions for approximately million and intend to utilize these land holdings for development of multifamily apartment communities 
we funded these acquisitions through cash generated from operations  proceeds from our at the market share offering programs atm programs  proceeds from an equity offering completed in january  proceeds from a debt offering completed in december and proceeds from property dispositions 
during the year ended december   one of our discretionary funds acquired one operating property and two land holdings totaling acres  which it intends to utilize for development of multifamily apartment communities 
dispositions during the year ended december   we sold eleven operating properties consisting of  units for approximately million and recognized a gain of approximately million on these transactions 
during january  we sold one operating property consisting of units 
during the year ended december   two of our unconsolidated joint ventures sold seven operating properties consisting of  units for approximately million 
our proportionate share of the gains on these transactions was approximately million 

table of contents future outlook subject to market conditions  we intend to continue to look for opportunities to expand our development pipeline and acquire existing communities 
we continually evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities develop 
we also intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations  maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios  and controlling overhead costs 
we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operations  available cash balances  draws on our unsecured credit facility  proceeds from property dispositions  equity issued from our atm program  the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement and secured mortgages 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and no balances outstanding on our million unsecured line of credit 
as of the date of this filing  we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million remaining available for sale under our atm program 
we believe payments on debt maturing in are manageable at million  which represents approximately of our total outstanding debt and includes scheduled principal amortizations of approximately million 
in january  we repaid a million secured conventional mortgage note which was scheduled to mature in april we believe we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover near term debt maturities and new development funding requirements 
we will  however  continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements

we had current income tax expense of approximately million  million  and million for the tax years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in income tax expense during as compared to and the increase in income tax expense during as compared to was due to approximately million associated with income taxes from the gain recognized on the sale of our available for sale investment during the first quarter of by a taxable reit subsidiary 
the increase in as compared to was partially offset by a decrease in taxable income related to our third party construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary 
funds from operations ffo management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  impairments of depreciable assets  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including certain non controlling interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties  and depreciation  ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate investments between periods or as compared to different companies 
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

table of contents reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december are as follows in thousands funds from operations net income attributable to common shareholders real estate depreciation and amortization  including discontinued operations adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures gain on acquisition of controlling interests in joint ventures gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture properties gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests gain on sale of properties and discontinued operations  net of tax income allocated to non controlling interests funds from operations diluted weighted average shares basic incremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of common share options and share awards granted common units weighted average shares diluted includes a million charge related to a loss on discontinuation of a hedging relationship for the year ended december  the gain in represents our proportionate share of the gain on sale of seven operating properties sold during by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
the gain in represents our proportionate share of the gain on sale of four operating properties sold by an unconsolidated joint venture during liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility  which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available 
we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt  maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios  and using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity 
our interest expense coverage ratio  net of capitalized interest  was approximately   and times for the years ended december    and  respectively 
this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses  non property income  other expenses  income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation  amortization  and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations 
at december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered 
our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately years at december  we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which are generating positive cash flows from operations  maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios  and controlling overhead costs 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
other sources include available cash balances  the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings  proceeds from dispositions  equity issued from our atm program  the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement and secured mortgages 

table of contents we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during including normal recurring operating expenses  current debt service requirements  including debt maturities  recurring capital expenditures  initial funding of property developments  acquisitions  joint venture investments  and the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets  sources of financing  our ability to complete asset purchases or sales  the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 
cash flows certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  and repurchases of debt and common shares  are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon  among other factors  market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to growth in property revenues directly attributable to increased rental and occupancy rates from our same store communities and the growth in non same store communities as we consolidated twelve joint ventures in the first quarter of and one unconsolidated joint venture in december the increase in non same store revenues also related to acquisitions of seven operating properties completed in this increase in revenues was partially offset by the increase in property expenses from our same store and non same store communities related to the above noted activity 
see further discussions of our operations as compared to in our results of operations 
net cash used by investing activities during the year ended december  totaled approximately million as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  cash outflows for property development and capital improvements were approximately million during as compared to approximately million during due primarily to an increase in construction and development activity in as compared to the property development and capital improvements during included expenditures for new development  including land  of approximately million  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  and other capitalized indirect costs of approximately million  approximately million related to redevelopment expenditures  and approximately million of other capital expenditures 
the property development and capital improvements during included expenditures for new development  including land  of approximately million  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  and other capitalized indirect costs of approximately million  approximately million related to redevelopment expenditures  and approximately million of other capital expenditures 
additional cash outflows used in investing activities during the year ended december  related to acquisitions of seven operating properties and the controlling interests in thirteen former joint ventures  net of cash acquired totaling approximately million 
during  we also used approximately million for investments in joint ventures relating to acquisitions of an operating property and two land development properties by one of our funds  in which we own a interest 
during  cash outflows for investments in joint ventures were approximately million due to eighteen acquisitions of operating properties completed by our funds 
during the year ended december   cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of approximately million from the sale of eleven operating properties 
cash outflows were further offset by distributions of investments from joint ventures of approximately million during the year ended december   which included million in distributions of investments from two unconsolidated joint ventures relating to the sale of seven operating properties in the third and fourth quarters of distributions of investments from joint ventures received during the year ended december  was approximately million 
during  cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our interests in three unconsolidated joint ventures in march  approximately million from the sale of two land development properties to one of our joint ventures  and approximately million from the sale of two operating properties to unaffiliated third parties 
these outflows were further offset by proceeds received from the sale of our available for sale investment of million during february  and payments received on notes receivable from affiliates of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to million used during the year ended december  during  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of million shares from our atm programs and through an equity offering 
table of contents completed in january cash inflows during also included proceeds of approximately million relating to issuance of million unsecured notes payable completed in december and proceeds of approximately million from common share options exercised during the period 
the inflow during was partially offset by approximately million used to repay the mortgage debt of twelve former joint ventures we acquired in january  and million used to repay maturing secured and unsecured notes payable 
cash inflows during this period were also offset by approximately million used to redeem our perpetual preferred units and approximately million used for distributions paid to common shareholders  perpetual preferred unit holders  and non controlling interest holders 
during we used approximately million to repay our outstanding million term loan and maturing secured and unsecured notes 
we also used approximately million during this period for distributions paid to common shareholders  perpetual preferred unit holders  and non controlling interest holders 
the cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately million provided from the issuance of two series of unsecured notes completed in june  net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of million common shares under our atm programs  and net proceeds of approximately million provided from common share options exercised during the period 
financial flexibility we have a million unsecured credit facility which matures in september with an option to extend at our election to september additionally  we have the option to increase this credit facility to million by either adding additional banks to the credit facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks in the credit facility to increase their commitments 
the interest rate is based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change 
advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates  or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates 
these bid rate loans have terms of days or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 
we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations 
our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit 
while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit  it does reduce the amount available 
at december   we had no balances outstanding on our million unsecured line of credit 
however  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  leaving approximately million available under our unsecured line of credit 
as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit  from time to time  we may borrow using an unsecured overnight borrowing facility 
our use of short term borrowings does not decrease the amount available under our unsecured line of credit 
we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec which allows us to offer  from time to time  an unlimited amount of common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  or warrants 
on may   the shareholders of the company approved an amendment to our amended and restated declaration of trust to increase our total number of authorized shares from million to million shares of beneficial interest  consisting of million common shares and million preferred shares 
in may  we created an atm program through which we can  but have no obligation to  sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million the atm program  in amounts and at times as we determine  into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions 
actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors  including  among others  market conditions  the trading price of our common shares  and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the atm program for general corporate purposes  which may include funding for development activities  financing for acquisitions  the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities  reducing future borrowings under our million unsecured line of credit  and the repayment of other indebtedness 
as of the date of this filing  we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million remaining available for sale under the atm program 
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody s  fitch  and standard and poors  which are currently baa  bbb and bbb  respectively  with stable  stable and positive outlooks  respectively  as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks  fannie mae  freddie mac  or life insurance companies 
however  we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt  including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit 
during  approximately million of debt  including scheduled principal amortizations of approximately million  is scheduled to mature 
in january  we repaid a million secured third party note payable which was scheduled to mature in april see note  notes payable  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

table of contents we intend to incur approximately million of additional expected costs to complete our consolidated communities under construction 
of this amount  we expect approximately million will be incurred during and the remainder of the costs to be incurred during additionally  we also expect to incur between approximately million and million of additional redevelopment expenditures and million and million of additional other capital expenditures during we intend to meet our near term liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operations  available cash balances  draws on our unsecured credit facility  and proceeds from property dispositions 
we continually evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities develop 
we also intend to meet our near term liquidity requirements through equity issued from our atm program  the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement and secured mortgages 
in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
in december  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of per share to our common shareholders of record as of december  the dividend was subsequently paid on january  we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units 
when aggregated with previous dividends  this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of per share or unit for the year ended december  in the first quarter of  the company board of trust managers increased the quarterly dividend rate from to per common share 
future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations  the company financial condition and capital requirements  distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers 
assuming dividend distributions for the remainder of are similar to those declared for the first quarter  the annualized dividend rate for would be 
the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions total thereafter debt maturities interest payments non cancelable lease payments postretirement benefit obligations includes scheduled principal amortizations 
includes contractual interest payments for our senior unsecured notes and secured notes 
the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december  or the most recent practicable date 
off balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured  third party debt 
as of december   we have no outstanding guarantees related to loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months 
in an inflationary environment  we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases 
we believe the short term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents use of estimates 
in the application of gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  results of operations during the reporting periods  and related disclosures 
our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets  and estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
principles of consolidation 
we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
investments acquired or created are continuously evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities vies  which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
if the investment is determined not to be a vie  then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities 
if we are the general partner in a limited partnership  or manager of a limited liability company  we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners non managing members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined by gaap with respect to our investments occurs 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
accordingly  we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 
asset impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows  trends  strategic decisions regarding future development plans  and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist 
when impairment exists  the long lived asset is adjusted to its fair value 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding a number of factors  including market rents  economic conditions  and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates 
in estimating fair value  management uses appraisals  management estimates  and discounted cash flow calculations which maximize inputs from a marketplace participant s perspective 
in addition  we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value  we will record an impairment charge 
the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions  including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities 
we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses 
due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses  it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets  properties under development  and land is currently recoverable 
however  if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates  we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets 
any such material non cash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
cost capitalization 
real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges 
carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development 
capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt 
expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties  are also capitalized 
we begin capitalizing development  construction  and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities necessary to get the underlying real estate asset ready for its intended use have been initiated 
all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion of the apartment homes  the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land  respectively 
included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
the estimates used by management require judgment  and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and december  december  amount in millions weighted average maturity in years weighted average interest rate of total amount in millions weighted average maturity in years weighted average interest rate of total fixed rate debt variable rate debt we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline 
to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility and increase our variable rate indebtedness  our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant  a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
we have entered into  and may enter into in the future  interest rate swaps and caps to protect ourselves against fluctuations in the rates of our floating rate debt 
in connection with the repayment of the million loan in june  we discontinued the hedging relationship on the million interest rate swap on may  upon repayment of the loan  which eliminated the probable future variable monthly interest payments being hedged  we recognized a non cash charge of approximately million which included the accelerated reclassification of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this swap 
this interest rate swap matured in october and settled 
the changes in fair value of this swap were marked to market through earnings in other income and other expense 
during  we recorded a net loss of approximately million related to this derivative instrument through the settlement date
