core technologies overview intricon serves the body worn device market by designing  developing  engineering and manufacturing micro miniature products  microelectronics  micro mechanical assemblies and complete assemblies  primarily for bio telemetry devices  hearing instruments and professional audio communication devices 
over the past several years  the company has increased investments in the continued development of four critical core technologies ultra low power ulp digital signal processing dsp  ultra low power wireless  microminiaturization  and miniature transducers 
these four core technologies serve as the foundation of current and future product platform development  designed to meet the rising demand for smaller  portable more advanced devices 
the continued advancements in this area have allowed the company to further enhance the mobility and effectiveness of miniature body worn devices 
ultra low power digital signal processing dsp converts real world analog signals into a digital format 
through our nanodsp technology  intricon offers an extensive range of ulp dsp amplifiers for hearing  medical and professional audio applications 
our proprietary nanodsp incorporates advanced ultra miniature hardware with sophisticated signal processing algorithms to produce devices that are smaller and more effective 
during the company further expanded its dsp portfolio including improvements to its reliant clear feedback canceller  offering increased added stable gain and faster reaction time 
additionally  newly developed dsp technologies are utilized in the sirona cardiac diagnostic monitoring cdm platform 
ultra low power wireless wireless connectivity is fast becoming a required technology  and wireless capabilities are especially critical in new body worn devices 
intricon s bodynet ulp technology  including the nanolink and physiolink wireless systems  offers solutions for transmitting the body s activities to caregivers  and wireless audio links for professional communications and surveillance products 
potential bodynet applications include electrocardiogram ecg diagnostics and monitoring  diabetes monitoring  sleep apnea studies and audio streaming for hearing devices 
intricon is in the final stages of commercializing its physiolink wireless technology  which will be incorporated into product platforms serving the medical  hearing health and professional audio communication markets 
this system is based on ghz proprietary digital radio protocol in the industrial scientific medical ism frequency band and enables audio and data streaming to ear worn and body worn applications over distances of up to five meters 
microminiaturization intricon excels at miniaturizing body worn devices 
we began honing our microminiaturization skills over years ago  supplying components to the hearing health industry 
our core miniaturization technology allows us to make devices for our markets that are one cubic inch and smaller 
we also are specialists in devices that run on very low power  as evidenced by our ulp wireless and dsp 
less power means a smaller battery  which enables us to reduce size even further  and develop devices that fit into the palm of one s hand 
miniature transducers intricon s advanced microphone and receiver technology has been pushing the limits of size and performance for over a decade 
our miniature transducers  which have been incorporated into various product platforms  enhance the reliability  sensitivity  supply voltage  and output level in body worn devices 
these enhancements allow us to make devices that are extremely portable and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments 
these small devices are well suited for applications in the aviation  fire  law enforcement  safety and military markets 
our technology also is used for technical surveillance by law enforcement and security agencies  and by performers and production staff in the music and stage performance markets 
also included in our transducer line are medical coils and micro coils used in pacemaker programming and interventional catheter positioning applications 

table of contents market overview our core technologies expertise is focused on three main markets medical bio telemetry  value hearing health and professional audio communications 
revenue from the medical bio telemetry and value hearing health markets is reported on the respective medical and hearing health lines in the discussion of our results of operation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note revenue by market to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
medical bio telemetry in the medical bio telemetry market  the company is focused on sales of bio telemetry devices for life critical diagnostic monitoring 
using our nanodsp and bodynet technology platforms  the company manufactures microelectronics  micro mechanical assemblies  high precision injection molded plastic components and complete bio telemetry devices for emerging and leading medical device manufacturers 
the medical industry is faced with pressures to reduce the cost of healthcare 
driven by core technologies  such as the intricon physiolink that wirelessly connects patients and care givers in non traditional ways  intricon helps shift the point of care from expensive traditional settings  such as hospitals  to less expensive non traditional settings like the home 
intricon currently serves this market by offering medical manufacturers the capabilities to design  develop and manufacture medical devices that are easier to use  are more miniature  use less power  and are lighter 
increasingly  the medical industry is looking for wireless  low power capabilities in their devices 
we have a strategic partnership with advanced medical electronics corp 
ame that allows us to develop new bio telemetry devices that better connect patients and care givers  providing critical information and feedback 
through the further development of our ulp bodynet family  we believe the bio telemetry markets offers significant opportunity 
intricon currently has a strong presence in both the diabetes and cardiac diagnostic monitoring bio telemetry markets 
for diabetes  intricon has partnered with medtronic to manufacture their wireless continuous glucose monitors that measure glucose levels and deliver real time blood glucose trend information 
along with the wireless glucose monitor  intricon also manufactures a variety of related accessories 
further  we believe there are opportunities to expand our diabetes product offering with medtronic as well as move into new markets 
in the cardiac diagnostic monitoring market  we provide solutions for ambulatory cardiac monitoring 
we entered this market through an acquisition of jon barron  inc doing business as datrix datrix in our first two product platforms  sirona and centauri  received food and drug administration fda k approval in late the sirona platform  which incorporates the physiolink technology  is essentially two products in one design because it can be used as an event recorder  a holter monitor or both 
this platform is very small  rechargeable  and water spray proof 
the features of the centauri platform are event recording combined with wireless transmission of the patient data to a remote service center  which then forwards the information to the doctor 
in addition  intricon manufactures and supplies bubble sensors and flow restrictors that monitor and control the flow of fluid in an intravenous infusion system 
intricon also manufactures a family of safety needle products for an original equipment manufacturing oem customer that utilizes intricon s insert and straight molding capabilities 
these products are assembled using full automation  including built in quality checks within the production lines 
intricon is targeting other emerging biotelemetry and home care markets  such as sleep apnea  that could benefit from its capabilities to develop devices that are more technologically advanced  smaller and lightweight 
to do so  intricon is focusing more capital and resources in sales and marketing to expand its reach to other large medical device and health care companies 
value hearing health market the company believes the value hearing health market offers significant growth opportunities 
in the united states alone  there are approximately million hearing impaired individuals 
this population is expected to grow significantly over the next ten years as year old plus age demographic is one of the fastest growing segments the in the us  europe and japan 
the current us market penetration into the hearing impaired population is approximately percent 
we believe the us market penetration is low primarily due to high costs to purchase a hearing device and inconveniences in the conventional hearing health distribution channel 
this has created the opportunity for alternative care models  such the insurance channel and personal sound amplifier psap channel 
in the insurance channel  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement with hi healthinnovations  a unitedhealth group company  to become their supplier of hearing aids 
at the beginning of hi healthinnovations launched a suite of high tech  lower cost hearing devices for their medicare and part d participants and later in the year announced they were increasing this offering to the over million people enrolled in their employer sponsored and individual health benefit plans 
this insurance model has been successfully demonstrated internationally  as several countries providing a full insurance program are serving to percent of hearing impaired population 
further  research in the us has shown a fully insured model will drive an individual to seek treatment at an earlier stage of hearing loss  greatly increasing the market size and penetration 
in personal sound amplifier products  the fda has created a psap category  it is analogous to reader glasses in the optical market and provides a cost effective sound amplification device 
these devices are not hearing aids and make no claims of compensating for hearing loss 
they can be purchased off the shelf and are not fit or prescribed to meet a specific individual s needs 
rather  these devices amplify sound and tend to be used in noisy or challenging environments 
they have a significantly lower retail price to the consumer than traditional hearing aids 

table of contents we also believe there are niches in the conventional hearing health channel that will embrace our value hearing health proposition  as high costs constrain their growth potential 
additionally  we believe there is a large international market  most notably in the so called bric countries brazil  russia  india and china  for this type of product offering 
we believe intricon is very well positioned to serve these value hearing health market channels 
over the past several years the company has invested heavily in core technologies  product platforms and its global manufacturing capabilities geared to provide high tech  lower cost hearing devices 
our dsp devices provide better clarity and an improved ability to filter out background noise at attractive pricing points 
we believe product platform introductions such as the apt and lumen devices will drive market share gains into all channels of the emerging value hearing health market 
professional audio communications intricon entered the high quality audio communication device market in  and now has a line of miniature  professional audio headset products used by customers focusing on homeland security and emergency response needs 
the line includes several communication devices that are extremely portable and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments 
these products are well suited for applications in the fire  law enforcement  safety  aviation and military markets 
in addition  the company has a line of miniature ear and head worn devices used by performers and support staff in the music and stage performance markets 
the company also serves us government security agencies and the singapore government in this market 
we believe performance in difficult listening environments and wireless operations will continue to improve as these products increasingly include our proprietary nanodsp  wireless nanolink and physiolink technologies 
the company sees great opportunity to market its situational listening devices sld s 
much like the psap devices  these devices are intended to help people hear in noisy environments like restaurants and automobiles  and listen to television  music  and direct broadcast by wireless connection 
such devices are intended to be supplements to conventional hearing aids  which do not handle those situations well 
the sld s will be based on our physiolink technology  which were recently demonstrated at the annual convention of the american academy of audiology 
the product line consists of an earpiece  tv transmitter  companion microphone  ipod iphone transmitter  and usb transmitter 
with the emergence of advanced parallel technologies in both the sld and psap markets  the company will likely shift recognition of many professional audio communications product sales into the value hearing health market in future years 
for information concerning our net sales  net income and assets  see the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
marketing and competition 
intricon intends to focus more capital and resources in marketing and sales to expand its reach into large medical device and healthcare companies in the medical bio telemetry and value hearing health markets outlined above 
the company believes this will allow us to further advance our technology portfolio  new product platforms  strengthen customer relations and expand our market knowledge 
currently  intricon sells its hearing instrument components directly to domestic hearing instrument manufacturers and distributors through an internal sales force 
sales of medical and professional audio communications products are also made primarily through an internal sales force 
in recent years  a small number of companies have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s sales 
in  one customer accounted for approximately percent of the company s net sales 
during  the top five customers accounted for approximately  or percent  of the company s net sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of net sales and long lived assets by geographic area 
internationally  sales representatives employed by intricon gmbh gmbh  a wholly owned german subsidiary  solicit sales from european hearing instrument  medical device and professional audio communications manufacturers and suppliers 
intricon believes that it is the largest supplier worldwide of micro miniature electromechanical components to hearing instrument manufacturers and that its full product line  automated manufacturing process and low cost manufacturing capabilities in asia  allow it to compete effectively with other manufacturers within this market 
in the market of hybrid amplifiers and molded plastic faceplates  hearing instrument manufacturers produce a substantial portion of their internal needs for these components 
intricon markets its high performance microphone products to the radio communication and professional audio industries and has several larger competitors who have greater financial resources 
intricon holds a small market share in the global market for microphone capsules and other related products 
employees 
as of december   the company had a total of full time equivalent employees  of whom are executive and administrative personnel  are sales personnel  are engineering personnel and are operations personnel 
the company considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 
none of the company s employees are represented by a union 

table of contents as a supplier of parts for consumer and medical products  intricon is subject to claims for personal injuries allegedly caused by its products 
the company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage 
research and development 
intricon conducts research and development activities primarily to improve its existing products and proprietary technology 
the company is committed to increasing its investment in the research and development of proprietary technologies  such as the ulp nanodsp and ulp wireless technologies 
the company believes the continued development of key proprietary technologies will be the catalyst for long term revenues and margin growth 
research and development expenditures were   and  in  and  respectively 
these amounts are net of customer and grant reimbursed research and development 
intricon owns a number of united states patents which cover a number of product designs and processes 
although the company believes that these patents collectively add value to the company  the costs associated with the submission of patent applications are expensed as incurred given the uncertainty of the patents providing future economic benefit to the company 
regulation 
a large portion of our business operates in a marketplace subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the design control  development  manufacturing  labeling  record keeping  and surveillance procedures for medical devices 
united states food and drug administration fda regulations classify medical devices based on perceived risk to public health as either class i  ii or iii devices 
class i devices are subject to general controls  class ii devices are subject to special controls and class iii devices are subject to pre market approval pma requirements 
while most class i devices are exempt from pre market submission  it is necessary for most class ii devices to be cleared by a k pre market notification prior to marketing 
k establishes that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device which was legally marketed prior to may  or which itself has been found to be substantially equivalent  through the k process  after may  it is substantially equivalent if it has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate 
the k pre market notification must be supported by data establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the fda 
the process of obtaining a k clearance typically can take several months to a year or longer 
if the product is notably new or different and substantial equivalence cannot be established  the fda will require the manufacturer to submit a pma application for a class iii device that must be reviewed and approved by the fda prior to sale and marketing of the device in the united states 
the process of obtaining pma approval can be expensive  uncertain  lengthy and frequently requires anywhere from one to several years from the date of fda submission  if approval is obtained at all 
the fda controls the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and strictly prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses 
the fda can withdraw products from the market for failure to comply with laws or the occurrence of safety risks 
all of our current hearing aid devices are air conduction devices and  as such  are class i medical devices  exempt from the k submission process 
they are typically marketed to fda approved manufacturers with intricon assisting in the design  development and production 
our ecg recorder devices are classified as class ii medical devices and have received k clearance from the fda 
our manufacturing operations are subject to periodic inspections by the fda  whose primary purpose is to audit the company s compliance with the quality system regulations published by the fda and other applicable government standards 
strict regulatory action may be initiated in response to audit deficiencies or to product performance problems 
we believe that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the requirements of the fda regulations and this has been substantiated with no findings cited during our most recent fda audit in april of recent concerns have been raised by the public  internal fda staff and congress as to whether the current fda k program achieves its goals of making safe and effective devices available to the public while also fostering innovation 
in august  the fda center for devices and radiological health cdrh released two major fda reports recommending changes to be taken by cdrh 
the first report provides recommendations on how to strengthen the k program and the second report provided recommendations on how to incorporate new scientific information into regulatory decision making 
the recommendations were adopted in and are not anticipated to have a significant impact on the company 
international regulation international regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards  packaging and labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax 
many of these regulations are similar to those of the fda 
we believe we are in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the foreign countries in which our medical devices are marketed 
the registration system for our medical devices in the eu requires that our quality system conform to international quality standards and that our medical devices conform to essential requirements set forth by the medical device directive mdd 
manufacturing facilities and processes under which our ecg recorder devices are produced are inspected and audited by our international organization for standardization iso registrar british standards institute bsi 
our authorized representative  ce partner u  maintains our technical file and registers our products with competent authorities in all eu member states 
manufacturing facilities and processes under which all of our other medical devices are produced are inspected and audited annually by the bsi 
these audits verify our compliance with the essential requirements of the mdd 
these certifying bodies verify that our quality system conforms to the international quality standard iso and that our products conform to the essential requirements and supplementary requirements set forth by the mdd for the class of medical devices we produce 
these certifying bodies also certify our conformity with both the quality standards and the mdd requirements  entitling us to place the ce mark on all of our ecg recorder devices 
our hearing aid devices typically bear the ce mark of our customers who assume regulatory responsibilities for those devices 

table of contents third party reimbursement the availability and level of reimbursement from third party payers for procedures utilizing our products is significant to our business 
our products are purchased primarily by oem customers who sell into clinics  hospitals and other end users  who in turn bill various third party payers for the services provided to the patients 
these payers  which include medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans and managed care organizations  reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures utilizing our products 
in response to the national focus on rising health care costs  a number of changes to reduce costs have been proposed or have begun to emerge 
there have been  and may continue to be  proposals by legislators  regulators and third party payers to curb these costs 
the development or increased use of more cost effective treatments for diseases could cause such payers to decrease or deny reimbursement for surgeries or devices to favor alternatives that do not utilize our products 
a significant number of americans enroll in some form of managed care plan 
higher managed care utilization typically drives down the payments for health care procedures  which in turn places pressure on medical supply prices 
this causes hospitals to implement tighter vendor selection and certification processes  by reducing the number of vendors used  purchasing more products from fewer vendors and trading discounts on price for guaranteed higher volumes to vendors 
hospitals have also sought to control and reduce costs over the last decade by joining group purchasing organizations or purchasing alliances 
we cannot predict what continuing or future impact these practices  the existing or proposed legislation  or such third party payer measures within a constantly changing healthcare landscape may have on our future business  financial condition or results of operations

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
if any of the risks events actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of future operations could be materially adversely affected 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations  which could adversely affect us 
factors that affect our results of operations include  but are not limited to  the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the global economy and financial markets  changes in the mix of products sold  market acceptance of our products and our customer s products  competitive pricing pressures  global currency valuations  the availability of electronic components that we purchase from suppliers  our ability to meet demand  our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors  changing customer requirements  delays in new product qualifications  and the timing and extent of research and development expenses 
these factors have caused and may continue to cause us to experience fluctuations in operating results on a quarterly and or annual basis 
these fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  which in turn  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are dependent on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues 
in fiscal year  our largest customer accounted for approximately percent of our net sales and our five largest customers accounted for approximately percent of our net sales 
a significant decrease in the sales to or loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of customers to develop and sell products that incorporate our products 
no assurance can be given that our major customers will not experience financial  technical or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and  in turn  our results of operations 
we may not be able to collect outstanding accounts receivable from our customers 
some of our customers purchase our products on credit  which may cause a concentration of accounts receivable among some of our customers 
as of december   we had accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  of  which represented approximately percent of our shareholders equity as of that date 
as of that date  two customers accounted for a combined total of percent of our accounts receivable 
our financial condition and profitability may be harmed if one or more of our customers are unable or unwilling to pay these accounts receivable when due 
there are risks under our manufacturing agreement with hi healthinnovations 
in  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with hi healthinnovations  a unitedhealth group company  to supply hearing aids 
under the agreement  we are required to establish and maintain a certain level of manufacturing  supply chain and delivery capacity 
we devoted considerable time  resources and capital during and securing the agreement and preparing for the program s launch 
hi healthinnovations is not required to purchase any minimum amount under the manufacturing agreement and may cease purchases at any time 
we also agreed that during the term of the agreement  we would not sell hearing aids or accessories to another health insurer or directly to consumers 
for more information  see our current report on form k filed with the sec on november  royalties under the sale of our interest in the global coils joint venture may be less than estimated 
in august  the company sold its interest in its global coils joint venture  to its joint venture partner audemars sa 
the consideration for the sale included cash  inventory and royalty payments 
included in the gain on sale are the estimated royalty payments which the company measured at fair value based on level inputs which are considered unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
the company used future estimated cash flows discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
actual royalty payments may differ from the company s estimate which could adversely affect the company s results of operations in future periods 

table of contents despite signs of improvement in economic conditions  the current domestic economic environment could cause a severe disruption in our operations 
our business has been negatively impacted by the recent domestic economic environment 
if the economy does not continue to improve or worsens  there could be several severely negative implications to our business that may exacerbate many of the risk factors we identified including  but not limited to  the following liquidity the domestic economic environment and the associated credit crisis could worsen and reduce liquidity and this could have a negative impact on financial institutions and the country s financial system  which could  in turn  have a negative impact on our business 
we may not be able to borrow additional funds under our existing credit facility and may not be able to expand our existing facility if our lender becomes insolvent or its liquidity is limited or impaired or if we fail to meet covenant levels going forward 
in addition  we may not be able to renew our existing credit facility at the conclusion of its current term or renew it on terms that are favorable to us 
demand any deterioration in the economy or a return to recession could result in lower sales to our customers 
additionally  our customers may not have access to sufficient cash or short term credit to obtain our products or services 
prices certain markets could experience deflation  which would negatively impact our average prices and reduce our margins 
our operations could be adversely affected by changes in the federal budget 
the federal government is under increasing pressure to reduce the budget deficit 
this could result in a general reduction in us healthcare and defense spending and could cause our customers to delay  reduce or cancel their purchases of our products 
future actions or inactions of the united states government  including a failure to increase the government debt limit  reductions in the size of the u 
s budget  including automatic across the board budget cuts  or sequestrations  reductions in the medicare and medicaid programs  potential tax increases or a temporary shutdown of the federal government  could affect purchases by our customers  disrupt financial markets and adversely affect economic conditions generally  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
health care policy changes  including us health care reform legislation signed in  may have a material adverse effect on us 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of the legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a excise tax on all us medical device sales beginning in january under the legislation  the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately billion over ten years 
this significant increase in the tax burden on our industry could have a material  negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows either directly  through taxes on us  or indirectly through others in our value chain being subject to the tax 
we currently estimate the direct impact of the excise tax on us to be minimal  however  if facts or circumstances change in our business relationships  we could be subject to customer pricing pressures or required to pay additional taxes under the rules 
other elements of this legislation  such as comparative effectiveness research  an independent payment advisory board  payment system reforms  including shared savings pilots  and other provisions  could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered  and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business 
if we are unable to continue to develop new products that are inexpensive to manufacture  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to continue to achieve our historical profit margins due to advancements in technology 
the ability to continue our profit margins is dependent upon our ability to stay competitive by developing products that are technologically advanced and inexpensive to manufacture 
our need for continued investment in research and development may increase expenses and reduce our profitability 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the need to maintain or increase spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development  our operating results could be materially harmed if our research and development efforts fail to result in new products or if revenues fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our commitment to invest in research and development  management believes that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues could increase in the future 
we operate in a highly competitive business and if we are unable to be competitive  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
several of our competitors have been able to offer more standardized and less technologically advanced hearing and professional audio communication products at lower prices 
price competition has had an adverse effect on our sales and margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance our technical capabilities or compete successfully with our existing and future competitors 

table of contents merger and acquisition activity in our hearing health market has resulted in a smaller customer base 
reliance on fewer customers may have an adverse effect on us 
several of our customers in the hearing health market have undergone mergers or acquisitions  resulting in a smaller customer base with larger customers 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with the reduced customer base  it may adversely affect our operating profits and revenue 
unfavorable legislation in the hearing health market may decrease the demand for our products  and may negatively impact our financial condition 
in some of our foreign markets  government subsidies cover a portion of the cost of hearing aids 
a change in legislation that would reduce or eliminate these subsidies could decrease the demand for our hearing health products 
this could result in an adverse effect on our operating results 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of any such legislation 
our failure to obtain required governmental approvals and maintain regulatory compliance for our required products would impact our ability to generate revenue from those products 
the markets in which our business operates are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the design control  development  manufacturing  labeling  record keeping  and surveillance procedures for our medical devices 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance or approvals from the fda for new products and new applications for existing products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearance approvals will be granted  or that the fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect our ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products 
some of our products in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre market approval process with the fda 
the fda has the authority to control the indicated uses of a device 
products can also be withdrawn from the market due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems 
the fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect us 
the registration system for our medical devices in the eu requires that our quality system conform to international quality standards 
manufacturing facilities and processes under which our ecg recorder devices are produced are inspected and audited by various certifying bodies 
these audits verify our compliance with applicable requirements and standards 
further  the fda  various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect our facilities to determine whether we are in compliance with various regulations relating to quality systems  such as manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control  product labeling and product surveillance 
a determination that we are in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recalls or product seizures  suspensions or shutdown of production and  in extreme cases  criminal sanctions  depending on the nature of the violation 
implementation of our growth strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase revenues 
our growth strategy includes developing new products and entering new markets  as well as identifying and integrating acquisitions 
our ability to compete in new markets will depend upon a number of factors including  among others our ability to create demand for products in new markets  our ability to manage growth effectively  our ability to strengthen our sales and marketing presence  our ability to successfully identify  complete and integrate acquisitions  our ability to respond to changes in our customers businesses by updating existing products and introducing  in a timely fashion  new products which meet the needs of our customers  the quality of our new products  and our ability to respond rapidly to technological change 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may face competition in these new markets from various companies that may have substantially greater research and development resources  marketing and financial resources  manufacturing capability and customer support organizations 

table of contents we have foreign operations in singapore  indonesia and germany  and various factors relating to our international operations could affect our results of operations 
in  we operated in singapore  indonesia and germany 
approximately percent of our revenues were derived from our facilities in these countries in as of december  approximately percent of our long lived assets are located in these countries 
political or economic instability in these countries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to diminished revenues in these countries 
our future revenues  costs of operations and profit results could be affected by a number of factors related to our international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in economic conditions from country to country  changes in a country s political condition  trade protection measures  licensing and other legal requirements and local tax issues 
unanticipated currency fluctuations in the euro  singapore dollar and other currencies could lead to lower reported consolidated revenues due to the translation of this currency into us dollars when we consolidate our revenues and results from operations 
the recent recessions in europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies 
the continuing debt crisis in certain european countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate  reducing the purchasing power of our european customers 
financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers  including distributors  could result in product delays and inventory issues  risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 
also  the effect of the debt crisis in certain european countries could have an adverse effect on the capital markets generally  specifically impacting our ability and the ability of our customers to finance our and their respective businesses on acceptable terms  if at all  the availability of materials and supplies and demand for our products 
we may explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business 
we may not be able to complete these transactions and these transactions  if executed  pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement  enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities 
we may have difficulty finding these opportunities or  if we do identify these opportunities  we may not be able to complete the transactions for various reasons  including a failure to secure financing 
any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks  including the diversion of our management s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture  possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process  unanticipated liabilities  and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate  operate  maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt 
we may experience difficulty in paying our debt when it comes due  which could limit our ability to obtain financing 
as of december   we had bank indebtedness of  and additional indebtedness of payable to the former shareholder of datrix 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by general economic conditions and by financial  competitive  political  business and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that availability under our existing credit facility combined with funds expected to be generated from operations and control of capital spending will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operating needs for at least the next months 
if  however  we are unable to renew these facilities or obtain waivers see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in the future or do not generate sufficient cash or complete such financings on a timely basis  we may be required to seek additional financing or sell equity on terms which may not be as favorable as we could have otherwise obtained 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing  additional borrowing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and equity capital markets  as well as our own financial condition and performance 
if we fail to meet our financial and other covenants under our loan agreements with our lenders  absent a waiver  we will be in default of the loan agreements and our lenders can take actions that would adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants in our loan agreements 
in the event we are unable to comply with these covenants during future periods  it is uncertain whether our lenders will grant waivers for our non compliance 
if there is an event of default by us under our loan agreements  our lenders have the option to  among other things  accelerate any and all of our obligations under the loan agreements which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our success depends on our senior management team and if we are not able to retain them  it could have a materially adverse effect on us

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations  result in the loss of critical and confidential information  and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 
global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats 
while we employ comprehensive measures to prevent  detect  address and mitigate these threats including access controls  vulnerability assessments  continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems  cybersecurity incidents  depending on their nature and scope  could potentially result in the misappropriation  destruction  corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations 
the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage  litigation with third parties  diminution in the value of our investment in research  development and engineering  and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs  which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our engineering and technical personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in our markets 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development and growth of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
the failure to retain and recruit key technical personnel could cause additional expense  potentially reduce the efficiency of our operations and could harm our business 
we and or our customers may be unable to protect our and their proprietary technology and intellectual property rights or keep up with that of competitors 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our markets depends  in part  on our ability and the ability of our customers to protect our and their current and future proprietary technology under patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and unfair competition laws 
we cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate  or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around the proprietary rights we own or license 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs in attempting to protect our proprietary rights 
also  despite the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our and our customers products  develop similar technology independently or otherwise obtain and use information that we or our customers regard as proprietary 
we and our customers may be unable to successfully identify or prosecute unauthorized uses of our or our customers technology 
if we become subject to material intellectual property infringement claims  we could incur significant expenses and could be prevented from selling specific products 
we may become subject to material claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others in the future 
we cannot assure that  if made  these claims will not be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management from other business 
any judgment against us could require substantial payment in damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain products 
environmental liability and compliance obligations may affect our operations and results 
our manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations as well as internal programs and policies governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the storage  use  handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and chemicals  and employee health and safety 

table of contents if violations of environmental laws occur  we could be held liable for damages  penalties  fines and remedial actions 
our operations and results could be adversely affected by any material obligations arising from existing laws  as well as any required material modifications arising from new regulations that may be enacted in the future 
we may also be held liable for past disposal of hazardous substances generated by our business or former businesses or businesses we acquire 
in addition  it is possible that we may be held liable for contamination discovered at our present or former facilities 
we are subject to numerous asbestos related lawsuits  which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we are a defendant along with a number of other parties in lawsuits alleging that plaintiffs have or may have contracted asbestos related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos products or equipment containing asbestos sold by one or more named defendants 
these lawsuits relate to the discontinued heat technologies segment which we sold in march due to the non informative nature of the complaints  we do not know whether any of the complaints state valid claims against us 
certain insurance carriers have informed us that the primary policies for the period august  have been exhausted and that the carriers will no longer provide defense and insurance coverage under those policies 
however  we have other primary and excess insurance policies that we believe afford coverage for later years 
some of these other primary insurers have accepted defense and insurance coverage for these suits  and some of them have either ignored our tender of defense of these cases  or have denied coverage  or have accepted the tenders but asserted a reservation of rights and or advised us that they need to investigate further 
because settlement payments are applied to all years a litigant was deemed to have been exposed to asbestos  we believe we will have funds available for defense and insurance coverage under the non exhausted primary and excess insurance policies 
however  unlike the older policies  the more recent policies have deductible amounts for defense and settlements costs that we will be required to pay  accordingly  we expect that our litigation costs will increase in the future as the older policies are exhausted 
further  many of the policies covering later years approximately and thereafter have exclusions for any asbestos products or operations  and thus do not provide insurance coverage for asbestos related lawsuits 
if our insurance policies do not cover the costs and any awards for the asbestos related lawsuits  we will have to use our cash or obtain additional financing to pay the asbestos related obligations and settlement costs 
there is no assurance that we will have the cash or be able to obtain additional financings on favorable terms to pay asbestos related obligations or settlements should they occur 
the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty 
in light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos lawsuits  there is no guarantee that these lawsuits will not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and there has been limited trading volume in our stock  which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell common stock when they want to and at prices they find attractive 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile  and there has been limited trading volume in our common stock 
the common stock market price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors operating results  the timing and announcement of sales or acquisitions of assets by us or our competitors  changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  adverse or unfavorable publicity about our products  technologies or us  the commencement of material litigation  or an unfavorable verdict  against us  terrorist attacks  war and threats of attacks and war  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
such volatility has affected many companies irrespective of  or disproportionately to  the operating performance of these companies 
these broad fluctuations and limited trading volume may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and your ability to sell our common stock 
most of our outstanding shares are available for resale in the public market without restriction 
the sale of a large number of these shares could adversely affect the share price and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or make acquisitions for common stock 
anti takeover provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control would be beneficial to shareholders 
we are a pennsylvania corporation 
anti takeover provisions in pennsylvania law and our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold 
for example  our charter provides that the board of directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 
in addition  our bylaws provide for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term 
directors may be removed by shareholders only with the approval of the holders of at least two thirds of all of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote

for more information  see our current report on form k filed with the sec on november  if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business  the trading price of our stock and our ability to retain our current customers or obtain new customers 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  referred to as section  we are required to include in our annual reports on form k  our management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
currently  we are not required to include a report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal controls because we are a smaller reporting company under sec rules  therefore  shareholders do not have the benefit of an independent review of our internal controls 
while we have reported no material weaknesses in the form k for the fiscal year ended december   we cannot guarantee that we will not have material weaknesses reported by our management in the future 
compliance with the requirements of section is expensive and time consuming 
if in the future we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner  or if we determine that we have a material weakness  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  any failure to establish an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential investors and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the securities exchange act of  which could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock

table of contents results of operations compared with consolidated net sales our net sales are comprised of three main markets medical  hearing health  and professional audio collectively our body worn device segment 
below is a recap of our sales by main markets for the years ended december  and change dollars percent medical hearing health professional audio communications consolidated net sales in  we experienced a percent increase in medical sales primarily driven by higher sales to medtronic and other key medical customers 
management believes the industry wide trend to shift the point of care from expensive traditional settings  such as hospitals  to less expensive non traditional settings like the home  will result in growth of the medical bio telemetry industry 
intricon currently serves this market by offering medical manufacturers the capabilities to design  develop and manufacture medical devices that are easier to use  are more miniature  use less power  and are lighter 
intricon has a strong presence in both the diabetes market  with its medtronic partnership  and cardiac diagnostic monitoring bio telemetry market 
the company believes there are growth opportunities in these markets as well other emerging biotelemetry and home care markets  such as sleep apnea  that could benefit from its capabilities to develop devices that are more technologically advanced  smaller and lightweight 
net sales in our hearing health business for the year ended december  increased percent over the same period in driven by sales to hi healthinnovations and sales into the nontraditional psap hearing health market 
these gains were partially offset by temporary declines in legacy products 
in mid  we satisfied hi healthinnovations initial product ramp up needs for and in the near term we expect minimal new orders 
the hi healthinnovations program is based on a development of an innovative new distribution channel 
while hi healthinnovations continues to make progress  there are challenges to be overcome and it is difficult to project program needs at this time  however  we do believe in the long term potential of this program 
we continue to support hi healthinnovations in building the infrastructure to provide high quality  affordable hearing healthcare to their customers 
examples of our efforts include the development and validation of hardware and software  providing quality management system support  and device tracking and analysis support 
we believe this will position hi healthinnovations to aggressively expand this program to their customer base 
with market dynamics such as low penetration rates  an aging population  and the need for reduced cost and convenience  the company believes the hearing health market offers significant growth opportunities  including the emergence of alternative care models  such the insurance channel and psap channel 
intricon believes it is very well positioned to serve these value hearing health market channels 
over the past several years the company has invested heavily in core technologies  product platforms and its global manufacturing capabilities geared to provide high tech  lower cost hearing devices 
our dsp devices provide better clarity and an improved ability to filter out background noise at attractive pricing points 
we believe product platform introductions such as the apt and lumen devices will drive market share gains into all channels of the emerging value hearing health market 
net sales to the professional audio device sector increased percent in compared to the same period in the significant increase over the prior year was due to continued demand for securities products domestically and to the fulfillment of a large headset contract with the singapore government  providing technically advanced headsets to be worn in difficult listening environments 
while the singapore government contract has been fulfilled in  we believe there is potential for additional future contracts with the singapore government and other agencies 
additionally  we believe our extensive portfolio of communication devices that are portable  smaller and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments will provide for future long term growth in this market 
gross profit gross profit  both in dollars and as a percent of sales  for and  were as follows change dollars percent of sales dollars percent of sales dollars percent gross profit in  gross profit increased primarily due to greater sales across our three core markets  partially offset by infrastructure costs in asia and an unfavorable product mix in our professional audio communications market 
the company further expanded its low cost manufacturing capabilities during the year 
the continued ramp up of the company s indonesian facility provides low cost manufacturing options to drive ongoing margin improvement and the ability to pursue additional high volume manufacturing opportunities 
in addition  the company increased the medical manufacturing infrastructure at its singapore facility to support the transfer of certain medical business 
the company has a number of initiatives to expand margins  including transferring select labor intensive programs to singapore and indonesia  and increasing the percentage of proprietary intricon technology into all of its product platforms 
however  due to the relatively fixed global cost manufacturing structure  the most immediate impact on margin growth will be through increased revenue volume 

table of contents sales and marketing  general and administrative and research and development expenses sales and marketing  general and administrative and research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were change dollars percent of sales dollars percent of sales dollars percent sales and marketing general and administrative research and development sales and marketing increased over the prior year due to increased sales and related selling commissions and a headcount addition in late management expects to focus more capital and resources in sales and marketing in the upcoming years to expand its reach in the medical bio telemetry and value hearing health markets

new accounting pronouncements see new accounting pronouncements set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k  for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
certain accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their importance to the consolidated financial statements and possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly 
the accounting policies of the company with significant estimates and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the customer takes ownership  primarily upon product shipment  and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 

table of contents customers have days to notify the company if the product is damaged or defective 
beyond that  there are no significant obligations that remain after shipment other than warranty obligations 
contracts with customers do not include product return rights  however  the company may elect in certain circumstances to accept returns of products 
the company records revenue for product sales net of returns 
sales and use tax are reported on a net basis 
the company defers recognition of revenue on discounts to customers if discounts are considered significant 
in general  the company warrants its products to be free from defects in material and workmanship and will fully conform to and perform to specifications for a period of one year 
the company develops a warranty reserve based on historical experience 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its expectations  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that it has experienced in the past 
accounts receivable reserves this reserve is an estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are uncollectible 
the reserve is based on a combination of specific customer knowledge  general economic conditions and historical trends 
management believes the results could be materially different if economic conditions change for our customers 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of our cost or market value 
market value is an estimate of the future net realizable value of our inventory 
it is based on historical trends  product life cycles  forecasts of future inventory needs and on hand inventory levels 
management believes reserve levels could be materially affected by changes in technology  our customer base  customer needs  general economic conditions and the success of certain company sales programs 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually on november th of each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
consistent with prior years  in the company utilized the two step impairment analysis and elected not to use the qualitative assessment or step zero approach 
in the two step impairment analysis  in step one  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company would then complete step two in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step two  the company would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  the company would recognize an impairment loss  in the period identified  equal to the difference 
the company has concluded that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed as of november  long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets is periodically assessed to insure their carrying value does not exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from their expected use and eventual disposition 
this assessment includes certain assumptions related to future needs for the asset to help generate future cash flow 
changes in those assessments  future economic conditions or technological changes could have a material adverse impact on the carrying value of these assets 
deferred taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
actual future operating results  as well as changes in our future performance  could have a material impact on the valuation allowance 
employee benefit obligations we provide retirement and health care insurance for certain domestic and retirees and former selas employees 
we measure the costs of our obligation based on our best estimate 
the net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the post retirement benefit 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
we determine assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the future rate of compensation increases 
the actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
changes in actuarial assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events and different rates of retirement  mortality and withdrawal
