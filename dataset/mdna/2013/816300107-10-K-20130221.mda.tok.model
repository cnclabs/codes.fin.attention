reinsurance we use reinsurance to protect our capital resources and insure us against losses on property and casualty risks that we underwrite 
we use two main reinsurance vehicles i a reinsurance pooling agreement among our insurance subsidiaries in which each company agrees to share in premiums and losses based on certain specified percentages  and ii reinsurance contracts and arrangements with third parties that cover various policies that our insurance operations issue to insureds 
reinsurance pooling agreement the primary purposes of the reinsurance pooling agreement among our insurance subsidiaries are the following pool or share proportionately the underwriting profit and loss results of property and casualty insurance underwriting operations through reinsurance  prevent any of our insurance subsidiaries from suffering undue loss  reduce administration expenses  and permit all of the insurance subsidiaries to obtain a uniform rating from am best 
we amended the pooling agreement twice in i to add music  and ii to add the formation of two new insurance companies  selective casualty insurance company scic and selective fire and casualty insurance company sfcic 
the following illustrates the pooling percentages by company for the respective time frames throughout insurance subsidiary pooling percentage january june  pooling percentage july december  selective insurance company of america sica selective way insurance company swic selective insurance company of south carolina sicsc selective insurance company of the southeast sicse selective insurance company of new york sicny scic selective auto insurance company of new jersey saicnj music selective insurance company of new england sicne sfcic reinsurance treaties and arrangements by entering reinsurance treaties and arrangements  we are able to increase underwriting capacity and accept larger risks and a larger number of risks without directly increasing capital or surplus 
all of our reinsurance treaties are for traditional reinsurance  we do not purchase finite reinsurance 
under our reinsurance treaties  the reinsurer generally assumes a portion of the losses we cede to them in exchange for a portion of the premium 
amounts not reinsured are known as retention 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from liability under the terms and limits of our policies  but it does make our reinsurer liable to us for the amount of liability we cede to them 
accordingly  we have counterparty credit risk to our reinsurers 
we attempt to mitigate this credit risk by i pursuing relationships with reinsurers rated a or higher  and ii obtaining collateral to secure reinsurance obligations when possible 
some of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that permit us to terminate or commute the reinsurance treaty if the reinsurer financial condition or rating deteriorates 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers 
we also continuously review the quality of reinsurance recoverables and reserves for uncollectible reinsurance 
we primarily use the following three reinsurance treaty and arrangement types for property and casualty insurance treaty reinsurance  under which certain types of policies are automatically reinsured without prior approval by the reinsurer of the underlying individual insured risks  facultative reinsurance  under which an individual insurance policy or a specific risk is reinsured with the prior approval of the reinsurer 
we use facultative reinsurance for policies with limits greater than those available under our treaty reinsurance  and protection provided under the terrorism risk insurance act of as modified and extended through december  by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of collectively referred to as tria 
under tria  terrorism coverage is mandatory for all primary workers compensation policies 
insureds with non workers compensation commercial policies  however  have the option to accept or decline our terrorism coverage or negotiate with us for other terms 
under tria  each participating insurer is responsible for paying a deductible of specified losses based on a percentage of the prior year applicable commercial lines direct premiums earned before federal assistance is available 
in  our deductible is approximately million 
for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay and the insurer retains 
although tria provisions will mitigate our loss exposure to a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial

losses other than tria certified losses are subject to the following reinstatements and annual aggregate limits all nuclear  biological  chemical  and radioactive nbcr losses are excluded regardless of whether or not they are certified under tria 
for non nbcr losses  the treaty distinguishes between acts certified under tria and those that are not 
the treaty provides annual aggregate limits for tria certified other than nbcr acts of million for the first layer and million for the second layer

claims reserves net loss and loss expense reserves we establish loss and loss expense reserves that are estimates of the amounts we will need to pay in the future for claims and related expenses for insured losses that have already occurred 
estimating reserves as of any date involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and is inherently uncertain 
we regularly review our reserving techniques and our overall amount of reserves 
we also review information regarding each claim for losses  including potential extra contractual liabilities  or amounts paid in excess of the policy limits  which may not be covered by our contracts with reinsurers  our loss history and the industry s loss history  legislative enactments  judicial decisions and legal developments regarding damages  changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including inflation 
see critical accounting policies and estimates in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
of this form k for full discussion regarding our loss reserving process 
our loss and loss expense reserve development over the preceding years is shown on the following table  which has five parts section i shows the estimated liability recorded at the end of each indicated year for all current and prior accident year s unpaid loss and loss expenses 
the liability represents the estimated amount of loss and loss expenses for unpaid claims  including incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
in accordance with gaap  the liability for unpaid loss and loss expenses is recorded gross of the effects of reinsurance 
an estimate of reinsurance recoverables is reported separately as an asset 
the net balance represents the estimated amount of unpaid loss and loss expenses outstanding reduced by estimates of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts 
section ii shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded net liability as of the end of each succeeding year 
estimates of the liability of unpaid loss and loss expenses are increased or decreased as payments are made and more information regarding individual claims and trends  such as overall frequency and severity patterns  becomes known 
section iii shows the cumulative amount of net loss and loss expenses paid relating to recorded liabilities as of the end of each succeeding year 
section iv shows the re estimated gross liability and re estimated reinsurance recoverables through december  section v shows the cumulative net deficiency redundancy representing the aggregate change in the liability from the original balance sheet dates and the re estimated liability through december  this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected past reserve development may not necessarily occur in the future 
as a result  extrapolating redundancies or deficiencies based on this table is inherently uncertain

in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  we review our reserve estimates on a regular basis and make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustment is determined 
these reviews could result in the identification of information and trends that would require us to increase some reserves and or decrease other reserves for prior periods and could also lead to additional increases in loss and loss expense reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  equity  insurer financial strength  and debt ratings
