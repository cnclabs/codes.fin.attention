table of contents item a 
risk factors the following section includes the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business and operations 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this annual report on form k before deciding to invest in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future  and if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability  the market value of our common stock will likely decline 
we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company 
we do not currently have any products approved for sale  and we continue to incur significant research and development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations 
our net loss for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
we expect these losses and our cash utilization to increase in the near term as we continue to conduct clinical trials for ccx  ccx  ccx and ccx and conduct research and development of our other drug candidates 
glaxo group limited  or gsk  an affiliate of glaxosmithkline  has assumed all funding obligations for the further clinical development and commercialization of vercirnon and ccx if gsk exercises its option for further development and commercialization of ccx  our remaining drug candidate subject to the agreement  it will assume all funding obligations with respect to further clinical development of such drug candidate  but if it does not exercise such option  we will be responsible for such funding obligations 
all of our products are in development and none has been approved for sale 
to date  we have derived all of our revenues from up front fees and milestone payments  other payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements and government grants and contracts for research and development 
we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from the sale of our products for the foreseeable future 
in addition  if approved  we expect to incur significant costs to commercialize our drug candidates and our drugs may never gain market acceptance 
if our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials  do not gain regulatory approval  or do not achieve market acceptance  we may never become profitable 
even if we achieve profitability in the future  we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods 
if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability  the market value of our common stock will likely decline 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether we will become profitable 
the commercial success of vercirnon depends  in large part  on the development and marketing efforts of gsk  and if gsk is unable to perform in accordance with the terms of our agreement  or is unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals for vercirnon  our potential to generate future revenue from this drug candidate would be significantly reduced and our business would be materially and adversely harmed 
since inception  we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of our most advanced drug candidate  vercirnon 
we currently have five other drug candidates in clinical trials  but we anticipate that our ability to generate significant product revenues in the near term will depend primarily on the successful development  regulatory approval  marketing and commercialization of vercirnon by us or by gsk  which is subject to significant uncertainty 
in particular  we rely on gsk to fund and conduct the current pivotal phase iii trials with respect to vercirnon 
any of the following events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of vercirnon gsk may be unable to successfully complete the clinical development of vercirnon  gsk must comply with additional requests and recommendations from the fda  including additional clinical trials  
table of contents gsk may not obtain all necessary approvals from the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies  gsk may not commit sufficient resources to the development  regulatory approval  marketing and distribution of vercirnon  vercirnon must be manufactured in compliance with requirements of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and in commercial quantities sufficient to meet market demand  vercirnon may not achieve market acceptance by physicians  patients and third party payors  vercirnon may not compete successfully against alternative products and therapies  and we  gsk or any other pharmaceutical organization may independently develop products that compete with vercirnon 
in order to obtain approval from the fda of a new drug application  or nda  for vercirnon  gsk will need to demonstrate through evidence from adequate and well controlled clinical trials that vercirnon is safe and effective for each proposed indication 
however  vercirnon may not be approved even though it achieved its specified endpoints in the current and or future pivotal phase iii clinical trials intended to support an nda which may be conducted by gsk 
the fda may disagree with the trial design and the interpretation of data from clinical trials  may ask gsk to conduct additional costly and time consuming clinical trials in order to obtain marketing approval or approval to enter into an advanced phase of development  or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials 
the fda may also approve vercirnon for fewer or more limited indications than gsk may request  or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post approval clinical trials 
in addition  the fda may not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of vercirnon 
if gsk or any of our future collaboration partners does not perform in the manner we expect or fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner  or at all  the clinical development  regulatory approval  and commercialization efforts related to vercirnon could be delayed or terminated 
it may be necessary for us to assume the responsibility at our own expense for the development of vercirnon 
in that event  we would likely be required to limit the size and scope of one or more of our programs or increase our expenditures and seek additional funding and our potential to generate future revenue from vercirnon would be significantly reduced and our business would be materially and adversely harmed 
if gsk does not exercise its option thereunder  if the further development and commercialization efforts of gsk are not successful with respect to drug candidates for which it does exercise its options thereunder  or if gsk terminates the alliance or a particular program thereunder  we will not receive any additional revenue under the alliance with respect to such programs and our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
in august  we entered into our strategic alliance with gsk 
under the terms of our agreement  we are responsible for the discovery and development of small molecule antagonists targeting four defined chemokine and chemo attractant receptor targets ccr  ccr  car and chemr and taking them through clinical proof of concept  or to such other success criteria as are established by the jsc 
if we demonstrate the satisfaction of the applicable success criteria  gsk is entitled to options to exclusively license drug candidates that are subject to the collaboration and two defined back up compounds for each drug candidate for further development and commercialization on a worldwide basis 
in december  gsk exercised its option under the agreement to obtain an exclusive license for the further development and commercialization of vercirnon  our ccr drug candidate  and two identified back up compounds ccx and ccx 
as a result of gsk s exercise of this option  we are entitled to receive x up to million  in the aggregate  consisting of a non refundable option exercise fee of million and up to million in the aggregate for the filing of an nda in the united states and comparable filings in other territories  y up to million in the aggregate for the regulatory approval of products for 
table of contents commercial sale in the united states and other territories and z up to million in sales milestones 
in january  after gsk obtained hart scott rodino clearance for its option exercise  it paid us the option exercise fee of million and assumed sole responsibility for the further development and commercialization of vercirnon and its two designated back up compounds  at its expense  subject to our specified co development and commercial participation rights 
in november  gsk exercised its option under the agreement to obtain an exclusive license for the further development and commercialization of ccx  our ccr drug candidate  and two identified back up compounds ccx and ccx 
as a result of gsk s exercise of this option  we are entitled to receive x up to million  in the aggregate  consisting of a non refundable option exercise fee of million and up to million in the aggregate for the filing of an nda in the united states and comparable filings in other territories  y up to million in the aggregate for the regulatory approval of products for commercial sale in the united states and other territories and z up to million in sales milestones 
in december  gsk paid us the option exercise fee of million and assumed sole responsibility for the further development and commercialization of ccx and its two designated back up compounds  at its expense 
there is no assurance that gsk will be successful in its further development and commercialization of ccx or that the relevant regulatory filing or approval or sales milestones can be achieved such that we will receive the related milestone payments 
in february  we and gsk determined not to further advance the development of ccx chemr or its two designated back up compounds 
thus  gsk s only remaining option is to ccx car and its associated back up compounds ccx and ccx 
if gsk elects to exercise its option to ccx  we would be entitled to receive  as with ccx  x up to million  in the aggregate  consisting of an option exercise fee of million and up to million in the aggregate for the filing of an nda in the united states and comparable filings in other territories  y up to million in the aggregate for the regulatory approval of products for commercial sale in the united states and other territories and z up to million in sales milestones 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the success criteria established by the jsc under this strategic alliance with respect to ccx or that the relevant regulatory filing or approval milestones can be achieved for any our programs so that we will receive the related option exercise fees and milestone payments 
in addition  even if ccx results does satisfy the agreed upon success criteria  gsk is under no obligation to exercise its remaining option with respect to ccx and we cannot assure you that gsk will exercise such option  or that gsk will obtain hart scott rodino clearance with respect to such option  to the extent that such approval is required 
gsk may terminate the entire collaboration agreement or any collaboration program on a program by program basis for any reason upon days prior written notice to us 
the agreement or any program under the agreement may also be terminated for cause under certain circumstances  including material breach and insolvency 
in addition  gsk may terminate its rights with respect to the licensed product if it determines in good faith  for any reason  to cease the development and commercialization of such product and provides us with a written notice of such intent 
if gsk does not exercise its option with respect to ccx  terminates its rights with respect to a licensed product  or terminates the agreement we would not be entitled to receive the relevant option exercise fee or milestone payments  we would owe gsk up to royalties with respect to drug candidates covered by the agreement which we elected to subsequently commercialize  depending upon the stage of development at which such product commercialization rights reverted back to us  the development of our drug candidates subject to the agreement may be terminated or significantly delayed  
table of contents we may be required to hire additional employees and allocate scarce resources to the development and commercialization of drug candidates that were previously the subject of the gsk agreement and as a result our cash expenditures could increase significantly  we would bear all of the risks and costs related to the further development and commercialization of drug candidates that were previously the subject of the gsk agreement  including the reimbursement of third parties  and we may need to establish alternative collaboration arrangements  and we may not be able to do so  or may not be able to do so on terms which are acceptable to us  in which case we would likely be required to limit the size or scope of one or more of our programs or increase our expenditures and seek substantial additional funding 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking which involves a lengthy process  and our drug discovery and development activities therefore may not result in products that are approved by the applicable regulatory authorities on the time schedule we have planned  or at all 
our drug candidates are in the early stages of drug discovery or clinical trials and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  only six of our current drug candidates  vercirnon  ccx  ccx  ccx  ccx and ccx have been tested in human beings 
we will need to conduct significant additional preclinical studies and clinical trials before we can demonstrate that any of our drug candidates is safe and effective to the satisfaction of the fda and other regulatory authorities 
preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive and uncertain processes that take years to complete 
for example  we incurred significant expenses related to the ind filing and the completed single ascending dose phase i clinical trial for ccx  our first generation ccr drug candidate  which did not advance into phase ii clinical trials because its pharmacokinetic properties in humans did not meet our expectations 
failure can occur at any stage of the process  and we cannot assure you that any of our drug candidates will result in commercially successful products 
we cannot assure you that our ongoing clinical trials or any future clinical trial of any of our other drug candidates  will be completed on schedule  or at all  or whether our planned clinical trials will start in a timely manner 
the commencement of our planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by a number of factors  including delays or failures in obtaining sufficient quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  and or drug product  delays or failures in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites  delays or failures in obtaining institutional review board  or irb  approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site  the need to successfully complete  on a timely basis  preclinical safety pharmacology studies  the limited number of  and competition for  suitable sites to conduct the clinical trials  the limited number of  and competition for  suitable patients for enrollment in the clinical trials  and delays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial 
the completion of our clinical trials could also be substantially delayed or prevented by a number of factors  including slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment  
table of contents failure of patients to complete the clinical trials  failure of our third party vendors to timely or adequately perform their contractual obligations relating to the clinical trials  inability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols  inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment  termination of the clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites  unforeseen safety issues  lack of efficacy demonstrated during clinical trials  lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trials  the need for unexpected discussions with the fda or other foreign regulatory agencies regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials or the need to conduct additional trials  unforeseen delays by the fda or other foreign regulatory agencies after submission of our results  an unfavorable fda inspection of our contract manufacturers of api or drug product  and inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold 
any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our drug candidates would harm the commercial prospects for our drug candidates and adversely affect our financial results 
additionally  changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes 
amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to regulatory agencies and ethics committees for reexamination  which may impact the costs  timing or successful completion of a clinical trial 
if we experience delays in completion of  or if we terminate  any of our clinical trials  the commercial prospects for our drug candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed 
in addition  many of the factors that cause  or lead to  a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a drug candidate 
if we are required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks  or if we are required to conduct studies on the long term effects associated with the use of our drug candidates  our efforts to commercialize our products could be delayed or halted 
our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of safety related reasons 
for example  we may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that our drug candidates present an unacceptable safety risk to the clinical trial patients 
in addition  irbs or regulatory agencies may order the temporary discontinuation or termination of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements  including if they present an unacceptable safety risk to patients 
administering any drug candidate to humans may produce undesirable side effects 
the existence of undesirable side effects resulting from our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities  such as the fda  to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of our drug candidates and could result in the fda or other regulatory agencies denying further development or approval of our drug candidates for any or all targeted indications 
this  in turn  could affect whether gsk exercises its remaining option with respect to ccx under our strategic alliance and could prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates 
further  chemokine receptors and chemo attractant receptors are a novel class of targets 
as a result  we may experience unforeseen adverse side effects with our existing and future drug candidates  including vercirnon 
table of contents and ccx as of the date of this annual report on form k  six of our current drug candidates have been tested in human beings 
although we have not observed significant harmful side effects in prior studies of vercirnon  ccx or our other drug candidates  later trials could reveal such side effects 
the pharmacokinetic profile of preclinical studies may not be indicative of results in any clinical trial 
for example  prior to commencing our preclinical studies of our ccx drug candidate  we studied another drug candidate that targeted ccr  which we abandoned after pharmacokinetic results were not as favorable in humans as in earlier preclinical animal studies 
we have not conducted studies on the long term effects associated with the use of our drug candidates 
studies of these long term effects may be required for regulatory approval and would delay our introduction of vercirnon  ccx or our other drug candidates into the market 
these studies could also be required at any time after regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates 
absence of long term data may also limit the approved uses of our products  if any  to short term use 
some or all of our drug candidates may prove to be unsafe for human use 
even if our drug candidates do obtain regulatory approval they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success 
even if we obtain fda or other regulatory approvals  our drug candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians  patients and third party payors and  ultimately  may not be commercially successful 
market acceptance of our drug candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors  including the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials  the clinical indications for which the drug is approved  acceptance by physicians  major operators of clinics and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment  the potential and perceived advantages of our drug candidates over alternative treatments  the safety of drug candidates seen in a broader patient group  including its use outside the approved indications  the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments  the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities  relative convenience and ease of administration  the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects  and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
any failure by our drug candidates that obtain regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our financial results 
the commercial success of ccx depends  in part  on our ability to develop and market the drug in north america and to find partners to co develop and commercialize the drug outside north america  and if we fail in these initiatives  our ability to generate future revenue could be significantly reduced 
if we successfully complete the phase ii program for our lead independent drug candidate  ccx  we plan to initiate phase iii clinical trials either alone or together with a co development partner 
we plan to retain commercial rights to ccx in north america and find partners for co development and commercialization outside north america 
we have invested a significant amount of our time and financial resources in the development of ccx and our ability to generate future revenue will depend  in part  on our ability to identify a co development partner and the development  regulatory approval  marketing and commercialization of ccx by us and any future partners 
any of the following events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of ccx we may be unable to successfully complete the clinical development of ccx  
table of contents our lack of experience in commercializing and marketing drug products  we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient financial resources to develop and commercialize ccx  we may not be able to identify a suitable co development partner  we or any of our future partners may fail to fulfill our responsibilities in a timely manner or fail to commit sufficient resources to the development  regulatory approval  and commercialization efforts related to ccx  we or any of our future partners must comply with additional requests and recommendations from the fda  including additional clinical trials  we or any of our future partners may not obtain all necessary approvals from the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies  ccx must be manufactured in compliance with requirements of fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies and in commercial quantities sufficient to meet market demand  ccx may not achieve market acceptance by physicians  patients and third party payors  ccx may not compete successfully against alternative products and therapies  and we or any pharmaceutical company may independently develop products that compete with ccx we rely on third parties to conduct all our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our drug candidates 
we currently do not have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials 
we rely on medical institutions  clinical investigators  contract laboratories  collaborative partners and other third parties  such as clinical research organizations  or cros  to conduct clinical trials on our drug candidates 
the third parties with which we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data 
these third parties are not our employees  and except for contractual duties and obligations  we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
in particular  we rely on gsk to fund and conduct the current pivotal phase iii trials with respect to vercirnon 
although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials  we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol 
moreover  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards  commonly referred to as current good clinical practices  or cgcps  for conducting  monitoring  recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials 
in addition  the execution of preclinical studies and clinical trials  and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced  requires coordination among various parties 
in order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently  it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another 
moreover  these third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may compete with us 
in most cases  these third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon days prior written notice of a material breach by us that is not cured within days 
many of these agreements may also be terminated by such third parties under certain other circumstances  including our insolvency or our failure to comply with applicable laws 
in general  these agreements require such third parties to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of services of such third parties under the agreements 
if the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations  experience work stoppages  do not meet expected deadlines  terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial 
table of contents protocols or cgcps  or for any other reason  we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties  which could be costly  and our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the drug candidate being tested in such trials 
if any of our drug candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the drug candidate  our ability to market and derive revenue from the drugs could be compromised 
if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by one of our drugs  any of the following adverse events could occur regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the drug or seize the drug  we may be required to recall the drug or change the way the drug is administered  additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular drug or the manufacturing processes  we may be subject to fines  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements  such as a black box warning or a contraindication  we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients  we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients  the drug may become less competitive  and our reputation may suffer 
any of these could result in the loss of significant revenues  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business 
we will need additional financing and may be unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  or at all  when needed  which would force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and other operations or commercialization efforts 
we are advancing multiple drug candidates through discovery and development and will require substantial funds to conduct development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  of our drug candidates 
commercialization of any drug candidate will also require substantial expenditures 
while we currently expect gsk to assist us in our development and commercialization efforts with respect to those of our drug candidates for which gsk exercises an option under our agreement  we may also need additional financing to the extent that we are required to hire additional employees to co promote drug candidates or to commercialize drug candidates that may not be covered by our collaboration agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations for at least the next months 
our future financing requirements will depend on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the timing of  and costs involved in  seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the continuation and success of our strategic alliance with gsk and future collaboration partners  
table of contents the exercise of the remaining option with respect to ccx under the gsk agreement  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  our ability to enter into additional collaboration  licensing  government or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements  potential acquisition or in licensing of other products or technologies  and the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments 
future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses  products and technologies 
we currently have no understandings  commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  government grants and contracts and or strategic collaborations 
additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or our commercialization efforts 
we may be required to enter into collaborative partnerships for one or more of our drug candidate programs at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms  which may require us to relinquish rights to some of our drug candidates that we would otherwise have pursued on our own 
we may form additional strategic alliances in the future with respect to our independent programs  and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances 
we may form strategic alliances  create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our independent programs that we believe will complement or augment our existing business 
for example  we plan to find a partner for co development and commercialization of ccx outside north america upon completion of clinical development of ccx for the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex 
moreover  we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any future product candidates and programs because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient  our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy 
we cannot be certain that  following a strategic transaction or license  we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies such transaction 
any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could also delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market 
key elements of our proprietary suite of drug discovery technologies  known as enabalink  including our ram screening technology  are new approaches to the discovery and development of new drug candidates and may not result in the discovery of any small molecule compounds of commercial value 
we must continue to identify and develop compounds that target the chemokine network and expand our portfolio of drug candidates 
research programs to identify new disease targets and drug candidates require substantial technical  financial and human resources 
we have limited resources to study the more than known chemokine ligands  as described in a february article in the new england journal of medicine  and approximately identified chemokine receptors 
enabalink represents a new approach to the development of new drug candidates see item business our proprietary drug discovery platform  enabalink and we cannot assure you that enabalink will result in the discovery of new drug candidates 
enabalink has only 
table of contents resulted in a limited number of clinical and preclinical stage programs to date  and we may not identify any therapeutic small molecule compounds of commercial value using enabalink or other commercially available drug discovery technologies 
if our reverse activation of migration  or ram  screening technology or any other screening technologies fail to identify highly specific hits that lead to the development of new drug candidates  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
our scientists may be unable to optimize the chemical hits identified by our ram screening technology and develop the identified starting material into a candidate for further development that meets the desired product criteria 
our research and development programs may initially show promise in identifying chemokine receptors and their impact on the body s immune system  yet fail to yield drug candidates that are suitable for preclinical and clinical development 
we cannot assure you that our current efforts will be successful or that we will not abandon any of our efforts in the future related to a particular chemokine receptor or small molecule program 
we rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply our drug candidates for us  other than vercirnon and ccx for which gsk has manufacturing responsibility 
if one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs  we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new suppliers or manufacturers 
we may also face delays in the development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
following gsk s exercise of its options for the further development of vercirnon and ccx  it assumed sole manufacturing responsibility for those drug candidates and each of their two respective back up compounds and we are no longer involved in their manufacture 
we currently have limited experience in  and we do not own facilities for  manufacturing our other drug candidates 
we rely upon third party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply larger quantities of these other drug candidates 
the manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  requires significant expertise and capital investment  including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production  including difficulties with production costs and yields  quality control  including stability of the drug candidate and quality assurance testing  shortages of qualified personnel  as well as compliance with strictly enforced fda cgmp requirements  other federal and state regulatory requirements  and foreign regulations 
raw materials for the synthesis of our api are sourced globally 
if the manufacturers of our raw materials and pharmaceutical products were to encounter any difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations  our ability to provide study drugs in our preclinical studies and clinical trials would be jeopardized 
any delay or interruption in the supply of preclinical study or clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  increase the costs associated with maintaining our preclinical study and clinical trial programs and  depending upon the period of delay  require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the studies and trials completely 
all manufacturers of our drug candidates must comply with cgmp requirements enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
these requirements include  among other things  quality control  quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturers of our component materials may be unable to comply with these cgmp requirements and with other fda  state and foreign regulatory requirements 
the fda or similar foreign regulatory agencies at any time may also implement new standards  or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture  packaging or testing of products 
we have little control over our manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
a failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties  suspension of production  suspension or delay in product approval  product seizure or recall  or withdrawal of product approval 
if the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products  and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result 
any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials  regulatory submissions  approvals or commercialization of our drug candidates or entail higher costs or impair our reputation 

table of contents we currently rely on a single source supplier for api for each of our drug candidates  other than vercirnon and ccx for which the responsibility for supplying the api and drug product has been assumed by gsk 
irix pharmaceuticals  inc  currently manufactures the api for ccx and ccx for our phase ii clinical trials and ccx for our phase i clinical trial 
cambridge major laboratories has been contracted to manufacture ccx api for our phase iii clinical trials 
carbogen amcis produces the api for ccx our current agreements with our suppliers do not provide for the entire supply of the api necessary for additional clinical trials or for full scale commercialization 
we have agreements with the university of iowa pharmaceuticals to manufacture the drug product for ccx for our phase ii clinical trials and gsk to manufacture the drug product for ccx patheon has been contracted to manufacture ccx drug product for our phase iii clinical trials 
in the event that we and our suppliers cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide some or all of our api clinical and commercial supply needs  or if any single source supplier terminates the agreement in response to a breach by us  we would not be able to manufacture the api on a commercial scale until a qualified alternative supplier is identified  which could also delay the development of  and impair our ability to commercialize  drug candidates 
although alternative sources of supply exist  the number of third party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities is limited  and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
new suppliers of any api would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing such ingredients 
obtaining the necessary fda approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non infringement of third party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us 
we currently have no sales and marketing staff or distribution organization 
if we are unable to develop a sales and marketing and distribution capability on our own or through collaborations with gsk or other marketing partners  we will not be successful in commercializing our future products 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities or experience 
if our products are approved for sale  we intend to rely on gsk to assist us in the marketing and distribution of our products for which gsk has exercised an option under our agreement  but there can be no assurance it will elect to market and distribute our products or that it will not terminate our collaboration arrangement 
if gsk does not exercise its remaining option with respect to ccx  we may need to enter into distribution or co marketing arrangements with other third parties 
to the extent we rely on third parties for marketing and distributing our approved products  any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  which may not be successful and are only partially within our control and our product revenue is likely to be lower than if we directly marketed or sold our products 
gsk or other future collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our drug candidates because they cannot obtain necessary regulatory approvals  development or commercialization is not commercially reasonable  they elect to pursue competitive products outside of the collaboration  or for other reasons 
if we are unable to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize the approved products on acceptable terms or at all  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our future products or we will have to market these products ourselves  which will be expensive and require us to build our own sales force  which we do not have experience doing 
for example  we plan to retain commercial rights to ccx in north america and intend to build a small specialty sales force calling on nephrologists in north america 
in addition  under our collaboration agreement with gsk  we have co promotion rights with respect to certain drugs  but we do not have experience managing a sales force  selling drugs or marketing drugs 
we cannot assure you we will be successful in any of these initiatives 
if we are not successful in commercializing our future products  either on our own or through collaborations with gsk or one or more third parties  or co promoting drugs with gsk  any future product revenue will be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we will need to increase the size of our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing growth 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we will need to continue to expand our managerial  operational  financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials  continue our development activities and commercialize our drug candidates 
our management and personnel  systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth 
our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we manage our clinical trials effectively  including our phase ii clinical trials for ccx and ccx  which are being conducted at numerous trial sites throughout the world  manage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to licensors  contractors  collaborators  government agencies and other third parties  continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  and identify  recruit  maintain  motivate and integrate additional employees 
we face substantial competition and our competitors may discover  develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive  and we face significant competition from companies in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other related markets that are researching and marketing products designed to address ibd  chronic kidney disease  including diabetic nephropathy  rheumatoid arthritis  other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders  and cancer 
established pharmaceutical companies that currently sell or are developing drugs in our markets of interest include  for example  abbvie  amgen  astrazeneca  biogen idec  bayer  elan  gsk  johnson johnson  merck  merck serono  takeda  novartis  pfizer  sanofi and teva 
many or all of these established competitors are also involved in research and drug development regarding various chemokine receptors 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are known to be involved in chemokine research and related drug development include pfizer  gsk  bristol myers squibb  merck  takeda  sanofi  incyte  and ucb pharma among others 
we are developing small molecule therapeutics that will compete with other drugs and alternative therapies that are currently marketed or are being developed to treat ibd  chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy  rheumatoid arthritis  other autoimmune diseases  metabolic diseases  inflammatory disorders  and cancer 
if approved for marketing by the fda  vercirnon  our lead ibd drug candidate  would compete against existing ibd treatments such as remicade  humira  and other tnf a inhibitors  tysabri  and immunomodulatory drugs and corticosteroids and potentially against other novel ibd drug candidates that are currently in development 
similarly  other future drug candidates we are pursuing would compete against numerous existing and established drugs and potentially against other novel drugs and therapies that are currently in development 
see item business competition 
we also anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter into our target markets and scientific developments surrounding the chemokine system continue to develop 
many of our competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial  manufacturing  marketing  research and drug development resources than we do 
additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors 
large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs 
in addition  academic institutions  government agencies  and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies 
these organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors 

table of contents we may be subject to costly product liability claims related to our clinical trials and drug candidates and  if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from  or beyond the limits of  our insurance coverage  a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition 
because we conduct clinical trials with human patients  we face the risk that the use of our drug candidates may result in adverse side effects to patients and to otherwise healthy volunteers in our clinical trials 
we face even greater risks upon any commercialization of our drug candidates 
although we have product liability insurance for clinical trials for up to million  our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer  and we will be required to increase our product liability insurance coverage for our advanced clinical trials that we plan to initiate 
we do not know whether we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from  or beyond the limits of  our insurance coverage 
there is also a risk that third parties that we have agreed to indemnify could incur liability 
an individual may bring a product liability claim against us if one of our drug candidates or products causes  or is claimed to have caused  an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  investigators  patients or trial sites  the inability to commercialize our drug candidates  decreased demand for our drug candidates  regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications  loss of revenues  substantial costs of litigation  liabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance  which we would then be required to pay ourselves  an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  the diversion of management s attention from our business  and damage to our reputation and the reputation of our products 
our business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which may be expensive and restrict how we do business 
our third party manufacturers activities and our own activities involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials  including the components of our pharmaceutical products  test samples and reagents  biological materials and other hazardous compounds 
we and our manufacturers are subject to federal  state and local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these hazardous materials 
we currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use  storage  handling or disposal of hazardous materials 
in the event of an accident  state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and or interrupt our business operations 
in addition  if an accident or environmental discharge occurs  or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations  including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire  we could be liable for cleanup obligations  damages and fines 
the substantial unexpected costs we may incur could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents future financings may adversely affect our stockholders or impose restrictions on our assets or operations  which may harm our business 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities  then our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over our common stock 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt securities  the debt will have rights senior to the holders of our common stock and may contain covenants that restrict our operational flexibility or impose liens or other restrictions on our assets 
in addition  the terms of future financings may restrict our ability to raise additional capital  which would delay or prevent the further development or commercialization of our drug candidates 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration  licensing or other similar arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our current drug candidates  potential products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and we may be required to delay  significantly curtail or eliminate the development of one or more of our drug candidates 
we are highly dependent on the services of our founder  president and chief executive officer  dr 
thomas j 
schall  and if we are not able to retain dr 
schall or other members of our management or recruit additional management  clinical and scientific personnel  our business will suffer 
we may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and other businesses  particularly in the san francisco bay area 
our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years 
if we are not able to attract  retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives  our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of service of any of our management could harm our business 
in addition  we are dependent on our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified additional management  clinical and scientific personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense 
due to our limited resources  we may not be able to effectively attract and recruit additional qualified personnel 
if we are not able to retain our management  particularly our founder  president and chief executive officer  dr 
schall  and attract  on acceptable terms  additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business  we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow 
although we have executed employment agreements with each member of our current executive management team  including dr 
schall  these agreements are terminable at will with or without notice and  therefore  we may not be able to retain their services as expected 
in addition to the competition for personnel  the san francisco bay area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living 
as such  we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts 
in addition  we have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development and clinical strategies 
these advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us  or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours 
requirements associated with being a public company increase our costs significantly  as well as divert significant company resources and management attention 
prior to our initial public offering in february  we were not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  or the other rules and regulations of the sec or any securities exchange relating to public companies 
we are continuing to work with our legal  independent 
table of contents accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company 
these areas include corporate governance  corporate control  internal audit  disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems 
we have made  and will continue to make  changes in these and other areas 
however  the expenses that will be required in order to continue as a public company could be material 
compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies also require considerable time and attention of management 
in addition  the changes we make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis 
in addition  being a public company may make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officers liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
we are an emerging growth company and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of other public companies and we also are entitled to utilize other reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies 
we are an emerging growth company  as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of jobs act  and we intend to utilize certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including  but not limited to  not being required to provide the auditor attestation report otherwise required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements  and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved 
in addition  section of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in section a b of the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  for implementing new or revised accounting standards 
in other words  an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies 
we are electing to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards  and as a result  we may not implement new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non emerging growth companies 
as a result of such election  our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies 
we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions 
if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result  there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 
we may utilize these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company 
we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years  although if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds million as of any june before that time  we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following december we are required to maintain compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of or we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities 
section a of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and beginning with this annual report on form k provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting 
we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required to comply with the management certification 
once we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act  we will also need to comply with auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanes oxley act of if we do not properly implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission  or sec  or the nasdaq stock market 
table of contents llc  or nasdaq 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall 
if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting  we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses  we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by nasdaq  the sec or other regulatory authorities  which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could materially adversely affect our stock price 
we may be adversely affected by the current economic environment 
our ability to attract and retain collaboration partners or customers  invest in and grow our business and meet our financial obligations depends on our operating and financial performance  which  in turn  is subject to numerous factors  including the prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors beyond our control  such as the rate of unemployment  the number of uninsured persons in the united states and inflationary pressures 
we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business 
we are exposed to risks associated with reduced profitability and the potential financial instability of our collaboration partners or customers  many of which may be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets 
for example  unemployment and underemployment  and the resultant loss of insurance  may decrease the demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals 
if fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage  our collaboration partners or customers may experience reductions in revenues  profitability and or cash flow that could lead them to reduce their support of our programs or financing activities 
if collaboration partners or customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
this  in turn  could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  if economic challenges in the united states result in widespread and prolonged unemployment  either regionally or on a national basis  prior to the effectiveness of certain provisions of the affordable care act  a substantial number of people may become uninsured or underinsured 
to the extent economic challenges result in fewer individuals pursuing or being able to afford our products once commercialized  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
our internal computer systems  or those of our cros or other contractors or consultants  may fail or suffer security breaches  which could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs 
despite the implementation of security measures  our internal computer systems and those of our cros and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses  unauthorized access  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication and electrical failures 
while we have not experienced any such system failure  accident or security breach to date  if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations  it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs 
for example  the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our drug candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information  we could incur liability and the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed 
our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements 
we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct 
misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with fda regulations  provide accurate information to the fda  comply with manufacturing standards we have established  comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations  report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us 
in particular  
table of contents sales  marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud  kickbacks  self dealing and other abusive practices 
these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing  discounting  marketing and promotion  sales commission  customer incentive programs and other business arrangements 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation 
it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations 
if any such actions are instituted against us  and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights  those actions could have a significant impact on our business  including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 
our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 
under section of the internal revenue code  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change  by value  in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre change tax attributes to offset its post change taxable income and taxes may be limited 
we previously determined that we had ownership changes that occurred in july and june  which limit our ability to use our then existing tax attributes 
future changes in our stock ownership  many of the causes of which are outside our control  could result in additional ownership changes 
any such ownership changes could further limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other pre change tax attributes 
business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
our operations could be subject to earthquakes  power shortages  telecommunications failures  floods  hurricanes  typhoons  fires  extreme weather conditions  medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions 
the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
our corporate headquarters is located in california and certain clinical sites for our drug candidates  operations of our existing and future partners and suppliers are or will be located in california near major earthquake faults and fire zones 
the ultimate impact on us  our significant partners  suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown  but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake  fire or other natural or manmade disaster 
risks related to intellectual property we may have to license rights from millennium pharmaceuticals  inc or engage in patent litigation in order to secure the rights necessary to commercialize vercirnon 
patent litigation could absorb significant management time and financial resources  and  if we do not prevail  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from our agreement with gsk 
millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  or millennium  has obtained certain us patents which include claims to small molecules that modulate ccr  compositions thereof  and methods of using them to treat conditions such as ibd 
we became aware of millennium s ccr related patent applications during our own routine patent and patent literature review 
millennium  which was acquired by takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  in may and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of takeda  may contend that the claims of these patents cover our patented vercirnon drug candidate 
we believe that our activities related to vercirnon are currently exempt from patent infringement liability because these activities are strictly limited to obtaining information for regulatory approval 
however  if and when our vercirnon related activities extend beyond those related to seeking regulatory approval  such as  for example  if and when we commercialize vercirnon  millennium might then commence an infringement action against us based on these patents and or other related 
table of contents patents that it may be granted in the future 
if millennium elects to sue us  we believe that we may have viable defenses to any such infringement suit 
however  we cannot assure you that the relevant court would find in our favor with respect to such defenses 
intellectual property litigation and patent litigation in particular  is expensive  complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict 
a court could enter orders that temporarily  preliminarily or permanently enjoin us or our strategic partners from using  selling  offering to sell or importing out current or future drug candidates or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities 
during  we did engage in preliminary discussions with millennium regarding potentially collaborating with respect to ccr  given that both we and millennium have patents relating to ccr however  these discussions were general in nature and did not progress beyond the preliminary stage 
other than these preliminary discussions  we have not had any conversations or contacts with millennium relating to ccr in addition  in april  an opposition was filed with the european patent office by millennium with respect to one of our patents relating to broad genus claims describing small molecules that target ccr  the scope of which also relates to vercirnon 
the opposition filed by millennium alleges that the subject matter of such patent is not novel  such patent does not involve an inventive step  such patent does not sufficiently disclose the invention and the subject matter of such patent extends beyond the content of its patent application 
the european patent office is currently evaluating our response to the opposition 
we disagree with the points alleged in the opposition and will defend our issued european patent in question vigorously 
furthermore  we hold patents in europe on ccr inhibitors including a selection patent on vercirnon that are not subject to the opposition filed 
under our agreement with gsk  gsk has the right  but not the obligation  to defend against third party patent infringement claims for licensed drugs 
if gsk elects to defend against any such claims  it has the sole right to direct the defense of such claims and settle such claims at its own cost and expense 
if gsk elects not to defend against such claims  we have the right  but not the obligation  to defend against such claims 
we may also be subject to negative publicity due to litigation 
pending or future patent litigation against us or any strategic partners by millennium or anyone else may force us or any strategic partners to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential drug candidates that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or any strategic partners rights to use its intellectual property 
if millennium is able to obtain an injunction and neither we nor our strategic partners are able to obtain a license  both we and our strategic partners would be precluded from the manufacture and sale of vercirnon 
us patents are entitled to a presumption of validity and the burden of proving invalidity would be heavily weighted against us 
specifically  we would be required to show by clear and convincing evidence that millennium s patents are invalid 
such decisions on patent validity often favor the patent owner because of the presumption of validity 
if we or our strategic partners are unable to show that millennium s patent is invalid and neither we nor our strategic partners are able to obtain a license from millennium for the use of their intellectual property at all or on commercially acceptable terms  this would preclude both us and our strategic partners from the manufacture and sale of vercirnon or related candidate compounds found to be covered by millennium s patent claims 
if we are able to obtain a license from millennium  we will be solely responsible for all fees required to be paid to millennium in connection with such license and gsk will bear no responsibility for such license fees 
see item business intellectual property 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceedings  such as interference proceedings  which are meant to determine who first invented any of the claims covered by the patent even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
discovery proceedings in the united states might lead to the disclosure of some of our proprietary confidential information 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management and technical staff s time which may materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and drug candidates 
if we are unable to protect our drug candidates and our intellectual property rights  it may materially adversely affect our position in the market 
our commercial success will depend on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for our technologies  intellectual property and drug candidates in the united states and other countries 
our patent estate  on a worldwide basis  includes approximately issued or allowed patents and approximately pending patent applications  with claims relating to all of our current clinical stage drug candidates 
with respect to our lead drug candidates in the ccr  ccr and ccr programs  we have approximately issued or allowed patents worldwide relating to their chemical composition or use thereof 
there are also patent applications pending for our other clinical stage compounds in the car  cxcr and ccr programs 
we have approximately issued patents relating to other small molecule compounds and approximately issued patents relating to our novel biological discoveries 
we also have approximately issued patents relating to our proprietary screening and drug development technologies 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
if third parties disclose or misappropriate our proprietary rights  it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market 
we apply for patents covering both our technologies and drug candidates  as we deem appropriate 
however  we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or drug candidates in a timely fashion  or at all 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies 
moreover  the patent positions of numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
as a result  the validity and enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with certainty 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications  we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies by inventing around our claims  any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  a third party will not challenge our proprietary rights or that a court will hold that our patents are valid and enforceable  any patents issued to us or our collaboration partners will provide us with any competitive advantages  or will not be challenged by third parties  we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights 
for example  on september   president obama signed the america invents act which codifies several significant changes to the us patent laws  including  among other things  changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system  limiting where a patentee may file a patent suit  requiring the apportionment of patent damages  replacing interference proceedings with derivation actions  and creating a post grant opposition process to challenge patents after they have issued 
the effects of these changes are currently unclear as the uspto must still implement various regulations  the courts have yet to address any of these provisions  and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed 

table of contents we rely upon unpatented trade secrets  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position  which we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants 
we also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us 
however  it is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement 
furthermore  if the employees and consultants that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation  and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations 
further  our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors 
in addition  intellectual property laws in foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we may become subject to third parties claims alleging infringement of patents and proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate our patents or proprietary rights  which would be costly  time consuming and  if successfully asserted against us  delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our products 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
we may be subject to third party claims in the future against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages  including treble damages and attorney s fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party s patents 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators  we or they could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or drug candidate that is the subject of the suit 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or in order to avoid potential claims  we or our collaborators may choose to seek  or be required to seek  a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or forced to redesign it  or to cease some aspect of our business operations if  as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims  we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
this could harm our business significantly 
in addition to infringement claims against us  if third parties prepare and file patent applications in the united states that also claim technology to which we have rights  we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the uspto to determine the priority of invention 
we may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the european patent office regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology 
restrictions on our patent rights relating to our drug candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our drug candidates  preserve our trade secrets  prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
composition of matter patents on apis are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products as they apply without regard to any method of use 
entirely new individual chemical compounds  often referred to as new chemical entities  are typically entitled to composition of matter coverage 
however  we cannot be certain that the current law will remain the same  or that our drug candidates will be considered novel and non obvious by the uspto and courts 
in addition to composition of matter patents and patent applications  we also have filed method of use patent applications 
this type of patent protects the use of the product only for the specified method 
however  this type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method 
moreover  even if these competitors do 
table of contents not actively promote their product for our targeted indication  physicians may prescribe these products off label 
although off label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents  the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute 
patent applications in the united states and most other countries are confidential for a period of time until they are published  and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months or more 
as a result  we cannot be certain that we and the inventors of the issued patents and applications that we may in license were the first to conceive of the inventions covered by such patents and pending patent applications or that we and those inventors were the first to file patent applications covering such inventions 
also  we have numerous issued patents and some patent applications pending before the uspto and the patent protection may lapse before we manage to obtain commercial value from them  which might result in increased competition and materially affect our position in the market 
we may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees or consultants former employers or their clients 
these claims may be costly to defend and if we do not successfully do so  we may be required to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
many of our employees were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
although no claims against us are currently pending  we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper our ability to commercialize  or prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates  which could severely harm our business 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
some of our intellectual property which is discovered through government funded programs is subject to federal regulation such as march in rights  certain reporting requirements  and a preference for us industry 
compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights  subject us to expenditure of resources with respect to reporting requirements  and limit our ability to contract with foreign manufacturers 
some of our existing drug candidates  including ccx  and some of our research and development work were funded  at least in part  by the us government and are therefore subject to certain federal regulations 
for example  some of our research and development work on vaccine adjuvants and immunomodulation for biothreat applications was funded by government research grants 
in addition  as noted on several of our patents including us patent nos 
    and  inventions covering various ccr and ccr antagonists were supported at least in part by nih funding u ai 
under the march in provisions of the bayh dole act  the government may have the right under limited circumstances to require us to grant exclusive  partially exclusive or non exclusive rights to third parties for intellectual property discovered through the government funded program 
the government can exercise its march in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the new invention or because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs of the public 
intellectual property discovered under the government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements  compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources 
such intellectual property is also subject to a preference for us industry  which may limit our ability to contract with foreign product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property 
we plan to apply for additional us government funding  and it is possible that we may discover compounds or drug candidates as a result of such funding 
intellectual property under such discoveries would be subject to the applicable provisions of the bayh dole act 

table of contents risks related to government regulation the regulatory approval process is expensive  time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our collaboration partners from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our drug candidates 
the research  testing  manufacturing  labeling  approval  selling  import  export  marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  which regulations differ from country to country 
neither we nor our collaboration partners are permitted to market our drug candidates in the united states until we receive approval of an nda from the fda 
neither we nor our collaboration partners have submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates 
obtaining approval of an nda can be a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process 
in addition  failure to comply with fda and other applicable us and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  including warning letters  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  withdrawal of approved products  product seizure or detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending ndas or supplements to approved ndas 
prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug candidates in the united states or abroad  we and our collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials  and to the satisfaction of the fda and other regulatory authorities abroad  that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses 
results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways 
even if we and our collaboration partners believe the preclinical or clinical data for our drug candidates are promising  such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
administering any of our drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects  which could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of our drug candidates and result in the fda or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our drug candidates for any or all targeted indications 
regulatory approval of an nda or nda supplement is not guaranteed  and the approval process is expensive and may take several years 
the fda also has substantial discretion in the approval process 
despite the time and expense exerted  failure can occur at any stage  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials  or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda approval varies depending on the drug candidate  the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address  and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 
the fda can delay  limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons  including  but not limited to  the following a drug candidate may not be deemed safe or effective  fda officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient  the fda might not approve our or our third party manufacturer s processes or facilities  or the fda may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations 
if any of our drug candidates fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval  our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed 

table of contents even if we receive regulatory approval for a drug candidate  we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review  which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
once regulatory approval has been granted  the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the fda and or non us regulatory authorities 
any regulatory approval that we or our collaboration partners receive for our drug candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing follow up studies to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product 
the fda also has authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  as part of an nda or after approval  which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug  such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training  limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe use criteria or requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry 
in addition  if the fda and or non us regulatory authorities approve any of our drug candidates  we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the fda and other regulatory authorities with regard to the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and recordkeeping for our products 
the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products 
in particular  a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the fda as reflected in the product s approved labeling 
if we receive marketing approval for any of our product candidates  physicians may nevertheless prescribe our products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label 
if we are found to have promoted such off label uses  we may become subject to significant liability and government fines 
in addition  manufacturers of our drug products are required to comply with cgmp  regulations  which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
further  regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our drug products  and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cgmp regulations 
if we or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown problems with a product  such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product  the manufacturer or us  including imposition of a rems or requesting recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing 
if we  our drug candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our drug candidates fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the fda and or other non us regulatory authorities  we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  including warning letters  civil or criminal penalties  injunctions  suspension of or withdrawal of regulatory approval  suspension of any ongoing clinical trials  voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements  refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications filed by us  restrictions on operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  or seizure or detention of our products or import bans 
the regulatory requirements and policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted for which we may also be required to comply 
for example  the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of requires the fda to issue new guidance on permissible forms of internet and social media promotion of regulated medical products  and the fda may soon specify new restrictions on this form of 
table of contents product promotion 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or in other countries 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we will not be permitted to market our future products and our business will suffer 
the availability of adequate third party coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs is uncertain  and failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors could impede our ability to market any future products we may develop and could limit our ability to generate revenue 
there is significant uncertainty related to the third party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs 
the commercial success of our future products in both domestic and international markets depends on whether such third party coverage and reimbursement is available for our future products 
governmental payors  including medicare and medicaid  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to manage their healthcare expenditures by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and  as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate reimbursement for our future products 
these payors may not view our future products as cost effective  and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers or may not be sufficient to allow our future products to be marketed on a competitive basis 
third party payors are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of  and coverage and reimbursement levels for  particular treatments 
such third party payors  including medicare  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services  and many third party payors limit or delay coverage and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products 
in particular  third party payors may limit the covered indications 
cost control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products  which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues 
if the prices for our drug candidates decrease or if governmental and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement  our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products internationally 
we intend to seek a distribution and marketing partner for ccx outside north america and may market future products in international markets 
in order to market our future products in the eea which is comprised of the member states of the eu plus norway  iceland and liechtenstein and many other foreign jurisdictions  we must obtain separate regulatory approvals 
more concretely  in the eea  medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization  or ma 
there are two types of marketing authorizations the community ma  which is issued by the european commission through the centralized procedure  based on the opinion of the committee for medicinal products for human use of the european medicines agency  or ema  and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the eea 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products  such as biotechnology medicinal products  orphan medicinal products  and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of aids  cancer  neurodegenerative disorders  diabetes  auto immune and viral diseases 
the centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the eea  or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic  scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the eu 
national mas  which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the eea and only cover their respective territory  are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure 
where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the eea  this national ma can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure 
if the product has not received a national ma in any member state at the time of application  it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure 

table of contents under the above described procedures  before granting the ma  the ema or the competent authorities of the member states of the eea make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality  safety and efficacy 
we have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities  and the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda 
however  a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
we may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market 
healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our drug candidates commercial success 
in the united states  there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers 
federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and  at times  enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system  some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services 
for example  in march  the president signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades  the affordable care act 
it contains a number of provisions  including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs  reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures  all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs 
the affordable care act  among other things imposes a non deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell branded prescription drugs  effective  increases the minimum level of medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from to  requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by medicaid managed care organizations  requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program  under which they must agree to offer point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period  as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d  beginning january  and mandates a further shift in the burden of medicaid payments to the states 
other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted 
on august   the president signed into law the budget control act of  which  among other things  creates the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress 
the joint select committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least trillion for the years through  triggering the legislation s automatic reduction to several government programs 
this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to per fiscal year  starting in on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  or the atra  which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the budget control act of the atra  among other things  also reduced medicare payments to several providers  including hospitals  imaging centers and cancer treatment centers  and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 
at this time  it remains uncertain how the sequestrations provisions will be addressed 

table of contents there likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care 
we cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact 
the continuing efforts of the government  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect our ability to set a price we believe is fair for our products  our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability  and the availability of capital 
further  changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes 
amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to irbs for reexamination  which may impact the costs  timing or successful completion of a clinical trial 
in light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products  regulatory authorities  members of congress  the governmental accounting office  medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues 
these events have resulted in the recall and withdrawal of drug products  revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of risk management programs that may  for instance  restrict distribution of drug products or require safety surveillance and or patient education 
the increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the fda to clinical trials and the drug approval process 
data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety  which may make the fda or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate or suspend clinical trials before completion  or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought 
heightened congressional scrutiny on the adequacy of the fda s drug approval process and the agency s efforts to assure the safety of marketed drugs resulted in the enactment of legislation addressing drug safety issues  the fda amendments act of  or fdaaa 
this legislation provided the fda with expanded authority over drug products after approval  including the authority to impose the requirement for a rems to assure the safe use of the drug  either as a condition for product approval or after a product is approved on the basis of new safety information 
a rems could include medication guides  physician communication plans  or elements to assure safe use  such as restricted distribution methods  patient registries and other risk minimization tools 
any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion  distribution  prescription or dispensing of our product candidates  if approved 
the fda s exercise of this authority under fdaaa has resulted in delays or increased costs during the period of product development  clinical trials and regulatory review and approval  and increased costs to assure compliance with new post approval regulatory requirements 
given the serious public health risks of high profile adverse safety events with certain drug products  the fda may require  as a condition of approval  costly risk management programs which may include safety surveillance  restricted distribution and use  patient education  enhanced labeling  special packaging or labeling  expedited reporting of certain adverse events  preapproval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct to consumer advertising 
if we fail to comply with healthcare regulations  we could face substantial penalties and our business  operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors  certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients rights are and will be applicable to our business 
we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business 
the regulations that may affect our ability to operate include  without limitation the federal healthcare program anti kickback statute  which prohibits  among other things  any person from knowingly and willfully offering  soliciting  receiving or providing remuneration  directly or 
table of contents indirectly  to induce either the referral of an individual  for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service  for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs  the federal false claims act  which prohibits  among other things  individuals or entities from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  false claims  or knowingly using false statements  to obtain payment from the federal government  and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing advice to customers  federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters  the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information  and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws  such as anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor  including commercial insurers 
the recently enacted affordable care act  among other things  amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes 
a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 
in addition  the affordable care act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims act 
further  there has been a recent trend in the increase of federal and state laws and regulations regarding consulting arrangements with physicians 
the affordable care act imposes new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and others  including reporting any transfer of value made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during each calendar year beginning in  subject to federal implementation and enforcement policies 
in addition  some states  such as california  massachusetts and vermont  mandate that we comply with a state code of conduct  adopt a company code of conduct under state criteria  disclose marketing payments made to physicians  and or report compliance information to the state authorities 
the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that a pharmaceutical company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements 
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  the exclusion from participation in us federal or state health care programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any penalties  damages  fines  curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business 
moreover  achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy  security and fraud laws may prove costly 
risks related to the securities markets and an investment in our stock there may not be a viable market for our common stock or the price of our common stock may be volatile  and stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at prices that are attractive to them 
there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering in february  the trading volume of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market has been limited and there can be 
table of contents no assurance that an active and liquid trading market for our common stock will be sustained 
we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market on the nasdaq global select market or otherwise or how liquid that market might become 
if an active public market does not develop or is not sustained  it may be difficult for stockholders to sell their shares of common stock at prices that are attractive to them  or at all 
further  an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products  product candidates or technologies by using our shares of common stock as consideration 
stockholders may also be unable to sell their shares of common stock at prices that are attractive to them due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include  but are not limited to results from  and any delays in  clinical trial programs relating to our drug candidates  including the ongoing and planned clinical trials for vercirnon  ccx  ccx  ccx and other drug candidates  announcements of regulatory approvals or disapprovals of our drug candidates  including vercirnon and ccx  or delays in any regulatory agency review or approval processes  failure or discontinuation of any of our research programs  announcements relating to future collaborations or our existing collaboration with gsk  general economic conditions in the united states and abroad  acquisitions and sales of new products  technologies or business  delays in the commercialization of any of our drug candidates  market conditions in the pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors  the issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations regarding us  our competitors or our industry in general  actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights  introduction of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  manufacturing issues related to our drug candidates for clinical trials or future products for commercialization  market acceptance of our future products  deviations in our operating results from the estimates of analysts  or other analyst comments  third party payor coverage and reimbursement policies  new legislation in the united states relating to the sale or pricing of pharmaceuticals  fda or other us or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry  product liability claims or other litigation or public concern about the safety of our drug candidates or future drugs  our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property licenses including  if necessary  those relating to vercirnon and other ccr drug candidates  the outcome of any future legal actions to which we are party  sales of our common stock by our officers  directors or significant stockholders  additions or departures of key personnel  and external factors  including natural disasters and other crises 

table of contents in addition  the stock markets in general  and the markets for pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that have been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer 
if any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business 
the ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated  and these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control 
our officers and directors  together with holders of or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  acting as a group  have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction 
the interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
for example  these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company  even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders  which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise 
future sales of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price 
persons who were our stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market  subject in some cases to certain legal restrictions 
if our stockholders or holders of our options or warrants sell  or indicate an intention to sell  substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
approximately  of these shares  and an additional approximately  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants  including warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock that we issued to techne corporation  or techne  in connection with our initial public offering are eligible for sale in the public market  subject to volume limitations under rule under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  with respect to shares held by directors  executive officers and other affiliates 
in addition  shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and rule and rule under the securities act and  in any event  we have filed a registration statement permitting shares of common stock issued on exercise of options to be freely sold in the public market 
if these additional shares of common stock are sold  or if it is perceived that they will be sold  in the public market  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
certain holders of shares of our common stock  warrants to purchase our capital stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of those warrants are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act 
registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act  except for shares purchased by affiliates 
in addition  certain of our directors and executive officers have established  programmed selling plans under rule b of the exchange act  for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock 
any sales of securities by these stockholders  or the perception that those sales may occur  including the entry into such programmed selling plans  could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents if we sell shares of our common stock in future financings  common stockholders may experience immediate dilution and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock 
as a result  our common stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount 
in addition  as opportunities present themselves  we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future  including the issuance of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
for example  in connection with our initial public offering  in february  we issued techne a warrant with a ten year term to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise per share equal to of the initial public offering price of a share of our common stock and such warrant  if exercised  would likely be exercised at a time when the exercise price of such warrant represented a discount to the trading price of our common stock 
if we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock  our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline 
we expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors  including variations in the level of expenses related to our drug candidates or future development programs  if any of our drug candidates receives regulatory approval  the level of underlying demand for these drug candidates and wholesalers buying patterns  addition or termination of clinical trials or funding support  our execution of any collaborative  licensing or similar arrangements  and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements  any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved  regulatory developments affecting our drug candidates or those of our competitors  and our ability to secure new government contracts and allocation of our resources to or away from performing work under government contracts 
if our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
furthermore  any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may  in turn  cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
we have broad discretion in the use of our cash and may not use it effectively 
our management has broad discretion over the use of our cash 
because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of cash  stockholders may not agree with how we allocate or spend our cash 
we may pursue collaborations or clinical trials that do not result in an increase in the market value of our common stock and that may increase our losses  or we may place our cash in investments that do not produce significant investment returns or that may lose value 
our failure to allocate and spend our cash effectively would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business and could cause our stock price to decline 
provisions of our charter documents or delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  and could make it more difficult for our stockholders to change management 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider

overview chemocentryx is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing orally administered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases  inflammatory disorders and cancer 
we currently have six drug candidates in clinical development 
our drug candidates include vercirnon the fda united states adopted name  or usan designation  also known as traficet en  ccx or gsk our most advanced drug candidate targets the chemokine receptor known as ccr and is currently in four pivotal phase iii clinical trials being conducted by our partner gsk for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe crohn s disease  ccx our lead independent drug candidate targets the chemokine receptor known as ccr and is currently in phase ii clinical trials in patients with diabetic nephropathy  a form of kidney disease  ccx gsk an inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as ccr  successfully completed a phase ii proof of concept clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  and was subsequently exclusively licensed to gsk  now solely responsible for further clinical development  ccx targeting the chemoattractant receptor known as car which binds the complement fragment ca  ccx is currently in a phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody  or anca  associated vasculitis  and subject to gsk s option in  if it meets the success criteria established by the jsc  ccx our independent next generation of orally administered inhibitors targeting ccr for expanded indications of renal disease  is currently in phase i clinical development  and ccx our de novo wholly owned next generation ccr inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease and related disorders  is currently in phase i clinical development 
ccx  ccx and ccx are wholly owned and are being developed independently by us  while vercirnon  ccx and ccx are subject to our collaboration agreement with gsk 
in december and november  gsk exercised its options to obtain exclusive licenses for the further development and commercialization of vercirnon and ccx  respectively 
upon exercise of these options  gsk assumed sole responsibility for the further development and commercialization of these drug candidates and each of their two respective back up compounds 
we are also advancing several additional independent drug candidates through preclinical development 
in addition  our strategy has been to identify next generation compounds related to our drug candidates 
all of our drug candidates  including those under our collaboration agreement with gsk  have been internally discovered 
in august  we entered into our strategic alliance with gsk 
we have received over million from gsk  of which approximately million was in the form of equity investments  and the balance from up front and milestone payments  research funding and option exercise fees 
under the terms of our agreement with gsk  we are responsible for the discovery and development of small molecule antagonists targeting four defined chemokine and chemo attractant receptor targets ccr  ccr  car and chemr and for advancing them through clinical proof of concept or to such other success criteria as are established by the jsc 
if we demonstrate the satisfaction of the applicable success criteria  gsk is entitled to options to exclusively license 
table of contents drug candidates that are subject to the collaboration and two defined back up compounds for each drug candidate for further development and commercialization on a worldwide basis 
upon exercising any of its options to drug candidates under the collaboration  gsk is solely responsible for all further clinical development and commercialization expenditures worldwide with respect to that drug candidate and its two designated back up compounds 
in exchange for the rights granted to gsk upon the exercise of its options  we are also entitled to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments  as earned under the terms of our agreement  and royalties on the net sales of licensed drugs 
gsk has already exercised its options to vercirnon ccr and ccx ccr and each of their two respective defined back up compounds and we and gsk determined not to further advance the development of ccx chemr or its two designated back up compounds 
thus  gsk s only remaining option is to ccx car and its associated back up compounds 
if gsk does not exercise its option to ccx  we will evaluate our alternatives for further development of this drug candidate  which may entail internally developing it or identifying other collaboration partners for its development 
since commencing our operations in  our efforts have focused on research  development and the advancement of our drug candidates into and through clinical trials 
as a result  we have incurred significant losses 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of convertible preferred and common stock  contract revenue under our collaborations  government contracts and grants and borrowings under equipment financing arrangements 
in february  we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  pursuant to which we received net proceeds of million  after underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
we also received gross proceeds of million from concurrent private placements of common stock at the ipo price of per share 
in addition  the outstanding principal amount of million and accrued interest under a convertible note we had issued to techne corporation  or techne  one of our principal stockholders  automatically converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our ipo at a conversion price equal to the ipo price 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur net losses as we develop our drug candidates  expand clinical trials for our drug candidates currently in clinical development  expand our research and development activities  expand our systems and facilities  seek regulatory approvals and engage in commercialization preparation activities in anticipation of food and drug administration  or fda  approval of our drug candidates 
in addition  if a product is approved for commercialization  we will need to expand our organization 
significant capital is required to launch a product and many expenses are incurred before revenues are received 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable  if at all 
jobs act in april  the jobs act was enacted 
section of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in section a b of the securities act for implementing new or revised accounting standards 
in other words  an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies 
we have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards  and as a result  we may not implement new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies 
subject to certain conditions set forth in the jobs act  as an emerging growth company  we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions  including without limitation  providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section and implementing any requirement that may be adopted regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements auditor discussion and analysis 
these exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering although if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds million as of any june before that time  we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following december 
table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following critical accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  clinical trial expenses  stock based compensation and our tax net operating loss carryfowards are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we generate revenue principally from collaborative research and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the criteria outlined in the securities and exchange commission s topic and accounting standards codification  or asc  and by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
following these accounting pronouncements  revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
under collaboration agreements  we may receive payments for non refundable up front fees  reimbursement for research and development services  milestone payments and royalties 
in assessing the appropriate revenue recognition related to a collaboration agreement  we first determine whether an arrangement includes multiple elements  such as the delivery of intellectual property rights and research and development services 
intellectual property rights granted under our existing arrangements were not considered to be separable from the activity of providing research and development services because the intellectual property right does not have stand alone value separate from the research and development services provided or evidence of fair value does not exist for the undelivered research and development services 
accordingly  we account for our collaboration agreements as a combined unit of accounting 
the revenue from up front payments is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the research and development obligations covered under the research and development collaboration agreement 
we periodically review the basis for our estimates  and we may change the estimates if circumstances change 
these changes can significantly increase or decrease the amount of revenue recognized 
as we applied our policy to our collaboration arrangements we made judgments which affected the pattern of revenue recognition 
for instance  in our arrangement with gsk  we are obligated to provide research and development services 
we are recognizing revenue over the estimated period of our performance of the research and development services  which was estimated to end in march  the expected completion date of the phase ii clinical trial for the last of the drug candidates to be developed under the gsk alliance 
in we increased our estimate for the remaining estimated research and development period under our arrangement with gsk by approximately years 
this change in estimate was accounted for prospectively and reduced the annualized revenue recognition by approximately million per year 
in february  we and gsk determined not to further advance the development of ccx or its two designated back up compounds and we revised the estimated period of performance prospectively in to end by october this change in estimate was also accounted for prospectively and increased the annualized revenue recognition by approximately million per year 

table of contents in addition to up front payments and research and development funding  we may also be entitled to milestone payments that are contingent upon our achieving a predefined objective 
we follow the milestone method of recognizing revenue from milestones and milestone payments and milestone payments are recorded as revenue in full upon achievement of the milestone if there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and the achievement of the milestone is based on our performance 
clinical trial accruals and related expenses we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties  including clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical investigators  based upon estimates made as of the reporting date of the work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with cros and clinical trial sites 
some cros invoice us on a monthly basis  while others invoice upon milestones achieved and the expense is recorded as services are rendered 
we determine the estimates of clinical activities incurred at the end of each reporting period through discussion with internal personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services  as of the end of each reporting period  pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and cros and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
the significant factors considered in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled and the percentage of work completed to date 
costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in the trials that are paid for in advance are expensed over the estimated set up period 
while the set up periods vary from one arrangement to another  such set up periods generally take from two to six months 
such set up activities include clinical site identification  local ethics committee submissions  regulatory submissions  clinical investigator kick off meetings and pre study site visits 
clinical trial site costs related to patient enrollments are accrued as patients are entered into the trial 
to date  we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of clinical trial accruals after a reporting period 
however  due to the nature of estimates  we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period on a straight line basis 
the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  related to stock option plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of years and years  respectively 
we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future  and to the extent that we do  our actual stock based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 
prior to our ipo  our board of directors  with the assistance of management and independent consultants  performed fair value analyses for the valuation of our common stock 
for grants made on dates for which there was no contemporaneous valuation to utilize in setting the exercise price of our common stock  and given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our ipo in february  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors  including important developments in our operations  most significantly related to the clinical development of our lead drug candidates  vercirnon and ccx  equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock  such as an initial public offering or an acquisition of us  given prevailing market conditions  and that the grants involved illiquid securities in a private company 

table of contents for the options granted subsequent to our february ipo  the exercise price of stock options is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in if not utilized 
we also had net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in if not utilized 
the state research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the portion of the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
results of operations revenue we have not generated any revenue from product sales 
for the three years ended december   our revenue has been derived primarily from contract revenue  up front payments and development milestone payments from gsk 
total revenues  as compared to the prior year  were as follows in thousands year ended december  gsk contract revenue recognition of up front payments milestones total revenues dollar decrease increase percentage decrease increase the decrease in total revenues from to was primarily due to lower milestone revenue in the decrease in revenues from to was primarily due to lower funding of non clinical support from gsk for ccx and the chemr research program in we recorded additional milestone revenues of million for both and relating to activities under the gsk agreement 
no such milestone revenue was recorded in research and development expenses research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct basic research  such as the discovery and development of our understanding of the chemokine system  the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics  such as vercirnon and ccx  the development of our suite of proprietary drug discovery technologies  known collectively as enabalink  which includes our proprietary reverse activation of migration  or ram  screening technology and preclinical studies and clinical trials of our drug candidates 
we expense all research and development expenses as they are incurred 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  including stock based compensation  third party contract costs relating 
table of contents to research  formulation  manufacturing  preclinical study and clinical trial activities  laboratory consumables  and allocated facility costs 
total research and development expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development expenses dollar decrease increase percentage decrease increase the increase in expense from to was primarily due to investing in our lead independent program targeting the chemokine receptor known as ccr  including the advancement of ccx in phase ii studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy and ccx  our second generation ccr inhibitor  into phase i clinical development 
in addition  ccx  our de novo ccr drug candidate  entered phase i clinical development 
these increases were partially offset by lower expenses for ccx following gsk s option exercise to obtain a license to the program  for which they are now solely responsible for further clinical development  along with lower expenses for ccx following the completion of phase i clinical development in february the decrease in expense from to was primarily due to lower research and drug discovery expenses following the advancement of two additional drug candidates into the clinical pipeline as well as the completion of our phase ii clinical trial of ccx in rheumatoid arthritis in we track specific project expenses that are directly attributable to our clinical development candidates and preclinical candidates that have been nominated and selected for further development 
such project specific expenses include third party contract costs relating to formulation  manufacturing  preclinical studies and clinical trial activities 
unlike our early stage research and drug discovery programs  we allocate research and development salaries  benefits or indirect costs to our development candidates and we have included such costs in the project specific expenses 
all remaining research and development expenses are reflected in research and drug discovery which represents early stage drug discovery programs 
such expenses include allocated employee salaries and related benefits  stock based compensation  consulting and contracted services to supplement our in house laboratory activities  laboratory consumables and allocated facility costs associated with these earlier stage programs 
at any given time  we typically have several active early stage research and drug discovery projects 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research or drug discovery project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
as such  we do not maintain information regarding these costs incurred for our early stage research and drug discovery programs on a project specific basis 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses by project in thousands year ended december  development candidate target ccx ccr ccx ccr g ccx ccr de novo ccx cxcr ccx car ccx ccr ccx chemr research and drug discovery total research and development in february  we and gsk determined not to further advance the development of ccx or its two designated back up compounds 

table of contents we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we advance our development programs further and increase the number and size of our clinical trials 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming 
we or our partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our drug candidates 
the probability of success for each drug candidate may be affected by numerous factors  including preclinical data  clinical data  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
for the remaining product option covered under our strategic alliance with gsk  for which we are eligible to receive milestone payments  we are responsible for development of drug candidates through satisfaction of the success criteria mutually agreed upon by the members of the jsc under this strategic alliance  after which time gsk has an option to an exclusive license on a compound by compound basis 
our strategy includes entering into additional partnerships with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our independent drug candidates that are not subject to our alliance with gsk 
most of our product development programs are at an early to mid stage  therefore the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products 
completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to predict for each product 
given the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our drug candidates or if  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our drug candidates 
we anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate  as well as ongoing assessment as to each drug candidate s commercial potential 
we will need to raise additional capital or may seek additional strategic alliances in the future in order to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  including ccx  our lead independent drug candidate 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses were as follows in thousands year ended december  general and administrative expenses dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  including stock based compensation and travel expenses  in executive  finance  business and corporate development and other administrative functions 
other general and administrative expenses include allocated facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  and professional fees for auditing  tax  and legal services 
the increase from to was primarily related to higher stock based compensation expense along with higher costs associated with the first year of operating as a publicly held company 
the increase from to was primarily related to higher professional fees for legal and financial consulting services in connection with intellectual property and business development related activities  respectively 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our operating activities and incur additional costs associated with being a public company 
these public company related increases will likely include legal fees  accounting fees  directors and officers liability insurance premiums and investor relations related fees 

table of contents interest and other income expense interest income expense  primarily consists of interest income earned on our marketable securities and interest expense incurred on our equipment financing obligations and our convertible note 
total interest income expense  net  as compared to prior years was as follows in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense other income  net the increase in interest income from and was primarily due to higher cash and investment balances attributable to the completion of our february ipo and concurrent private placements  pursuant to which we received net proceeds of million 
the increase in interest expense from to was due to interest on and the change in fair value of the million convertible note issued in september other income  net consists primarily of income or expenses which are non recurring in nature 
the increase in other income in was primarily due to million awarded from the united states department of treasury for eight projects under the qualitative therapeutic discovery project program under the patient protection and affordable care act of and the receipt of million for an insurance claim 
income tax benefit provision total income tax benefit provision as compared to prior years was as follows in thousands year ended december  tax benefit provision the company has incurred losses for federal and state income taxes and has concluded that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the total deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments

years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities

we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments as of december  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors  including the achievement of milestones under our agreement with gsk  the terms and timing of any other collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the initiation  progress  timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  the number and characteristics of drug candidates that we pursue  the progress  costs and results of our clinical trials  the outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support continued growth  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims  the cost and timing of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our drug candidates  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to ensure liquidity and to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our marketable securities without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the marketable securities to fluctuate 
to minimize the risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and corporate obligations 
because of the short term maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our marketable securities
