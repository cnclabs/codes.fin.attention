we also dispose of excess and slow moving inventory internally through our full time sales section within our premium retail stores  factory outlets and website 
our apparel is purchased through both domestic importers who procure the merchandise on our behalf and international manufacturers through our direct sourcing program

we have a sourcing office in hong kong to assist with product development and production management  as well as monitoring compliance with our code of conduct and monitoring program

we believe direct sourcing provides us with more control over the production  quality and transportation logistics of our apparel and results in faster speed to market and lower merchandise costs 
domestic importers will remain  however  a crucial component of our overall sourcing strategy  providing unique industry and marketplace knowledge along with product design and development capabilities

risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report  you should carefully consider the following risk factors which could materially affect our business  financial condition or future results of operations 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or deemed immaterial may also adversely affect our business  financial condition  or future results of operations 
we must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences or our sales and results of operations will be adversely affected 
forecasting consumer demand for our merchandise is difficult given the nature of changing fashion trends and consumer preferences 
in addition  our merchandise assortment differs in each seasonal flow and at any given time our assortment may not resonate with our customers 
on average  we begin the design process for apparel nine to ten months before merchandise is available to consumers  and we typically begin to make purchase commitments four to eight months in advance 
these lead times make it difficult for us to respond quickly to changes in demand for our merchandise 
to the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets  our sales will be adversely affected 
if the demand for our merchandise is lower than expected  causing us to hold excess inventory  we would be forced to further discount merchandise  which reduces our gross margins and negatively impacts results of operations and operating cash flows 
if the demand for merchandise is stronger than expected  we may not be able to reorder merchandise on a timely basis to meet demand  which may adversely affect sales and customer satisfaction 
we continue to update our style orientation and reinvigorate our brand  which includes improving the balance of our assortment to address more aspects of our customers lifestyle and rebuilding our under performing categories 
if these changes do not resonate with our customers  our sales  gross margins and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we may be unable to improve the value of our brand and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business 
our success is driven by the value of the coldwater creek brand 
our marketing programs  which include loyalty programs  e commerce platforms and programs  and print media  is designed to improve coldwater creek brand value and to increase traffic to all channels 
the value of our brand is largely dependent on the success of our design  merchandise assortment  and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent  high quality customer experience 
if we are not able to improve our brand perception  we may not fully realize the benefits of improvements to our merchandise assortment and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our secured term loan and credit agreement have restrictions that may limit our ability to fund operations  which could adversely affect our business 
both our secured term loan and credit agreement have covenants that may restrict the manner in which we operate our business 
these covenants  among other things  subject us to capital expenditure limitations  minimum amount of inventory to be held  minimum amount of liquidity and minimum excess availability over the borrowing base that must be maintained  along with various other conditions 
should we fail to comply with the covenants and conditions  we may be unable to fund our operations without a significant restructuring of our business 
we use the revolving line of credit provided under our credit agreement to secure trade letters of credit and  from time to time for borrowings  both of which reduce the amount of available borrowings 
the actual amount that is available under our revolving line of credit fluctuates from time to time  due to factors including  but not limited to  eligible inventory and credit card receivables  reserve amounts  outstanding letters of credit  and borrowing under our revolving line of credit 
consequently  it is possible that  should we need to access any additional funds from our revolving line of credit  it may not be available in full 
as of february   the revolving line of credit was limited to a borrowing base of million with million in letters of credit issued and no borrowings on our revolving line of credit  resulting in million available for borrowing under our revolving line of credit 

table of contents continued material operating losses could adversely impact our liquidity  including our cash  and it may be necessary to seek additional sources of financing  which may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity  including cash and our revolving line of credit that we may continue to draw on from time to time  to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we have had recurring operating losses and if our future operating performance is below our expectations or our revolving line of credit is not fully available to us  our liquidity could be adversely impacted and it may be necessary to seek additional sources of liquidity 
our current level of debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  which could limit our ability to react to changes in our business 
there is no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
we may be unable to successfully realize the benefits of our store optimization program 
we continue to believe that retail expansion will be a key driver for our long term growth 
however  due to our business performance and our focus on improving financial results  in we announced a store optimization program where we expect to close up to premium retail stores through fiscal based on an ongoing review of the performance of our premium retail stores 
to date  we have closed total premium retail stores 
the optimization program is being achieved through a staged approach based primarily on natural lease expirations and early termination rights 
in total  when the program is completed  we expect these actions to generate approximately to million in annualized improvement in pretax operating results 
however  there can be no assurance that the store optimization program will realize the expected benefits and we may incur delays and unexpected costs in its execution 
any miscalculations or shortcomings we may make in the planning and implementation of the store optimization program may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
economic conditions have impacted consumer spending and may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
consumer spending patterns are highly sensitive to the economic climate and consumer spending continues to be impacted by reduced household incomes  high unemployment  and other negative economic conditions  nationally and regionally 
we continue to be affected by challenging macroeconomic conditions which are evidenced in our business by a highly competitive retail selling environment and low retail store traffic 
we believe these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future 
if consumer spending on apparel and accessories continues to decline and demand for our products decreases further  we may be forced to further discount our merchandise or sell it at a loss  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  higher costs for transportation  raw materials  labor  insurance and health care  and other negative economic factors may adversely affect our results of operations 
we have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful 
the success of an individual store location is dependent on the success of the lifestyle center  shopping mall or outlet center where the store is located  and may be influenced by changing customer demographic and consumer spending patterns 
these factors are difficult to predict with accuracy 
because we enter into long term financial commitments when leasing retail store locations and incur substantial fixed costs for each store design  leasehold improvements  fixtures and management information systems  it would be costly for us to close a store that does not prove successful 
the testing of our retail stores long lived assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates can be affected by numerous factors  including changes in economic conditions  our results of operations  and competitive conditions in the industry 
these factors  along with changes in estimates of sales  gross margins  operating earnings and cash flows  may affect the timing and the fair value estimates used in our testing of long lived assets  which may result in impairment charges 
we may be unable to manage the complexities of our multi channel business model  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
the complexity of our multi channel business model requires a level of expertise to successfully manage operations 
as we continue to tightly control expenses  we may experience an increase in demands on our managerial  operational and administrative resources  as well as our control environment 
if we do not manage these demands  we may not realize the full benefits of our multi channel business model  which may adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we operate our distribution function from one facility  which could adversely affect our business if the operations of this facility were severely disrupted 
our single distribution center is located in mineral wells  west virginia  which fulfills merchandise needs for our retail locations and merchandise sold through our direct channel 
any significant disruption to the operations of our distribution center due to natural disasters  accidents  system failures or other unforeseen causes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are subject to significant risks associated with our management information systems  which  if not working properly  could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have a number of complex management information systems that are critical to our operations  including systems such as accounting  human resources  inventory purchasing and management  financial planning  direct segment order processing  and retail segment point of sale systems 
while we regularly evaluate the capabilities and requirements of our information systems  there can be no assurances that our existing information systems will be adequate to support the future needs of our business 
we may have to undertake significant information system implementations  modifications and or upgrades in the future at significant cost to us 
installing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems carries substantial risk  including potential loss of data or information  cost overruns  disruption of operations  lower customer satisfaction  inability to deliver merchandise to our stores or our customers and our potential inability to meet regulatory requirements  any of which would harm our business and may adversely affect our results of operations 
compromises of our data security could adversely affect our results of operations 
in the ordinary course of our business  we collect and store certain personal information from our customers  employees and vendors  and we process customer payments using payment information 
in addition  business is primarily conducted over the internet for our direct segment 
in order to reduce our vulnerability to computer viruses  physical and electronic break ins  and similar disruptions  we have taken steps designed to secure our computer systems  which include network firewalls  two factor authentication and access technology  data encryption  intrusion detection and prevention devices  and the encryption of company laptops 
we also employ secure file transfer options to provide security for processing  transmission and storage of confidential information 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data compromise 
attempts to penetrate our computer system could result in misappropriation of personal information  payment information or confidential business information 
in addition  an employee  contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information  and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information 
we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks 
risks of attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs  including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies  train employees  and engage third party specialists 
any compromise of our data security and loss of personal or business information could disrupt our operations  damage our reputation and customer confidence  and subject us to additional costs and liabilities  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are required to maintain compliance with payment card industry data security standards pci standards  which are common standards for protecting cardholder data 
as part of an overall security program and to meet pci standards  we undergo frequent external vulnerability scans and we are reviewed by a third party security assessor 
as pci standards change  we may be required to implement additional security measures 
failure to maintain compliance could violate agreements with major credit card companies and result in significant fines or a loss of credit processing capabilities 
we depend on key vendors for timely and effective sourcing and delivery of our merchandise 
if these vendors are unable to timely fill orders or meet quality standards  we may lose customer sales and our reputation may suffer 
we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient manufacturing capacity from our vendors 
we generally maintain non exclusive relationships with multiple vendors that manufacture our merchandise 
however  we have no contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products  and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time 
moreover  a key vendor may not be able to supply our inventory needs due to capacity constraints  financial instability  or other factors beyond our control  or we could decide to stop using a vendor due to quality or other issues 
if we were required to change vendors or if a key vendor were unable to supply desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms  particularly in light of current global economic conditions  we could experience delays in filling customer orders or delivering inventory to stores until alternative supply arrangements are secured 
these delays could result in lost sales and a decline in customer satisfaction 
the inability of key vendors to access credit and liquidity  or the insolvency of key vendors  could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise  which could result in lost sales and lower customer satisfaction 
it is also possible that the inability of our vendors to access credit  or concerns vendors or their lenders may have with our creditworthiness  may cause them to extend less favorable terms to us  which could adversely affect our cash flows  margins and financial condition  as well as limit the availability under our revolving line of credit 
additionally  delays by our vendors 
table of contents in supplying our inventory needs could cause us to incur more expensive air freight charges  which may adversely affect our margins 
our reliance on foreign vendors subjects us to uncertainties that could impact our costs to source merchandise  delay or prevent merchandise shipments  which could adversely affect our business 
we continue to source apparel directly from foreign vendors  particularly those located in asia  india and central america 
we were the importer of record for approximately percent of the total apparel units purchased during fiscal irrespective of our direct sourcing from foreign vendors  substantially all of our merchandise  including that which we buy from domestic vendors  is manufactured overseas 
this exposes us to risks and uncertainties which could substantially impact our ability to realize any perceived cost savings 
these risks include  among other things burdens associated with doing business overseas  including the imposition of  or increases in  tariffs or import duties  or import export controls or regulations  as well as credit assurances we are required to provide to foreign vendors  declines in the relative value of the us dollar to foreign currencies  volatile labor  fuel  energy and raw material costs  failure of vendors to adhere to our quality assurance standards  code of conduct and other environmental  labor  health  and safety standards for the benefit of workers  financial instability of a vendor or vendors  including their potential inability to obtain credit to manufacture the merchandise they produce for us  the potential inability of our vendors to meet our production needs due to raw material or labor shortages  changing  uncertain or negative economic conditions  political uncertainties or unrest  or epidemics or other health or weather related events in foreign countries resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  and restrictions on the transfer of funds or transportation delays or interruptions 
we face substantial competition from other retailers in the women apparel industry and if we are unable to compete effectively  our business could be adversely affected 
we face substantial competition from department stores  discount retailers and other specialty retailers in the women apparel industry and our net sales may decline or grow more slowly if we are unable to differentiate our merchandise and shopping experience from those of other retailers 
in addition  the retail apparel industry has experienced significant price deflation over the past several years largely due to the downward pressure on retail prices caused by declining consumer spending  resulting in increased promotional and competitive activity 
this competitive environment may make it more difficult to pass on product cost increases to our customers and to compete with retailers that have greater purchasing power  which may result in lower gross margins 
if we are unable to efficiently fill customer orders in our direct segment  customer satisfaction  our reputation and our business could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to efficiently process and fill customer orders  customers may cancel or refuse to accept orders  and customer satisfaction could be harmed 
we are subject to  among other things failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our customer contact center or our distribution center  including system failures caused by telecommunication system providers  order volumes that exceed our present telephone or internet system capabilities  computer viruses  electrical outages  mechanical problems and human error  delays or failures in the performance of third parties  such as vendors who supply our merchandise  shipping companies and the us postal and customs services  including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  or health epidemics  and disruptions or slowdowns in our order processing or fulfillment systems resulting from increased security measures implemented by us customs or from homeland security measures  fire  natural disasters or comparable events 

table of contents if we experience a greater number of merchandise returns than anticipated  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we make allowances in our financial statements for anticipated merchandise returns based on historical return rates and future expectations 
these allowances may be exceeded  however  by actual merchandise returns as a result of many factors  including changes in the merchandise mix  size and fit  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in catalogs or on the website  timeliness of delivery  competitive offerings and consumer preferences or confidence 
any significant increase in merchandise returns that exceed our estimates would result in adjustments to revenue and to cost of sales and may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to manage significant increases in the costs associated with our catalog business  which could adversely impact our business 
we incur substantial costs associated with catalog mailings  including paper  postage  merchandise acquisition and human resource costs associated with catalog layout and design  production and circulation and increased inventories 
significant increases in us postal service rates and the cost of catalog production could result in lower profits 
most of our catalog related costs are incurred prior to mailing  and as such we are not able to adjust the costs of a particular catalog mailing to reflect the actual subsequent performance of the catalog 
moreover  customer response rates have been volatile in recent years  particularly for mailings to prospective customers 
any performance shortcomings experienced by the catalog business may adversely affect our overall business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
our future success depends largely on the contributions and abilities of our employees 
significant turnover or the loss of key employees may adversely affect our business 
furthermore  the current economic conditions or the location of our corporate headquarters in sandpoint  idaho  may make it more difficult or costly to attract qualified employees 
our multi channel business model may expose us to assessments for unpaid taxes  penalties and interest  which could be substantial 
our multi channel business model subjects us to taxes in numerous jurisdictions  including state and local income  franchise  payroll  and sales and use tax 
we collect and remit these taxes in any jurisdiction in which we have a physical presence 
while we believe we have appropriately paid or accrued for all taxes based on our interpretation of applicable law  tax laws are complex 
in the past  some taxing authorities have assessed additional taxes and penalties on us  asserting either an error in our calculation or an interpretation of the law that differed from our own 
it is possible that taxing authorities may make additional assessments in the future 
in addition to taxes  penalties and interest  these assessments could cause us to incur legal fees associated with resolving disputes with taxing authorities 
additionally  changes in state and local tax laws  such as temporary changes associated with tax holidays and other programs  require us to make continual changes to our collection and reporting systems that may relate to only one taxing jurisdiction 
if we fail to update our collection and reporting systems in response to these changes  any over collection or under collection of taxes could subject us to interest and penalties  as well as private lawsuits and damage to our reputation 
we are subject to potentially adverse outcomes in litigation matters  which could adversely affect our business 
we are  from time to time  involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business 
actions which may be filed against us include commercial  intellectual property infringement  customer and employment claims  including class action lawsuits alleging that we have violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws 
these issues arise primarily in the ordinary course of business but could raise complex factual and legal issues  which are subject to multiple risks and uncertainties and could require significant management time and costs to defend 
we believe that our current litigation issues will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  our assessment of current litigation could change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known to us with respect to pending legal actions  or adverse determinations by judges  juries or other finders of fact 
moreover  additional litigation that is not currently pending may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks from infringement  our business could be adversely affected 
our registered trademarks  which include coldwater creek and other proprietary logos  are important to our success 
even though we register and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights  there is no assurance that our actions will protect us from others infringing upon our trademarks and proprietary rights or seeking to block sales of our products as infringements of their trademarks and proprietary rights 
if we cannot adequately protect our trademarks or prevent infringement of them  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents because the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are concentrated with one financial institution  we may experience losses on our deposits 
we maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents with one major financial institution in the united states  in the form of demand deposits and other short term investments 
deposits in this institution may exceed the amounts of insurance provided on such deposits 
with the current financial environment and the potential instability of financial institutions  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated and will continue to be significantly affected by  among other factors  quarterly operating results  changes in any earnings estimates publicly announced by us or by analysts  customer response to merchandise offerings  timing of retail store openings and closings  and other company announcements 
in addition  stock markets generally have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and market prices for the stock of many companies  including ours  have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to operating performance 
on october   we effected a reverse stock split and our common stock began trading on a post reverse stock split adjusted basis every four shares of common stock outstanding were consolidated into one share 
the reported high and low closing prices as retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split of our common stock during the fiscal year ended february  were per share and per share  respectively 
the current price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 
the fluctuation of the market price of our common stock may have a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity 
changes in the market price of our common stock could considerably affect the valuation of our derivative liability resulting in significant non cash fluctuations in earnings 
in addition  price volatility of our common stock may expose us to stockholder litigation  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

table of contents a on july   we obtained a five year  million senior secured term loan the secured term loan provided by an affiliate of golden gate capital 
in conjunction with the secured term loan  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  which is convertible into up to million shares of our common stock  based upon the initial conversion rate 
the fair value of the series a preferred stock is recorded as a derivative liability and is included in accrued liabilities 
the initial fair value of the series a preferred stock was recorded as a discount to the secured term loan 
changes in the fair value of the derivative liability are recorded as other gain or loss  net  in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive operations 
fiscal results included a million loss on the derivative liability

c net sales for fiscal included million of a cumulative one time adjustment reflecting a change in our estimate of gift card breakage as we began to recognize income from gift card breakage when the likelihood of redemption is considered remote and for the estimated non escheatable amount 
prior to fiscal  we only recognized income from the non escheated portion of unredeemed gift cards after the filing of the corresponding escheatment to the relevant jurisdictions 
d on october   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock 
we received net proceeds from the offering of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
e during fiscal  we recorded a million non cash income tax charge  or per share  related to a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
us gaap requires that we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
current or previous losses are given more weight than projected future performance 
consequently  based on available evidence  in particular our historical cumulative losses  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
the recording of a valuation allowance does not preclude us from utilizing the full amount of the deferred tax asset in future profitable periods

executive summary net sales decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease in net sales was primarily the result of store closures  a decrease in direct segment net sales  and the cumulative one time adjustment for gift card breakage income of million recorded during fiscal  partially offset by an increase in comparable premium retail store sales of percent and the impact of the additional week in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to increased leverage of buying and occupancy costs and improvements in merchandise margins reflecting improved product performance  partially offset by the benefit in fiscal from the cumulative one time adjustment for gift card breakage income 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales  for fiscal the decrease of million in sg a dollars was primarily due to lower marketing expenses 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per share  on million weighted average shares outstanding 
the fiscal net loss includes other loss  net  of million  or per share  due to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability and issuance costs related to the series a preferred stock  and costs associated with the ceo transition  net of tax  of million  or per share  recorded in the fourth quarter 
this compared to a net loss of million  or per share  on million weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal net loss for fiscal included the impact of a cumulative one time adjustment for gift card breakage income of million  or per share  and million of non cash impairment charges  or per share  related to certain retail store assets 
the increase in the number of weighted average shares in fiscal versus the prior year period reflects the sale of million shares of common stock on october  we define comparable premium retail stores as those stores in which the gross square footage has not changed by more than percent in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months without closure for seven consecutive days or moving to a different temporary or permanent location 
due to the extensive promotions that occur as part of the opening of a premium store  we believe waiting months rather than months to consider a store to be comparable provides a better view of the growth pattern of the premium retail store base 
for fiscal  calculation of comparable premium retail store sales excludes the additional week 
the calculation of comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and  as a result  the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation 

table of contents we ended fiscal with million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
this compares to million cash and cash equivalents and million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit at the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal  working capital was million  which reflects the million derivative liability  compared to million at the end of fiscal premium retail store inventory per square foot  including retail inventory in our distribution center  increased percent at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal total inventory decreased percent to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal company initiatives for fiscal  we are focused on the following strategic initiatives our first initiative is to strengthen the coldwater creek brand by continuing to reposition coldwater creek as a leader in the marketplace  providing trend right  age appropriate fashion  and a consistent multi channel experience to our customers 
we have recently completed a comprehensive study of our target customer  which will guide our decision making and enable our organization to execute more consistently 
in merchandising and design  we will continue to build on the base that we established in we will broaden our core product offering by introducing new categories  and evolve our assortment architecture by increasing the penetration of fashion and color  print  and pattern 
we will refine our marketing platform to drive traffic to all channels by leveraging our loyalty program  which was rolled out in fiscal we are focused on adding new loyalty members and increasing the shopping frequency of our current members 
we remain focused on improving our inventory productivity through tighter inventory commitments by adjusting the depth  while maintaining the breadth  in our assortments 
we will continue to execute our real estate optimization program  which we began in fiscal to date we have closed a total of underperforming stores and expect to close an additional stores in fiscal  bringing the total to stores 
we are focused on maximizing transfer sales from closed stores 
as part of our strategy to reduce the average store size over time  we will continue to opportunistically downsize and relocate stores in certain markets 
we will also focus on optimizing our supply chain capabilities  which should enable us to reduce our cycle time and lower our cost of goods 
we plan to reduce our cycle time by streamlining our product development processes  improving our forecasting and planning of capacity and raw materials  and enhancing our overall logistics model 
outlook we have made significant changes to both people and processes over the past few years to enable us to evolve the coldwater creek brand to what customers are looking for today 
we are continuing to see the benefits of these investments in the form of higher margins and meaningful reductions in our year over year losses  which gives us confidence that we are moving in the right direction 
we expect that a competitive promotional environment will continue 
in addition  weakness in consumer spending persists as a result of continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions reflected in reduced household incomes and high unemployment 
we believe these conditions will continue to have a negative impact on our sales  gross margin and operating performance 
we remain committed to disciplined management of expenses and inventory and expect to reduce sg a year over year by million to million in fiscal also  for fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be million to million and depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately million to million 
if we are in a loss position for a quarter or the year  we do not expect to generate any significant federal income tax benefit due to our valuation allowance and we may incur a small expense as a result of various state taxation requirements

seasonality our results of operations and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  on a quarterly basis  as well as on an annual basis  as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following the composition  size and timing of various merchandise offerings  the timing and number of premium retail store openings and closings  the timing and number of promotions  the timing and number of catalog mailings  the ability to accurately estimate and accrue for merchandise returns and the costs of inventory disposition  the timing of merchandise shipping and receiving  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine day  easter  mother day  thanksgiving and christmas  and the day of the week on which certain important holidays fall 
our results continue to depend materially on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of temporary employees to supplement the existing workforce 
liquidity and capital resources overview key measurements of liquidity resources were as follows february  january  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital a current ratio a borrowings under revolving line of credit revolving line of credit availability a the working capital and current ratio as of february  reflect the impact of the million derivative liability 

table of contents we rely on our liquidity resources to fund our operations and use our revolving line of credit to secure trade letters of credit and  from time to time for borrowings  both of which reduce the amount of available borrowings 
the actual amount that is available under our revolving line of credit fluctuates from time to time  due to factors including  but not limited to  eligible inventory and credit card receivables  reserve amounts  outstanding letters of credit  and borrowing under our revolving line of credit 
consequently  it is possible that  should we need to access any additional funds from our revolving line of credit  it may not be available in full 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity  including cash and our revolving line of credit that we may continue to draw on from time to time  to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we have had recurring operating losses and if our future operating performance is below our expectations or our revolving line of credit is not fully available to us  our liquidity could be adversely impacted and it may be necessary to seek additional sources of liquidity 
our current level of debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  which could limit our ability to react to changes in our business 
net cash flow activities were as follows twelve months ended february  january  january  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating cash flows net cash used in operating activities decreased million during fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily as a result of the decrease in net loss  net of non cash activity  partially offset by higher use of cash from operating assets and liabilities 
the higher use of cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the timing of certain payments in relation to our fiscal year end with the additional week during fiscal the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted primarily from the increased net loss offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities principally consisted of cash outflows for capital expenditures which totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  the relocation and remodeling of certain existing stores and the continued development of our technology infrastructure 
financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal primarily reflects proceeds from our new secured term loan with a portion of the proceeds used to pay down our revolving line of credit  the repayment of the separate term loan previously provided by wells fargo bank  and related debt issuance costs 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal were primarily derived from proceeds of million from our stock offering  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  and borrowings on our revolving line of credit and our previous term loan  net of debt issuance costs 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal primarily reflect payments on our capital lease obligations 
secured term loan on july   we obtained a five year  million senior secured term loan the secured term loan provided by an affiliate of golden gate capital 
the secured term loan bears interest at a rate of to be paid in cash quarterly and due and payable in kind pik upon maturity 
the secured term loan is collateralized by a second lien on our inventory and credit card receivables  and a first lien on our remaining assets 
the secured term loan is scheduled to mature upon the earlier of july  or the date that the obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank dated may  the credit agreement mature or are accelerated 
upon maturity of the secured term loan  the principal balance and any unpaid interest  including million of pik interest  will become due and payable 
as of february   million of pik interest has been accrued 
also  on july  in conjunction with the secured term 
table of contents loan  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock and the initial fair value of million was recorded as a discount to the secured term loan 
this discount is being amortized to interest expense based on the effective interest rate method 
credit agreement in may  we entered into the credit agreement with a maturity date of may   which is secured primarily by our inventory  credit card receivables  and certain other assets 
the credit agreement provides a revolving line of credit of up to million  with subfacilities for the issuance of up to million in letters of credit and swingline advances of up to million 
the amount of credit that is available under the revolving line of credit is limited to a borrowing base that is determined according to  among other things  a percentage of the value of eligible inventory and credit card receivables  as reduced by certain reserve amounts required by wells fargo bank 
in conjunction with the closing of the secured term loan  we amended the credit agreement and repaid the separate term loan previously provided by wells fargo bank 
the amendment did not materially change the terms of the credit agreement 
as of february   the revolving line of credit was limited to a borrowing base of million with no borrowings and million in letters of credit issued resulting in million available for borrowing under our revolving line of credit 
pursuant to the credit agreement  borrowings issued under the revolving line of credit will generally accrue interest at a rate ranging from to determined according to the average unused availability under the credit facility the availability over a reference rate of  at our election  either libor or a base rate the reference rate 
letters of credit issued under the revolving line of credit will accrue interest at a rate ranging from to determined according to the availability with an interest rate of as of february  commitment fees accrue at a rate ranging from to determined according to the availability  which is assessed on the average unused portion of the credit facility maximum amount 
debt covenants both the secured term loan and credit agreement have restrictive covenants that subject us to capital expenditure limitations based on our approved annual plan  maintaining a minimum of million of inventory  and maintaining a minimum of million of liquidity and a minimum excess availability of percent of our borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement 
the secured term loan and credit agreement also contain various covenants relating to customary matters  such as indebtedness  liens  investments  acquisitions  mergers  dispositions  dividends  and other various conditions 
our current plan to close up to stores under our store optimization program and the related transfer or disposition of store assets is not limited by our secured term loan or credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all covenants for all periods presented 
both the secured term loan and credit agreement contain customary events of default 
upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods  in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders  the obligations may be accelerated  outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral 
capital and real estate plans capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between million and million 
we currently plan to limit new store openings to two factory outlet stores in fiscal and will continue to take advantage of real estate opportunities to improve the efficiency of our store base  including relocating stores to more favorable locations and reducing overall store size 
in fiscal  we announced a store optimization program where we expect to close up to stores through fiscal to date  we have closed premium retail stores 
the optimization program is being achieved through a staged approach based primarily on natural lease expirations and early termination rights 
in total  when the program is completed  we expect these actions to generate approximately million to million in annualized improvement in pretax operating results 
we typically do not incur significant termination costs or disposal charges as a result of store closures 
early termination clauses generally relieve us of any future obligation under a lease if specified sales levels or certain occupancy targets are not achieved by a specified date

the operating lease obligations noted above do not include any of these adjustments or payments made for maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
several lease agreements provide renewal options or allow for termination rights under certain circumstances 
future operating lease obligations would change if these renewal options or termination rights were exercised 
b contractual commitments include commitments to purchase inventory of million and capital expenditures of million 
the timing of the payments is subject to change based upon actual receipt of the inventory or capital asset and the terms of payment with the vendor 
c upon maturity of the secured term loan  million of pik interest will become due and payable

critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as a result  actual results could differ because of the use of estimates 
note significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  as described below  include those that require us to make estimates about matters that are uncertain and could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sales returns we recognize sales and the related cost of sales for our direct segment at the time the merchandise is expected to be delivered to our customer and for our retail segment at the point of sale with a customer in a store 
we reduce our sales and cost of sales and establish an accrual for expected sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations 
the actual amount of sales returns we subsequently realize may fluctuate from estimates due to several factors  including size and fit  merchandise mix  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in the catalog or website  timeliness of delivery and competitive offerings 
we continually track subsequent sales return experience  compile customer feedback to identify any pervasive issues  reassess the marketplace  compare our findings to previous estimates and adjust the accrual accordingly 
provisions for sales returns were as follows fiscal year ended february  january  january  in thousands provision for sales returns beginning of period additions charged to income deductions for actual returns adjustments recorded to income provision for sales returns end of period gift card breakage proceeds from the sale of gift cards and certificates are recorded as a liability and are recognized as net sales when the cards are redeemed for merchandise 
our gift cards do not have an expiration date 
during fiscal  we identified a history of redemption patterns associated with our gift cards that support a change in our estimate of the term over which we should recognize income on gift card breakage 
based on historical information  the likelihood of a gift card remaining unredeemed can be reasonably estimated at the time of gift card issuance 
breakage income is recognized over the estimated average redemption period of redeemed gift cards  for those gift cards for which the likelihood of redemption is deemed to be remote and for the amount for which there is no legal obligation for us to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to any relevant jurisdictions 
during fiscal  we recorded million of a cumulative one time adjustment reflecting the change in our estimate of gift card breakage 
during fiscal  gift card breakage income was million 
inventory adjustments our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
the nature of our business requires that we make substantially all of our merchandising decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings 
these decisions and commitments are based upon  among other possible considerations  historical sales with identical or similar merchandise  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  and an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually make assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value  and  if so  by what dollar amount 
to determine whether inventory should be written down we consider current and anticipated demand and customer preferences in addition to the current and future estimated selling price 
the carrying value of the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to cost of sales 
actual results may differ from our estimates if we are required to markdown or discount merchandise beyond our current expectations 
for the inventory marked down to net realizable value  a one percentage point increase in our adjustment rate at february  would have affected net loss by less than million 
we estimate and record physical inventory losses that have occurred since our last physical inventory date by applying the most recent average physical inventory loss experience 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss estimate 
however  if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
stock based compensation the calculation of stock based compensation expense requires us to expense the fair value of equity awards over the requisite employee service period  which is generally the vesting period 
calculating the fair value of stock options on the date of grant requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life and pre vesting forfeitures 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon a combination of both the 
table of contents implied and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
an increase in expected volatility or expected life would result in an increase in the fair value of our stock options and higher compensation expense  while a decrease in expected volatility or expected life would result in a decrease in the fair value of our stock options and lower compensation expense 
we also grant various restricted stock units which are generally less subjective in determining fair value as the fair value of these awards is based primarily upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate forfeitures for all of our equity awards based upon historical experience  and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
we revise our estimated forfeitures in subsequent periods  when necessary  if actual forfeitures vary from those originally estimated 
we believe that our estimates are based upon outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  compensation expense would vary from what we record in the current and prior fiscal years 
total stock based compensation expense during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million  and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  we then determine the fair value of the asset generally by using a discounted cash flow model 
a loss is recognized  if any  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value 
in assessing future cash flows  management makes certain significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically for retail store asset groups reviewed for impairment  these assumptions and judgments may include projected sales  margins and operating expenses over the estimated remaining useful life 
these assumptions and judgments can be affected by consumer spending and overall economic conditions on a localized or regional basis  as well as other factors not necessarily within our control 
during fiscal  based on our review of the operating results for each of our stores  we evaluated certain store assets for impairment but did not record an impairment charge 
derivative liability on july   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock in conjunction with the secured term loan  which is convertible up to million shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share of underlying common stock 
the fair value of the series a preferred stock at issuance was million  which was recorded as a derivative liability and is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the black scholes option valuation model  which is significantly dependent on the market price of our common stock 
changes in the fair value are recorded as gain or loss  net  in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive operations 
as of february   the derivative liability was million  resulting in a million loss on the derivative liability for the fiscal year ended a percent increase decrease in the closing price of our common stock at february   in isolation of the impact to the volatility assumption  would have increased decreased the fair value of the derivative liability by approximately million 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management best assessment of estimated taxes to be paid 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  as measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the periods where temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled 
changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
we consider all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that existing deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
current or previous losses are given more weight than projected future performance 
consequently  based on all available evidence  in particular our three year cumulative loss  we have a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets 
the determination of when to reduce a valuation allowance requires significant judgment by management in determining the appropriate level of evidence to objectively support the realization of the net deferred tax assets 
when the results of our operations demonstrate a sustained level of taxable income it may result in the reduction of the valuation allowance 

table of contents the valuation allowance activity on net deferred tax assets was as follows fiscal year ended february  january  january  in thousands valuation allowance beginning of period net additions charged to income tax expense valuation allowance end of period contingencies an estimated loss from a contingency is recorded if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
we are involved in litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
actions filed against us from time to time include commercial  intellectual property infringement  customer and employment claims  including class action lawsuits alleging that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws 
the assessment of the outcome of litigation can be very difficult to predict as it is subject to many factors  including those not within our control  and is highly dependent on individual facts and circumstances 
litigation is subject to highly complex legal processes and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been recorded in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and the market price of our common stock 
we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollars or us dollar based currencies 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
our secured term loan bears interest at a fixed rate and would not be affected by interest rate changes 
future borrowings under our revolving line of credit would be affected by interest rate changes 
the derivative liability  representing shares of series a preferred stock  is measured at fair value using the black scholes option valuation model  which is significantly dependent on the market price of our common stock 
changes in the fair value are recorded as gain or loss  net  in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive operations 
a percent increase decrease in the closing price of our common stock at february   in isolation of the impact to the volatility assumption  would have increased decreased the fair value of the derivative liability by approximately million
