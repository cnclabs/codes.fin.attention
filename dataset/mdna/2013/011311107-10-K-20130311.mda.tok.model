 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu will require the company to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the new guidance is effective for the company interim period ending march  the disclosures required are to be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
the company does not expect that this guidance will have an impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature

the conflict mineral rules cover minerals frequently used to manufacture a wide array of electronic and industrial products including semiconductor devices 
the rules do not ban the use of minerals from conflict sources  but require public disclosure beginning with calendar year we have determined that we are subject to the rules and are evaluating our supply chain and continue to develop processes to assess the impacts and comply with the regulation 
in july  the fasb amended its guidance to simplify how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment becomes effective for the company interim period ending march  and early adoption is permitted 
we have elected to adopt this guidance for the year ended december  and this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected 
for all other customers  it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions 
the company evaluates all receivables that are over days old and will reserve specifically on a day basis 
the company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases 
this allows the company  in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy  to repossess its inventory 
this also allows alamo group to maintain only a reserve over its cost  which usually represents the margin on the original sales price 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  on december   and  on december  the decrease was mainly from the company s agricultural division 
sales discounts on december   the company had  in reserves for sales discounts compared to  on december  on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs 
the increase was due primarily to increased sales volume of the company s agricultural products during the pre season  which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of the company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time 
the company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program 
historically  between and of the company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available 
inventories obsolete and slow moving the company had a reserve of  on december  and  on december  to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the increase in the reserve was mainly from the us agricultural division and the european division  specifically its french operations 
the obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows no inventory usage over a three year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at percent  and slow moving inventory with little usage requires a percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three year supply 
there are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the company  based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification 
in cases where there is no historical data  management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves  if any  are appropriate 
new products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three year history has been established 
the reserve is reviewed and  if necessary  adjustments are made on a quarterly basis 
the company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve 
the company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated 
warranty the company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and days on parts though some components can have warranty for longer terms 
warranty reserve  as a percentage of sales  is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety day to six month lag period 
the company s historical experience is that an end user takes approximately days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim 
a warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group 
reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required 
the current liability warranty reserve balance was  on december  and  on december  the decrease was mainly from the company s industrial division 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually  at the reporting unit level  and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two step process 
we have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit goodwill for impairment 
if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value  no further evaluation is necessary 
for reporting units where we perform the two step process  the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit  which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows  to the respective carrying value  which includes goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  the goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this analysis requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty 
the company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios  which require the company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses 
as of december   goodwill was  which represents of total assets 
the company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its french operations  faucheux of  in and at two of its french operations  sma and rousseau of  in and no goodwill impairment in the primary reason for the goodwill impairment in and was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the company european operations 
this caused the company to revise its expectations about future revenue  which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the company reporting units 
during the impairment analysis review  it was noted that even though the schwarze and rivard reporting unit fair value was above carrying value  it was not materially different 
on december   there was approximately million and million of goodwill related to the schwarze and rivard reporting units  respectively 
these reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the company s assumptions and estimates 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates  discount rates  etc 
management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the company components 
however  management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future 
for example  if discount rates demanded by the market increase  this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach 
if the company projections are not achieved in the future  this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach 
if the market price of the company stock decreases  this could cause the company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium  which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations 
if future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past  this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach 
and finally  if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the company components  this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach 
the company annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty  the fair value of the company components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods 
the company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates  attrition of key personnel  volatility in the capital markets  the company market capitalization compared to its book value  the company recent operating performance  and the company financial projections 
the occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing  which could result in future impairment charges 
in particular  since the schwarze and rivard  reporting unit carrying value is not materially different from fair value  any changes to the company assumptions could lead to an indicated impairment in step one  requiring the company to proceed to step two and potentially record an impairment charge

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various financial market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk international sales a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions 
the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  the uk  france  canada and australia 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financials  specifically the value of its foreign assets  could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the company distribute their products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company s uk subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge over of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had  outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
on december   the fair value of these agreements was in an unfavorable position  therefore  the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a loss of  which has been recognized in other income expense  net 
exposure to exchange rates the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominantly in european countries  canada and australia  as a result of the sale of its products in international markets 
foreign currency forward contracts in the uk are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
on december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of  comparatively  on december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the translation adjustment during was a loss of  
on december   the british pound closed at relative to the us dollar  and the euro closed at relative to the us dollar 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at relative to the us dollar  and the euro closed at relative to the us dollar 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the average level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
however  challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty
