item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap with certain non gaap financial measures  including percentage sales growth in constant currency  adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share 
we believe that these non gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance 
management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency  adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses 
management uses these non gaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non gaap financial measures 
to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency  we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales 
percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates 
to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis  we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings 
because non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names 
these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth  net earnings and diluted net earnings per share  the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below  provide a more complete understanding of our business 
we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

acquisitions 
acquisitions used of cash in and  in cash used in was primarily for the acquisition of surpass medical for as well as for milestone payments associated with previous acquisitions 
cash used in was primarily for the acquisitions of neurovascular for  orthovita for  memometal for  and concentric for capital spending 
we manage capital spending to support our business growth 
capital expenditures  primarily to support integration of acquisitions  capacity expansion  new product introductions  innovation and cost savings  were in and in proceeds from asset sales 
proceeds from asset sales contributed to cash in  primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the op product family 
financing activities dividend payments 
dividends paid per common share increased to per share in total dividend payments to common shareholders were in and in the increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividend from per share in to per share in long term and short term debt 
we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors  including cash flow expectations  cash requirements for ongoing operations  investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and overall cost of capital 
in september we sold of unsecured notes due september the net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  stock repurchases and other business opportunities 
total debt was  in and  in share repurchases 
the total use of cash for share repurchases was in and in liquidity our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  at december  and  at december  and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by  at december  and  at december  we anticipate being able to support our short term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations 
we have also raised funds in the past in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time 
we have strong short and long term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due 
in august we refinanced our credit facility with a new  unsecured revolving credit facility due august facility 
the facility replaced the previously outstanding  unsecured credit facility that would have become due in august the facility includes an increase option permitting us to increase the size of the facility up to an additional  a multicurrency sublimit with no sublimit for euro borrowings and a letter of credit sublimit 
the facility has an dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified annual facility fee ranging from to basis points and bears interest at libor  as defined in the facility agreement  plus an applicable margin ranging from to basis points  both of which are dependent on our credit ratings 
should additional funds be required we had approximately  of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at december   including the facility 
in february of we made a voluntary general offer to acquire trauson holdings company limited  a leading manufacturer of trauma and spine products in china 
in connection with this offer  we have restricted of our available borrowing capacity until the completion of the tender offer 
the transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of at december   approximately of our consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the united states 
these funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states 
several european countries  including spain  portugal  italy and greece the southern european region  have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal conditions 
we continuously monitor our investment portfolio for exposures to the european debt crisis 
we currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the southern european region 
any non sovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial 
we continually evaluate our receivables  particularly in the southern european region 
the total net receivables from the southern european region were approximately and at december  and  respectively  including approximately and  respectively  of sovereign receivables 
we believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the european debt crisis is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity 
guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
contractual obligations and forward looking cash requirements as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by  of which approximately related to plans outside the united states 
due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions in the jurisdictions the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance  changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods  beyond  in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december  we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits  we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 
our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year  including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business  are payment period after total short term and long term debt unconditional purchase obligations operating leases contributions to defined benefit plans other critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap  there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application 
these include allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  income taxes  acquisitions  goodwill and intangible assets  and legal and other contingencies 
we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes our annual tax rate is determined based on our income  statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are recorded in the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary and reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments 
in certain of these jurisdictions  we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 
we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  and adjust them accordingly 
we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions 
although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain  based on currently available information  we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision  certain changes or future events  such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans  could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 
acquisitions  goodwill and intangibles  and long lived assets we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition 
in addition  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values  with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives 
accordingly  we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialists for significant items 
the fair value estimates are dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 
we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets  which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets 
significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability  the underlying product or technology life cycles  the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows 
unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
the majority of our acquired intangible assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives 
our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment  market share  trademark and or brand history  underlying product life cycles  operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold 
our estimates of the useful lives of determinable lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors 
determinable lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life 
in certain of our acquisitions  we acquire in process research and development iprd intangible assets 
iprd is considered to be an indefinite lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed at which time it becomes a determinable lived intangible asset or determined to have no future use at which time it is impaired 
the value of indefinite lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year 
we have adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill 
in certain circumstances  we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability 
in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level 
we test individual indefinite lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 
we did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented  as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values 
future changes in the judgments  assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections  could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values 
a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements 
we review long lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level 
the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique 
assets classified as held for sale  if any  are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
legal and other contingencies we are involved in various ongoing proceedings  legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business  including proceedings related to product  labor and intellectual property  and other matters that are more fully described in other information below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in certain of the legal proceedings  the claimants seek damages  as well as other compensatory and dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified equitable relief  that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief 
for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations  a liability representing management best estimate of the probable loss  or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known  for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded 
the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel  previous settlement experience and settlement strategies 
if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be incurred  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters  we purchase third party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations 
future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried 
in addition  such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost effective third party insurance coverage in future periods 
new accounting pronouncements no accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other information hedging and derivative financial instruments we sell our products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar  european currencies  in particular the euro  swiss franc and the british pound  the japanese yen  the australian dollar and the canadian dollar 
we develop and manufacture products in the united states  china  france  germany  ireland  puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period  with resulting gains losses included in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december  fair value by approximately we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts  but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties 
we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged 
these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders equity by  to from as of december  legal and regulatory matters on june  we voluntarily recalled our rejuvenate and abg ii modular neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products 
we notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall  which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions 
product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us 
as previously announced  we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services  including any necessary revision surgeries 
we continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs 
the ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the limited information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services  the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries  the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us  and the amount of third party insurance recoveries 
based on the information that has been received  we estimate the probable loss to resolve this matter to be in the range of approximately to  before third party insurance recoveries 
accordingly  in december we recorded a charge to earnings of representing the excess of the minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves 
no contingent gain dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified for third party recoveries was recorded as of december  as noted above  the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict 
the ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice doj related to the sales and marketing of the otisknee device 
the subpoena concerns allegations of violations of federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the united states food and drug administration fda 
we entered into discussions with the doj regarding the potential resolution of this matter and  in the second quarter of we recorded a non tax deductible charge of for this matter 
we continue to discuss this matter with the doj  but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts
