item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of egain s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview egain was incorporated in delaware in september we are a leading provider of cloud based and on site customer engagement solutions 
for over a decade  our solutions have helped improve customer experience  grow sales  and optimize service processes across the web  social  and phone channels 
hundreds of global enterprises rely on us to transform fragmented sales engagement and customer service operations into unified customer engagement hubs 
in fiscal year  we recorded annual revenue of million and income from operations of million  compared to annual revenue of million and loss from operations of million in fiscal year the year over year increase in total revenue was primarily driven by the increase of in subscription revenue as our business has shifted more toward a cloud delivery model 
subscription and support revenue was million in fiscal year  an increase of from fiscal year professional services revenue was million in fiscal year  an increase of from fiscal year cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year  compared to cash provided by operations of million for fiscal year based upon the strong increase in the demand for our products and services we continued to increase our investment in sales and marketing and expand our distribution capability during fiscal year if the demand continues for our products and services  we intend to continue to increase our sales and marketing investments and the expansion of distribution capability in fiscal year in addition  we intend to make further investments in product development and technology to enhance our current products and services  develop new products and services and further advance our solution offerings 
we believe that existing capital resources will enable us to maintain current and planned operations for the next months 
due to fluctuations in our business  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance  but we anticipate an increase in revenue in fiscal year unbilled deferred revenue unbilled deferred revenue represents business that is contracted but not yet invoiced or collected and off balance sheet and  accordingly  is not recorded in deferred revenue 
as such  the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable subscription agreements 
as of june   unbilled deferred revenue increased to million  up from approximately million as of june  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  deferred tax valuation allowance and accrued liabilities  long lived assets and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
voluntary change in accounting policy for sales commissions on july   we made a voluntary change to our accounting policy for sales commissions related to new cloud contracts with customers  from recording an expense when incurred to deferral and amortization of the sales commission in proportion to the revenue recognized over the term of the contract 
we believe this method is preferable because commission charges that are direct and incremental are so closely related to the revenue from the contracts that they should be deferred and charged to expense over the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
furthermore  it is our belief that most industry peers have adopted a similar commission expense policy 
as a result  we believe this change should improve the comparability of our consolidated financial statements to our industry peers and provide better matching of our revenue and expenses 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements to deliver multiple products or services multiple elements 
we apply software revenue recognition rules and multiple elements arrangement revenue guidance 
significant management judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes to the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
we present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
we derive revenue from three sources i subscription and support fees primarily consist of cloud revenue from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services  term license revenue  and maintenance and support revenue  ii license fees primarily consist of perpetual software license revenue  iii professional services primarily consist of consulting  implementation services and training 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists evidence of an arrangement consists of a written contract signed by both the customer and management prior to the end of the period 
we use signed software license  services agreements and order forms as evidence of an arrangement for sales of software  cloud  maintenance and support 
we use a signed statement of work as evidence of arrangement for professional services 
delivery or performance has occurred software is delivered to customers electronically or on a cd rom  and license files are delivered electronically 
delivery is considered to have occurred when we provide the customer access to the software along with login credentials 
fees are fixed or determinable we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
arrangements where a significant portion of the fee is due beyond days from delivery are generally not considered to be fixed or determinable 
collectibility is probable we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
payment terms generally range from to days from invoice date 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
we apply the provisions of accounting standards codification  or asc   software revenue recognition  to all transactions involving the licensing of software products 
in the event of a multiple element arrangement for a license transaction  we evaluate the transaction as if each element represents a separate unit of accounting taking into account all factors following the accounting standards 
we apply asc  revenue recognition  for cloud transactions to determine the accounting treatment for multiple elements 
we also apply asc for fixed fee arrangements in which we use the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the implementation services 
when such estimates are not available  the completed contract method is utilized 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized only when a contract is completed or substantially complete 
when licenses are sold together with system implementation and consulting services  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that i payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting and implementation services  ii the services are available from other vendors  iii the services qualify for separate accounting as we have sufficient experience in providing such services  have the ability to estimate cost of providing such services  and we have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value  and iv the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include subscription  maintenance and support  and professional services 
we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting  as defined by asc  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements  ii the element has stand alone value to the customer  and iii there is a general right of return 
we use vsoe  of fair value for each of those units  when available 
for revenue recognition with multiple deliverable elements  in certain limited circumstances when vsoe of fair value does not exist  we apply the selling price hierarchy  which includes vsoe  third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  and best estimate of selling price  or besp 
we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vsoe  if available  or its besp  if vsoe is not available 
we determined that tpe is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third party pricing information 
we determine besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions 
significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices  the size and volume of our transactions  the customer demographic  the geographic area where services are sold  price lists  its go to market strategy  historical standalone sales and contract prices 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by our management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify its pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in relative selling prices  including both vsoe and besp 
subscription and support revenue cloud revenue cloud revenue consists of subscription fees from customers accessing our cloud based service offerings 
we recognize cloud revenue ratably over the period of the applicable agreement as services are provided 
cloud agreements typically have an initial term of one or two years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement 
the majority of the cloud services customers purchase a combination of our cloud service and professional services 
in some cases  the customer may also acquire a license for our software 
we consider the applicability of asc  on a contract by contract basis 
in cloud based agreements  where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software  the revenue is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract 
invoiced amounts are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we consider a software element to exist when we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the cloud period without significant penalty and can feasibly run the software on its own hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software 
additionally  we have established vsoe for the cloud and maintenance and support elements of perpetual license sales  based on the prices charged when sold separately and substantive renewal terms 
accordingly  when a software element exists in a cloud services arrangement  license revenue for the perpetual software license element is determined using the residual method and is recognized upon delivery 
revenue for the cloud and maintenance and support elements is recognized ratably over the contractual time period 
professional services are recognized as described below under professional services revenue 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of an agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the period that these elements are delivered 
term license revenue term license revenue includes arrangements where our customers receive license rights to use our software along with bundled maintenance and support services for the term of the contract 
the majority of our contracts provide customers with the right to use one or more products up to a specific license capacity 
certain of our license agreements stipulate that customers can exceed pre determined base capacity levels  in which case additional fees are specified in the license agreement 
term license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license contract 
maintenance and support revenue maintenance and support revenue consists of customers purchasing maintenance and support for our on premise software 
we use vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support to account for the arrangement using the residual method  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically one year 
maintenance and support is renewable by the customer on an annual basis 
maintenance and support rates  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
license revenue license revenue includes perpetual license rights sold to customers to use our software in conjunction with related maintenance and support services if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we use the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
the residual amount of revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of software maintenance and support  implementation and consulting services and in some cases cloud services 
we periodically sell to resellers 
license sales to resellers as a percentage of total revenue were approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue from sales to resellers is generally recognized upon delivery to the reseller dependent on the facts and circumstances of the transaction 
these include items such as our understanding of the reseller s plans to sell the software  existence of return provisions  price protection or other allowances  the reseller s financial status and our past experience with the reseller 
historically sales to resellers have not included any return provisions  price protections or other allowances 
professional services revenue included in professional services revenue is revenue derived from system implementation  consulting and training 
for license transactions  the majority of our consulting and implementation services qualify for separate accounting 
we use vsoe of fair value for the services to account for the arrangement using the residual method  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
our consulting and implementation service contracts are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
substantially all of our contracts are on a time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  where the services are not essential to the functionality  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
if the services are essential to functionality  then both the product license revenue and the service revenue are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
for a fixed fee contract  we recognize revenue based upon the costs and efforts to complete the services in accordance with the percentage of completion method  provided we are able to estimate such cost and efforts 
we recognize the services revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer cloud relationship once cloud services have gone live or are system ready for cloud  consulting  and implementation services that do not qualify for separate accounting 
we currently estimate the life of the customer cloud relationship to be approximately months  based on the average life of all cloud customer relationships 
training revenue that meets the criteria to be accounted for separately is recognized when training is provided 
deferred revenue deferred revenue primarily consists of payments received in advance of revenue recognition from cloud  term license  and maintenance and support services and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments 
the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable cloud or maintenance and support agreements 
deferred revenue is influenced by several factors  including seasonality  the compounding effects of renewals  invoice duration  invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter 
deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 
in june   deferred revenue increased to million  compared to million at june  deferred commissions deferred commissions are the direct and incremental costs directly associated with cloud contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions to our direct sales force 
the commissions are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related customer contracts  which are typically one or two years 
the commission payments are paid based on contract terms in the month following the quarter in which the commissions are earned 
the deferred commission amounts are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the terms of the related customer contracts  in proportion to the recognition of the associated revenue 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of the stock based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes valuation assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives 
we determine the appropriate measure of expected volatility by reviewing historic volatility in the share price of our common stock  as adjusted for certain events that management deems to be non recurring and non indicative of future events 
we base our estimate of expected life on the historical exercise behavior  cancellations of all past option grants made by us during the time period in which our equity shares have been publicly traded  the contractual term  the vesting period and the expected remaining term of the option 
based on our historical experience of option pre vesting cancellations  we have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for our options 
we record additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than we estimated  and record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than what we estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill annually for impairment or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
in addition  we evaluate purchased intangible assets to determine that all such assets have determinable lives 
we operate under a single reporting unit and accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we performed annual impairment reviews for fiscal years  and and found no impairment 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit to customers on a regular basis 
our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers and are not interest bearing 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables 
we review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues 
we exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends  general economic conditions in the us and internationally  and changes in customer financial conditions 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  then material differences may result in additional reserves for trade receivables  which would be reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for any period presented 
we write off a receivable after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the amount is deemed uncollectible 
leases lease agreements are evaluated to determine whether they are capital or operating leases in accordance with asc  leases 
when any one of the four test criteria in asc is met  the lease then qualifies as a capital lease 
capital leases are capitalized at the lower of the net present value of the total amount payable under the leasing agreement excluding finance charges or the fair market value of the leased asset 
capital lease assets are depreciated on a straight line basis  over a period consistent with our normal depreciation policy for tangible fixed assets  but not exceeding the lease term 
interest charges are expensed over the period of the lease in relation to the carrying value of the capital lease obligation 
rent expense for operating leases  which may include free rent or fixed escalation amounts in addition to minimum lease payments  is recognized on a straight line basis over the duration of each lease term 
deferred tax valuation allowance when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of june   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million of which approximately million was attributable to us and state net operating losses and research and development credit carry forwards 
we apply asc  income taxes  in determining any uncertain tax positions 
the guidance seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under asc  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income and expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt  including related party debt 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
we believe the reported carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value  based upon their short term nature and comparable market information available at the respective balance sheet dates 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percent of total revenue for the periods indicated 
revenue subscription and support license professional services total revenue cost of subscription and support cost of license cost of professional services total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations revenue total revenue  which consists of subscription and support  license and professional services revenue  was million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
in fiscal year  total revenue increased  or million  from the prior year 
our international sales accounted for approximately of total revenue in fiscal year  a decrease from of total revenue in fiscal year the impact of the foreign exchange fluctuation between the us dollar  the euro and british pound in total revenue was minimal in both fiscal year and there was one customer that accounted for of total revenue in fiscal year and two different customers that accounted for and of total revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
we are continuing to see increased interest in our customer engagement solutions but a general unpredictability remains in the length of our current sales cycles  the timing of revenue recognition on more complex license transactions  and seasonal buying patterns 
this unpredictability has increased due to the global economic and business condition and the currency exchange rate fluctuations of the british pound and euro in relation to the us dollar 
also  because we offer a hybrid delivery model  the mix of new cloud and license transactions in a quarter could affect our revenue in a particular quarter 
we are continuing to see the perpetual license business shift toward a cloud delivery model 
the value of new cloud transactions  as a percentage of combined new cloud  new license  and maintenance and support business  was approximately and for the fiscal years and  respectively 
for license transactions  the license revenue amount is generally recognized in the quarter that delivery and acceptance of our software takes place 
for cloud transactions  cloud revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the cloud contract  which is typically one to two years 
as a result  our total revenue may increase or decrease in future quarters as a result of the timing and mix of license and cloud transactions  but we anticipate total revenue to increase in fiscal year subscription and support revenue fiscal year ended june year over year change to to in thousands revenue cloud maintenance and support total subscription and support revenue percentage of total revenue subscription and support revenue includes cloud and software maintenance and support revenue 
subscription and support revenue was million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively

cloud revenue was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
this represented an increase of  or million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and an increase to  or million  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to the continued shift from license to our cloud model 
the increase in new cloud contracts with current enterprise customers included two new cloud contracts totaling approximately million that are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
the impact from the foreign currency fluctuations on cloud revenue was minimal in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to the shift from license to our cloud model 
the increase in new cloud contracts with current enterprise customers included six new cloud contracts totaling approximately million that are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
the impact from the foreign currency fluctuations on cloud revenue was minimal in fiscal year excluding the impact from any further foreign currency fluctuations  we expect cloud revenue to increase in fiscal year based upon current renewal rates for existing cloud customers and the projected levels of new cloud agreements 
maintenance and support revenue consists of technical support and software upgrades and enhancements 
maintenance and support revenue was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
this represented an increase of  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and an increase of  or million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year excluding the impact from any future foreign currency fluctuation  we expect maintenance and support revenue to increase or remain relatively constant in fiscal year based upon the current renewal rates for existing maintenance and support customers and the projected levels of new license sales 
license revenue fiscal year ended june year over year change to to in thousands revenue license percentage of total revenue license revenue was million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively

new license and support transactions in fiscal year included approximately million from five transactions with an average deal size of million 
the increase in license revenue is primarily attributable to increased demand from new and existing customers 
the impact from the foreign currency fluctuations on license revenue was minimal in fiscal year new license and support transactions in fiscal year included approximately million from five transactions with an average deal size of million 
the decrease in license revenue is primarily attributable to a shift to the cloud delivery model in fiscal year the impact from the foreign currency fluctuations on license revenue was minimal in fiscal year given the general unpredictability in the length of current sales cycles  the mix between cloud and license transactions  the uncertainty in the global economy and the volatility of the value of the british pound and euro in relation to the us dollar  license revenue may increase or decrease in future periods  but we anticipate total license revenue to increase in fiscal year professional services revenue fiscal year ended june year over year change to to in thousands revenue professional services percentage of total revenue professional services revenue was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
this represented an increase of  or million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and an increase of  or million  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in demand for our services and increase in managed customers who migrated from on premise to the cloud 
the impact from the foreign currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound on professional services revenue was an increase of  in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in demand for professional service activities such as system implementation  consulting and training 
the impact from the foreign currency fluctuations on professional services revenue was minimal in fiscal year excluding the impact from any future foreign currency fluctuations  we expect professional services revenue to increase or remain relatively constant in fiscal year based upon our current sales pipeline and current sales trend
