such factors include those described below and in risk factors 
although we have sought to identify the most significant risks to our business  we cannot predict whether  or to what extent  any of such risks may be realized 
we also cannot assure that we have identified all possible issues which we might face 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements that we make  except as required by law 
overview we were organized as a massachusetts corporation in and reincorporated under the laws of delaware in since our founding  we have established a year track record of innovation in rf  microwave and millimeterwave semiconductor technology 
from to  our principal activity was government sponsored research and development relating to advanced  application specific radio frequency integrated circuits  or rfics  and monolithic microwave integrated circuits  or mmics  primarily for military and other government related programs 
during this period  we developed many innovative technologies that we continue to incorporate in our products today 
in  we began to transition our focus from government sponsored research and development activities to the design  development and production of our own ics  modules  subsystems and instrumentation 
our early products were custom mmics designed for use in specific defense programs  such as radar applications 
in  we published our first catalog  which contained standard products  and began to expand our operations to support our growing commercial business 
we also established a dedicated direct technical sales force to promote our emerging standard product line 
in  we opened our first international sales office  and began to focus on expanding our international business 
we currently have sales and technical support staff in canada  china  egypt  finland  germany  india  ireland  japan  korea  norway  sweden  taiwan  turkey and the united kingdom  to complement our united states offices 
in  we derived of our revenue from customers outside the united states 
in  we completed our initial public offering of common stock 
we also established our first remote design center in istanbul  turkey and acquired substantially all the assets and employees of q dot  inc  a research and development organization based in colorado springs  colorado 
in  we opened a design center in ottawa  ontario  canada 
in october  we entered into a strategic agreement with northrop grumman space technology sector to market a specified list of existing velocium products worldwide  to license related technology and to assume the associated customer relationships  at a cost of million 
in june  we entered into an agreement to license certain millimeterwave technology from ibm at a cost of million 
in january  we acquired arctic silicon devices  a developer of advanced mixed signal ic technology  located in trondheim  norway  for approximately million in cash 
in september  we opened design centers in cairo  egypt and roanoke  virginia 
in  we established our international operations center in cork  ireland 
as of december   we offer more than  standard products in our catalog and many more custom products  which may be categorized for descriptive purposes into functional product lines 

table of contents we employ a fabless business strategy  which means that we do not own a semiconductor fabrication facility  or fab  and purchase all of our semiconductor wafer requirements from third party wafer fabrication facilities  known as foundries 
we believe that our fabless business model enables us to access a broad range of technologies and quickly respond to new market opportunities  while significantly reducing our capital requirements 
management summary our revenue was essentially flat in  increasing to million compared to million in our gross profit was of revenue in compared to of revenue in operating income declined to million in compared to million in  primarily due to increased research and development expenses 
our net income per diluted share was for compared to a net income per diluted share of for we generated positive cash flow from operations of million for compared to million for  primarily due to decreased profitability as a result of increased operating expenses 
description of our revenue  costs and expenses revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of standard and custom products 
we develop standard products from our own specifications  which we sell through our direct sales organization  our network of independent sales representatives  two distributors and our website 
we also develop custom products to meet the specialized requirements of individual customers  which are sold by our direct sales organization 
we sell our products to oems that supply advanced electronic systems to commercial and military end users  and to these oems contract manufacturers 
in general  the decision to purchase our product is made by the oem  which has designed our product into its system 
in the event that we sell to an oem contract manufacturer  the contract manufacturer typically does not have discretion to replace our product with one from a different supplier 
our sales cycle varies substantially  ranging from a period of a month or less when a customer selects a standard product from our selection guide or website  to as long as two years or more for custom products 
in the sales process  our sales and application engineers work closely with the oem customer to analyze the customer system requirements and select an appropriate standard product or establish a technical specification for a custom product 
in the case of a custom product  we also select a semiconductor process and foundry  and evaluate test wafers and finished components before manufacturing in commercial quantities can begin 
volume purchases of our products by an oem customer  or its contract manufacturer  generally do not occur until the oem customer has made the decision to begin production of the system incorporating our product 
our receipt of substantial revenue from sales of a product to an oem customer depends on that customer commercial success in manufacturing and selling its system incorporating our product 
it may take several years for a newly introduced standard product to generate substantial revenue  if ever 
however  the life cycles of our standard products tend to be lengthy 
although most of our revenue is derived from sales of our products  we also receive a small percentage of our revenue from customer sponsored research and development activities 
these activities range from pure research  in which we investigate ic design techniques on new semiconductor technologies at the request of a government agency or commercial customer  to custom development 
table of contents projects in which we are paid to enhance or modify an existing product or develop a new product to meet a customer specifications 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers that we purchase from our third party foundries and other materials such as packages  epoxies  connectors and production masks 
cost of revenue also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering operations  including occupancy and equipment costs  shipping costs  charges for inventory excess and obsolescence and warranty obligations and amortization of related intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our research and development organization  third party consulting costs  costs of development wafers  license fees for computer aided design software  costs of development testing and evaluation  costs of developing automated test software  related occupancy and equipment costs and amortization of related intangible assets 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing organization  sales commissions paid to independent sales representatives  costs of advertising  trade shows  corporate marketing  promotion  travel  related occupancy and equipment costs  amortization of related intangible assets and other marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our executive management  finance  and other administrative staff  outside professional fees including legal and accounting  related occupancy and equipment costs and other corporate expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  fixed assets  intangible assets  stock based compensation  income taxes  accrued expenses and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
the accounting policies described below are those which  in our opinion  involve the most significant application of judgment  or involve complex estimation  and which could  if different judgments or estimates were made  materially affect our reported results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for the majority of our business when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
effective january  we adopted new guidance for arrangements that involve multiple elements  which is applicable to arrangements originating or materially modified after such date 
this guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue allocation  and requires that we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
for multiple element arrangements not subject to the new guidance we allocate arrangement consideration among the 
table of contents elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
if the fair value of an undelivered element cannot be established  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting and revenue is recognized when all performance obligations are met 
we maintain a reserve for potential sales returns and allowances 
returns and customer credits  which historically have been immaterial  are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
rights of return are generally not included in sales arrangements 
however  a portion of our sales are made to two distributors under agreements that provide for product return privileges 
as a result  we defer recognition of revenue from sales to these distributors until the product is resold by the distributors 
revenue from contracts with the united states government  government prime contractors and some commercial customers  under which we may design  develop  manufacture  or modify complex aerospace or electronic equipment or provide related services  is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables 
contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule 
contract costs include material  subcontract costs  labor and an allocation of indirect costs 
the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract 
changes in contract performance and estimated gross margin  including the impact of final contract settlements  are recognized in the period in which the changes are determined 
estimated losses on a contract are recognized in full in the period when they become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the inventory and compare product costs with current market value  and write down any inventory with costs in excess of current market value to its net realizable value 
estimating demand is inherently difficult  particularly given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  which can result in excess or obsolete inventory 
this difficulty has increased as we transition from one of our principal foundries 
this transition has resulted in increased purchases of raw materials in order to ensure adequate supplies of affected products 
because these products have long lives  our estimates of future demand must cover longer than usual periods  which increases the risk that if actual demand is less than forecast  we may need to write off some or all of these advance purchases as excess or obsolete 
at december  and  our raw material inventory includes million and million  respectively  of advance purchases of wafers from this foundry 
we recorded expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively  to reduce inventory to its net realizable value 
once we have written down inventory to its estimated net realizable value  we establish a new cost basis for that inventory and do not increase its carrying value due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
accordingly  if inventory previously written down is subsequently sold  we may realize improved gross profit margins on these transactions 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
in september  the fasb issued new guidance which provides an entity the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two step goodwill impairment test 
if this is 
table of contents the case  the two step goodwill impairment test is required 
if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting is greater than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
we adopted this guidance as of the fourth quarter of if the two step goodwill impairment test is required  first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  we perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit fair value to determine the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance 
indicators of potential impairment include a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the business or industry in which the asset is used or sold  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset  and significant advances in our technologies that require changes in one or more of our manufacturing processes 
if we believe that an indicator of potential impairment exists  we test to determine whether the impairment recognition criteria have been met 
to analyze a potential impairment  we project undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset or the primary asset in the asset group  using a probability weighted multiple scenario approach  reflecting a range of possible outcomes 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset or asset group less any costs of disposition 
evaluating the impairment requires judgment by our management to estimate future operating results and cash flows 
if different estimates were used  the amount and timing of asset impairments could be affected 
we charge impairments of the long lived assets to operations if our evaluations indicate that the carrying values of these assets are not fully recoverable 
stock based compensation 
we measure compensation cost related to stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant  and recognize this cost as expense over the service period the awards are expected to vest  net of estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we did not grant any stock options in  or estimating the amount of share based payments that will ultimately either vest or be forfeited requires judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including the type of the award  vesting terms  employee group  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
income taxes 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  
table of contents differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related assets or liabilities are settled or the reported amount of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we recognize in our financial statements the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return only if it is more likely than not that such benefit would be sustained on its technical merits in the event of a tax audit 
the assessment of each tax position requires significant judgment 
all tax positions are periodically analyzed and adjusted as a result of events  such as the resolution of tax audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in charges or credits to the provision for income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further disclosure regarding income taxes 
factors and trends that affect our results of operations in reading our financial statements  you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance 
revenue 
we operate in a cyclical industry  and growth in our revenue is highly dependent on conditions in the global economy 
from to  our revenue grew from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
in  our revenue decreased to million  due to the global economic downturn and related credit crisis that affected us along with the entire semiconductor industry 
in  our revenue increased to million and in increased to million 
in  our revenue was essentially flat  growing to million 
there is no certainty that our business will continue to grow 
generally  our revenue growth results from growing market acceptance of standard products we introduced in prior periods  increased sales of our standard products  derived from the introduction of new products  which expands the breadth and diversity of our standard product offerings  and the expansion of our domestic and international sales efforts 
in establishing current and future planned levels of operating expenses  we seek to balance near term financial goals with our longer term strategic objectives 
accordingly  we took steps early in to reduce expenses across our business  and maintained certain of these measures throughout the year 
during  and  we increased spending to support our growth 
going forward  we expect to increase spending in research and development in order to remain competitive  and our plans for growth also require increased spending to support our operations  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
gross margin 
one of our objectives is to maximize our gross margin  which is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of our revenue 
our gross margins were in  in and in in general  we seek to introduce high performance products that are valued by our customers for their ability to address technically challenging applications  rather than commodity ics for use in high volume applications where cost  rather than performance  is the highest priority 
we also seek continuously to reduce our costs and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
our gross margin in any period is significantly affected by industry demand and the intensity of competition in the markets into which we sell our products and by pricing  including fluctuations in the relative proportion of high volume orders  on which we offer higher discounts 
gross margins are also 
table of contents significantly affected by product mix  that is  the percentage of our revenue in that period that is attributable to higher or lower margin products 
additional factors affecting our gross margins include changes in the cost of wafers and materials  the timing of indirect costs for pre production masks and evaluation materials  changes in estimates for contracts recognized on a percentage of completion basis  variations in overhead absorption  charges for excess or obsolescent inventory  and other manufacturing efficiencies  and numerous other factors  some of which are not under our control 
our margins can be substantially affected by changes in our manufacturing yields 
our yields depend on many factors that we control  such as product design and the effectiveness of our own assembly and test operations  but they are also affected by the activities of third parties  such as the foundries and packaging subcontractors that supply us with critical materials and services  that are beyond our control 
as a result of these or other factors  we may be unable to maintain or increase our gross margin in future periods 
purchasing patterns of our standard products 
a majority of our revenue in each quarter is typically derived from sales of our standard products 
purchasers of our standard products generally do not enter into long term contracts with us 
customers that purchase large volumes of our standard products generally provide us with periodic forecasts of their requirements for those products  but these forecasts do not commit the customer to minimum purchases  and customers generally may revise these forecasts without penalty 
a significant portion of our revenue in each quarter is attributable to purchase orders for standard products that are received and fulfilled in that quarter  often including a large number of orders from diverse customers and markets 
our customers requested lead times in general have become shorter 
the price list for our standard products includes discounts based on purchase order volume  and  as a result  the revenue we receive from sales of a particular product in any period is influenced by the average order size for that product during that period 
our forecasting of sales of standard products takes into account a number of factors  including historical sales patterns for each individual product  our assessment of overall market conditions and our knowledge of the current requirements and purchasing practices of our larger customers 
however  the absence  in most cases  of long term purchase commitments for our standard products complicates the task of predicting the exact sources and amount of our revenue from standard products and thus  to some extent  the amount of our total revenue in any quarter 
the difficulty of this task is compounded by the uncertainties we and our customers face  related to the recent global economic conditions 
relationships with major customers 
we have historically depended on a small number of customers for a large percentage of our annual revenue 
revenue derived from our largest customers as a percentage of our annual revenue was in  in and in one customer  boeing  accounted for of our revenue in  in and in we include in these calculations revenue from products sold to these customers directly by us or through sales representatives and our distributors  as well as from products sold to contract manufacturers for use in a system manufactured by the contract manufacturer for that customer 
our major customers often use our products in multiple systems or programs  sometimes developed by different business units within the customer organization  each having differing product life cycles  end customers and market dynamics 
while the composition of our top customers varies from year to year  we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
need for continued product and technology innovation 
we believe that the breadth of our product line with respect to functionality  performance and frequency coverage  and our ability to introduce new products rapidly  afford us a significant competitive advantage and have contributed significantly to our revenue growth 
our product development strategy emphasizes internally funded research and development  as well as the acquisition of products and technologies through business combinations and licensing arrangements 
as a result of these efforts  we introduced new standard catalog products in  in and in additionally  we introduced new product lines in  in 
table of contents and in our future competitive position will depend in large part on our ability to continue to innovate  to anticipate the rapid changes in semiconductor technology and rf  microwave and millimeterwave circuit design techniques that characterize our industry and to develop  introduce and successfully market new products that meet the evolving application requirements of our customers 
as the complexity and degree of integration of our products increases  maintaining or increasing our historical rate of new product introductions has become increasingly challenging 
driving and supporting this process of continuous innovation and new product introduction is one of our key priorities  and one that will require continuing expenditures 
need to meet customer demand for on time delivery and high quality 
the success of our business also depends on our continued ability to supply our products on time and in quantities adequate to meet our customers requirements  while maintaining the high standards of quality and reliability that our customers require 
our senior management spends a significant amount of its time on these key operational issues  and we devote substantial resources to maintain our sources of supply and to improve our manufacturing and quality control processes 
need to continue to expand the diversity of our product lines  customer base  markets and target applications 
the semiconductor industry in general  and specific segments of the markets that we serve  are highly cyclical and have historically experienced significant fluctuations in demand  including periods of rapid growth as well as periods of product overcapacity and weak demand  which occur even during periods of growth in the broader economy 
specific segments of the markets we serve may respond in different ways to conditions in the broader economy  for a variety of reasons 
in  our three largest markets were military  microwave and millimeterwave communications and test and measurement  which accounted for of our annual revenue in in and  our three largest markets were military  microwave and millimeterwave communications and cellular infrastructure  which accounted for and of our annual revenue in and  respectively 
an important objective of our management is to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in demand from any particular customer or industry segment by continuing to broaden our customer base and markets and the range of applications that our products address

our revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenue in  compared with in our revenue increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in sales to the test and measurement market and a million increase in sales to the space market  which were partially offset by a million decrease in sales to the cellular market  a million decrease in sales to the military market  a million decrease in sales to the microwave and millimeterwave communications market and a million decrease in sales to the broadband market 
we believe that the growth in sales to the test and measurement and space markets reflects increased market share due to the broader range of our product offerings and increased market acceptance of products we introduced in prior years 
the decrease in sales to the microwave and millimeterwave communications and cellular markets reflects weaker demand for our products used in infrastructure projects by our telecommunications customers 
the decrease in sales to the military market primarily relates to our completion of a systems contract in  as well as lower pricing on certain military programs  which were only partially offset by increased volume 
gross margin 
our gross margin was in  compared with in the increase in our aggregate gross margin across all products was attributable to a net basis point improvement due to product mix and a net basis point improvement due to lower manufacturing costs  partially offset by a net basis point decrease due to pricing

provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased million to million in  from million in  representing an effective tax rate of and in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate increased primarily due to a tax benefit recognized in related to the resolution of the us internal revenue service examination of our fiscal through income tax returns and the related decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
additionally  in the second quarter of  we completed the initial phase of a global expansion project 
the objective of this project is to better service our international customers and better manage our global suppliers 
the initial impact of implementing this project was to increase our effective tax rate  resulting in a net increase in in the longer term  we expect our effective tax rate to decrease

we maintain a stock repurchase program that is intended to offset the dilutive impact of equity based compensation granted to our employees 
shares may be repurchased from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
we did not repurchase any shares during the timing  price and volume of any additional repurchases will be based on market conditions  relevant securities law and other factors  as appropriate  and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and introduction of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
there is no assurance that additional financing  if required or desired  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
backlog we typically do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and our revenue in any period is dependent to a significant extent on orders for standard products booked and shipped in that period 
our customers requested delivery lead times in general have become shorter 
additionally  despite the existence of contractual penalties  our customers from time to time cancel or delay scheduled purchases 
as a result  we use backlog as a key element of scheduling production but do not consider it to be an accurate indicator of sales for any future period 
generally  we include in our backlog all accepted purchase orders for which the customer has specified a delivery date within the next months  as well as long term production contracts that require longer than months to perform and for which funding is committed 
at december   our backlog was million  compared to million at december  
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
we adopted asu effective january  such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires an entity to disclose amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity will be required to present  either on the face of financial statements or in a single note  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line item affected by the reclassification

contractual obligations at december   our known contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases as of december   the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was million 
although it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns could materially change in the next months  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement of these unrecognized tax benefits  if any  will occur with a tax authority  as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolution of those examinations is uncertain
