item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in asc topic  segment reporting 
our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
medicare and medicaid are consuming a greater percentage of federal and states budgets  respectively  which is exacerbated in times of economic downturn 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicare and medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and is a part of the solution to both balancing the federal budget and the states medicaid financing problems 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan will place primary emphasis on the development of our home health operations 
as our business grows we may evaluate opportunities for the provision of other health care services in patients homes that would be consistent with our senior advocacy mission 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  expand the significance of our home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers  through the startup of new agencies and potentially by providing new services in patients homes consistent with our senior advocacy mission  and expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 

table of contents health care reform legislation and medicare regulations the us congress has been pursuing a comprehensive reform of the us healthcare system since early numerous changes have been enacted  proposed and continue to be debated  which are discussed in more detail in part i  item  government regulation and part i  item a  risk factors 
many of the change provisions do not take effect for an extended period of time and most will require the publication of implementing regulations and or the issuance of programmatic guidelines 
it is reasonable to expect that the implementation of the aca and other changes and potential changes described in part i  item  government regulation  might have a more immediate and negative impact on those providers generating lower margins than us  with more leverage relative to earnings than us  with less capital resources than us  or with less ability to adapt their operations 
we believe this may result in a contraction of the number of home health providers 
in the event of such a contraction in the number of providers  we believe the surviving providers may benefit from a higher rate of admissions growth than would have otherwise occurred 
those surviving providers may earn incremental margins on those higher admissions that may serve to offset a portion of the rate reduction from the medicare program 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting such higher admissions 
it is also reasonable to expect that future rate cuts will present additional opportunities for us to make acquisitions of other providers at valuations and on terms that are attractive to us and enable us to spread our segment and unallocated corporate overhead expenses across a larger business base 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making such acquisitions or that such opportunities will present themselves 
as a result of the broad scope of health care reform  the significant changes it will effect in the healthcare industry and society generally  and the complexity of the technical issues it addresses  we are unable to predict  at this time  all the ramifications health care reform may have on our business as a health care provider or a sponsor of an employee health insurance benefit plan 
these matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition in ways not currently anticipated by us 
this may increase our costs  decrease our revenues  expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business 
refer to the results of operations for the impact of these items on revenue  operating and net income for the years ended december  and management is continuing its work to evaluate the implications of these changes and to develop appropriate courses of action for the company 
additionally  we may be unable to take actions to mitigate any or all of the negative implications of these matters 
we may contemplate formulating and taking actions intended to mitigate or otherwise offset some of the negative effects of reimbursement changes 
these actions may include any or all of the following attempting to increase our revenues by investing more resources in sales and marketing activities  development of diagnosis related specialty programs and increasing our educational programs regarding the value of home health to drive admission growth  establishing startup branch operations to expand our service territories  and acquisitions of underperforming providers with strong referral relationships  attempting to reduce our costs by developing a more efficient delivery model  increasing the productivity standards for our staff  optimizing the appropriate use of different levels of professional staff  limiting or eliminating the growth in wage rates  limiting or reducing the size of our work force  closing unprofitable branch operations and accelerating our efforts to evaluate the use of various technological approaches to the delivery of patient care to improve patient outcomes and or improve the productivity of our workforce  evaluating the potential implications of health care reform on our employee benefit plans  and possible changes we may need to make to our plans  and potentially other actions we deem appropriate including evaluation of potential additional service offerings in patients homes consistent with our senior advocacy mission or changing the mix of the types of services we provide 
although we will attempt to mitigate or otherwise offset the negative effect of health care reform on our reimbursement revenue and our employee benefit plans  our actions may not ultimately be cost effective or prove successful
