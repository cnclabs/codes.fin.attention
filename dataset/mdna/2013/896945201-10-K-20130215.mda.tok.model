in addition to the flagship tripadvisor brand  we now manage and operate other travel brands  connected by the common goal of providing comprehensive travel planning resources across the travel sector 
executive summary our financial results are currently principally dependent on our ability to drive our click based advertising revenue 
we continue to invest in areas of potential click based revenue growth  including our social  mobile and global initiatives  while also focusing on growing both our subscription based products  such as vacation rentals and business listings  and our transaction based businesses  which include sniqueaway and tingo 
we have leveraged our position as the largest online travel company to become an important partner for online advertisers including hotels  online travel agencies and other travel related service providers by providing our customers with access to our large audience of highly qualified  highly engaged users 
the key drivers of our click based advertising revenue are described below  as well as a summary of our key growth areas and the current trends impacting our business 
key drivers of click based advertising revenue for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our total revenue came from our core cost per click  or cpc  based lead generation product 
the key drivers of our click based advertising revenue include the growth in hotel shoppers  user conversion and lead pricing 
total traffic growth  or growth in monthly visits from unique ip addresses is reflective of our overall brand growth 
we track and analyze sub segments of traffic and its correlation to revenue generation and utilize hotel shoppers as an indicator of revenue growth 
we use the term hotel shoppers to refer to users who view a listing of hotels in a city or visitors who view a specific hotel page 
after hotel shoppers  the second driver of our business is user conversion  which is a measure of how many hotel shoppers ultimately click on a cpc link that generates revenue for us 
user conversion on our site is primarily driven by three factors merchandising  commerce coverage and choice 
we think of merchandising as the number and location of ads that are available on a page  commerce coverage is whether we have a client who can take an online booking for a particular property  and choice is the number of clients available for any given property  allowing the user to shop for the best price 
in summary  our cpc revenue depends on the number of hotel shoppers that are interested in a property  whether there is a commerce link available for that hotel shopper to click on for that property and whether there are several commerce choices available for that property  so the hotel shopper can shop around 
the other key driver that we look at is the cpc price that online travel agencies and hoteliers are willing to pay us for our leads 
key growth areas we continue to invest in areas of potential growth  including our social  mobile and global initiatives as well as our subscription based products  such as vacation rentals and business listings 

table of contents social 
our wisdom of friends initiative is a core component of our strategic growth plan  of respondents to a recent nielsen study cited recommendations from people i know as the information source that they trust most 
we believe that having a strong social presence drives traffic to and engagement on our sites and improves the sites stickiness amongst the users 
as a result  we continue to deepen our integration with facebook 
as of december   and according to appdata  an independent application tracking traffic service  tripadvisor has averaged more than million monthly facebook users via it s tripadvisor facebook application id 
we offer these facebook users a personalized and social travel planning experience that enables travelers to engage first with their own facebook friends reviews and opinions when planning their perfect trip on tripadvisor 
mobile 
mobile is an investment area that is geared towards creating a more complete user experience by reinforcing the tripadvisor brand when users are in market 
in the year ended december   we saw strong mobile user uptake  as aggregate downloads of our tripadvisor  city guides  and seatguru apps more than doubled to million and during the fourth quarter of we averaged more than million monthly unique users on mobile devices  as measured by our own log files 
we believe that travelers will increasingly use mobile devices  including smartphones and tablets  to conduct travel research and planning 
vacation rentals 
our vacation rentals product addresses a highly fragmented billion per year vacation rental industry  according to a radius global market study 
historically  we have built our supply content through acquisitions  namely our us based flipkey and uk based holidaylettings businesses  but during the fourth quarter of we announced partnerships aimed at increasing our supply content 
we had more than  properties as of december   up more than during the year  and we believe our highly engaged and motivated community create a competitive advantage for us in this market 
business listings 
created in early  our business listings product enables hotel and accommodation owners to list pertinent property information on tripadvisor  bringing them closer to potential customers and thereby increasing direct bookings 
in the year ended december   we grew our business listings customer base over to  subscribers  still representing just over of our current hotel and accommodation listings on tripadvisor branded sites 
we continue to expand our sales force and improve features to grow our subscriber base 
current trends affecting our business increasing competition 
the travel review industry and  more generally  the business of collecting and aggregating travel related resources and information  continue to be increasingly competitive 
in recent years  an increasing number of companies  such as search companies google inc and baidu 
com  inc and several large online travel agencies  have begun to collect and aggregate travel information and resources 
we plan to continue to invest in order to remain the leading source of travel reviews as well as continuing to enhance our content and user experience 
increasing use of internet and social media to access travel information 
commerce  information and advertising continue to migrate to the internet and away from traditional media outlets 
we believe that this trend will create strategic growth opportunities  allowing us to attract new consumers and develop unique and effective advertising solutions 
consumers are increasingly using online social media  such as facebook  as a means to communicate and exchange information  including travel information and opinions 
we have made significant efforts related to social networking in order to leverage the expanding use of this channel and enhance traffic diversification and user engagement 
we are also continually adapting our user experience in response to a changing internet environment and usage trends 
for example  in we invested in building a hotel metasearch product for our smartphone platforms and we currently plan to roll out our hotel metasearch product on our desktop and tablet platforms during the next three to six months 
we expect to continue to develop our metasearch capabilities  because we believe that by showing users real time pricing and availability wherever possible across our global points of sale  we can provide a better user experience while delivering highly qualified leads to our advertising partners 

table of contents increasing mobile usage 
consumers are increasingly using smartphone and tablet computing devices to access the internet 
to address these demands  we continue to extend the platform to develop smartphone and tablet applications to allow greater access to our travel information and resources 
although the substantial majority of our smartphone users also access and engage with our websites on personal computers and tablets where we display advertising  our users could decide to increasingly access our products primarily through smartphone devices 
historically we have not displayed graphic advertising on smartphones and our smartphone monetization strategies are still developing 
improvement of our mobile offerings is a key company priority which we believe is necessary to help us maintain and grow our user base and engagement over the long term and we will continue to invest and innovate in this growing platform 
click based advertising revenue 
in recent years  the majority of our revenue growth resulted from higher click based advertising revenue due to increased traffic on our websites and an increase in the volume of clicks on our advertisers placements 
although click based advertising revenue growth has generally been driven by traffic volume  we remain focused on the various factors that could impact revenue growth  including  but not limited to  the growth in hotel shoppers  cpc pricing fluctuations  the overall economy  the ability of advertisers to monetize our traffic  the quality and mix of traffic to our websites  and the quality and mix of traffic from our advertising placements to advertisers  as well as advertisers evolving approach to transaction attribution models and return on investment targets 
we monitor and regularly respond to changes in these factors in order to strategically improve our user experience  customer satisfaction and monetization in this dynamic environment 
global economic conditions 
in late and throughout  weak global economic conditions created uncertainty for travelers and suppliers  and put pressure on discretionary spending on travel and advertising 
since the travel industry has been gradually improving 
however  global economic conditions remain uncertain  and in particular  we anticipate travel expenditures in europe to continue to be adversely effected by the economic issues overseas 
spin off on april   expedia announced its plan to separate into two independent public companies in order to better achieve certain strategic objectives of its various businesses 
we refer to this transaction as the spin off 
non recurring expenses incurred to affect the spin off during the year ended december  have been included within spin off costs in the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
on december   following the close of trading on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq  the spin off was completed  and tripadvisor began trading as an independent public company on december  expedia effected the spin off by means of a reclassification of its capital stock that resulted in the holders of expedia capital stock immediately prior to the time of effectiveness of the reclassification having the right to receive a proportionate amount of tripadvisor capital stock 
a one for two reverse stock split of outstanding expedia capital stock occurred immediately prior to the spin off  with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares 
in connection with the spin off  expedia contributed or transferred all of the subsidiaries and assets relating to expedia s tripadvisor media group  which were comprised of the tripadvisor holdings  llc combined financial statements  to tripadvisor and tripadvisor or one of its subsidiaries assumed all of the liabilities relating to expedia s tripadvisor media group 
tripadvisor now trades on the nasdaq under the symbol trip 
in connection with the spin off  on december   tripadvisor holdings  llc distributed approximately million in cash to expedia in the form of a dividend 
this distribution was funded through borrowings under a credit agreement  dated as of december   by and among tripadvisor  tripadvisor holdings  llc  and tripadvisor llc  the lenders party thereto  jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and jp morgan europe limited  as london agent this credit agreement  together with all exhibits

table of contents adjusted ebitda to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results  we have disclosed adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  within this annual report on form k 
we have provided reconciliations below of adjusted ebitda to operating income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
a non gaap financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance  financial position  or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in such company s financial statements 
we define adjusted ebitda as operating income  excluding depreciation of property and equipment  which includes internal use software and website development  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation and non recurring expenses incurred to effect the spin off from expedia during the year ended december  adjusted ebitda is the primary metric by which management evaluates the performance of its business and on which internal budgets are based 
in particular  the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period to period basis 
adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations such as the costs incurred in connection with the spin off or those costs that do not require a cash outlay  such as stock based compensation 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense  which are based on our estimates of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets 
these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset  are based on historical costs and other factors and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures 
we believe that by excluding certain items  such as stock based compensation and non recurring expenses  adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business  from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock based compensation  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements  and other companies  including companies in our own industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures  including various cash flow metrics  net income and our other gaap results

our primary operating metric prior to the spin off for evaluating operating performance was operating income before amortization  or oiba  as reported on our form s  filed with the sec on november  oiba is defined as operating income plus amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment  stock based compensation expense  and non recurring expenses incurred to effect the spin off during the year ended december  this operating metric is no longer being used by our management to measure operating performance and is only being shown above to illustrate the financial impact as we converted to a new operating metric post spin off and is also currently used to calculate our annual obligation for our charitable foundation

reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period s data to the current format  which include the reclassifications of our redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets from accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the reclassification of accrued marketing costs from accounts payable to accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
these reclassifications had no net effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements 
revenue we derive substantially all of our revenue through the sale of advertising  primarily through click based advertising and  to a lesser extent  display based advertising 
in addition  we earn revenue through a combination of subscription based offerings related to our business listings and vacation rentals products  transaction revenue from selling room nights on our transactional sites sniqueaway and tingo  and other revenue including content licensing 
the following discussion of revenue includes references to the number of unique internet protocol  or ip  addresses that visit tripadvisor branded sites each month 
this metric is one of the metrics used by us to analyze revenue and is measured using internally developed analytical tools 
each unique ip address is only counted the first time it visits a tripadvisor site during each calendar month 
our measurement of unique visitors does not include any visitors to our subsidiary sites that are not tripadvisor branded  nor does it include any individuals who view tripadvisor content on other sites 
while directionally indicative  unique ip address tracking has recently become less valuable as a revenue growth metric because of the continually increasing diversification of our site traffic and usage  particularly in light of our users engagement with non hotel based site content  such as 
table of contents restaurants and attractions 
as such  we believe that using hotel shoppers as a metric is a more useful indicator of future revenue growth and began to track this metric using internally developed analytical tools in year ended december  change vs

we are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee  on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility for each fiscal quarter and fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit 
the term loan and loans under the revolving credit facility currently bear interest at libor plus basis points  or the eurocurrency spread  or the alternate base rate abr plus basis points  and undrawn amounts are currently subject to a commitment fee of basis points 
as of december  we are using a one month interest period eurocurrency spread which is approximately per annum 
interest is currently payable on a monthly basis while we are borrowing under the one month interest rate period 
the current interest rates are based on current assumptions  leverage and libor rates and do not take into account that rates will reset periodically

the decrease in working capital movements in vs 
was primarily driven by the classification of related party activity with expedia of million which was classified in operating activities in  as compared to investing activities in the periods prior to the spin off  offset by the timing of customer cash receipts and the timing of tax and vendor payments

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements because they require that management use judgment and estimates in applying those policies 
we prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with gaap 
preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time management was making the estimate  and or changes in the estimate or different estimates that management could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
for more information on each of these policies  see note significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
a discussion of information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates is below 

table of contents recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definite lived intangible assets goodwill 
we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we assess goodwill  which is not amortized  for impairment annually as of october  or more frequently  if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
we have one reportable segment 
the segment is determined based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business  makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance 
in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount 
if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount  no further testing is necessary 
if  however  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount  we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis 
in step two of the analysis  we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 
indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually on october  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
similar to the qualitative assessment for goodwill  we may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  no further testing is necessary 
if  however  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  we compare the fair value of the indefinite lived asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of an individual indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the individual asset is written down by an amount equal to such excess 
the assessment of qualitative factors is optional and at our discretion 
we may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
as part of our qualitative assessment for our impairment analysis  the factors that we considered for our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets included  but were not limited to a changes in macroeconomic conditions in the overall economy and the specific markets in which we operate  b our ability to access capital  c changes in the online travel industry  d changes in the level of competition  e comparison of our current financial performance to historical and budgeted results  f changes in excess market capitalization over book value based on our current common stock price and latest consolidated balance sheet  and g comparison of the excess of the fair value of our of trade names and trademarks to the carrying value of those same assets  using the results of our most recent quantitative assessment 
after considering these factors and the impact that changes in such factors would have on the inputs used in our previous quantitative assessment  we determined for our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that it was more likely than not that these assets were not impaired 
therefore no impairment charges were recognized to our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  for our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
since the annual impairment tests in october  there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate any potential impairment and our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not currently considered at risk 
in the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill or our indefinite lived intangibles is impaired  an impairment charge would be recorded 

table of contents definite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets with definite lives and other long lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups  including property and equipment  to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  among others 
if such facts indicate a potential impairment  we assess the recoverability of the asset by determining if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the asset 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows 
any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
we have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment assessment as of december  for additional information on our goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and definite lived intangibles refer to note goodwill and intangible assets  net in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the advertising services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
click based advertising 
revenue is derived primarily from click through fees charged to our travel partners for traveler leads sent to the travel partners website 
we record revenue from click through fees after the traveler makes the click through to the travel partners websites 
display and other advertising 
we recognize display advertising revenue ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions  depending on the terms of the advertising contract 
subscription based revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription period 
we recognize revenue from all other sources either upon delivery or when we provide the service 
deferred revenue  which primarily relates to our subscription based programs  is recorded when payments are received in advance of our performance as required by the underlying agreements 
income taxes we compute and account for our income taxes on a separate tax return basis 
we record income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes 
we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting 
accordingly  we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense 
we consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  as well as assessing available tax planning strategies 
we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our 
table of contents businesses  future changes in income tax law  tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results  we make certain judgments and estimates 
therefore  actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 
we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return 
the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position  taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position  based on technical merits  will be sustained upon examination 
for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained  we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability 
the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 
we have not provided for deferred us income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest permanently outside the united states 
should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to us income taxes 
due to complexities in tax laws and various assumptions that would have to be made  it is not practicable  at this time  to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred us taxes on these earnings 
stock based compensation tripadvisor equity grants assumed at spin off all stock based compensation included in our consolidated and combined financial statements prior to the spin off relates to expedia common stock options and restricted stock units rsus held by tripadvisor employees prior to the spin off 
the following methods were used to measure the fair value of these awards and we will continue to amortize the fair value thereof as follows for all pre spin off equity grants stock options 
the value of stock options issued or modified  including unvested options assumed in acquisitions  on the grant date or modification or acquisition dates  if applicable were measured at fair value  using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility  expected term  dividend yield and risk free interest rates 
the expected volatility was based on historical volatility of expedia s common stock and other relevant factors 
the expected term assumptions were based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees 
we will continue to amortize the fair value  net of estimated forfeitures  over the remaining vesting term on a straight line basis  with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
the majority of these stock options vest over four years 
restricted stock units 
rsus are stock awards granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests  typically over a five year period 
rsus were measured at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of expedia s common stock at the date of grant 
we will continue to amortize the fair value of these awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight line basis  with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
tripadvisor equity grants awards issued subsequent to the spin off we adopted the tripadvisor  inc stock and annual incentive plan  or the incentive plan  as of december   under which we may grant restricted stock  restricted stock awards  rsus  stock options and other stock based awards to our directors  officers  employees and consultants 
refer to note stock based awards and other equity instruments in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further information on the incentive plan 

table of contents stock option activity the exercise price for all stock options granted by us to date has been equal to the market price of the underlying shares of common stock at the date of grant 
in this regard  when making stock option awards  our practice is to determine the applicable grant date and to specify that the exercise price shall be the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock options granted during the year ended december  had a term of ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a four year requisite service period 
during the year ended december   we issued  of primarily service based stock options under the incentive plan with a weighted average grant date fair value per option of 
we will amortize the fair value  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting term of four years on a straight line basis  with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
the estimated fair value of the options granted under the incentive plan to date  have been calculated using a black scholes merton option pricing model black scholes model 
the black scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock based awards  which includes the risk free rate of return  volatility  expected term and expected dividend yield 
our risk free interest rate is based on the rates currently available on zero coupon us treasury issues  in effect at the time of the grant  whose remaining maturity period most closely approximates the stock option s expected term assumption 
we estimated the volatility of our common stock by using an average of historical stock price volatility of publicly traded companies that we consider peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent or approximate to the expected term of the stock option grants 
the decision to use a weighted average volatility factor of a peer group was based upon the relatively short period of availability of data on our common stock 
we estimated our expected term using the simplified method for all stock options as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data on our common stock 
our expected dividend yield is zero  as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date 
restricted stock units rsus are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of our common stock as the award vests 
rsus are measured at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we amortize the fair value  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight line basis  with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
performance based stock options and rsus vest upon achievement of certain company based performance conditions and a requisite service period 
on the date of grant  the fair value of performance based awards is determined based on the fair value  which is calculated using the same method as our service based stock options and rsus described above 
we then assess whether it is probable that the performance targets would be achieved 
if assessed as probable  compensation expense will be recorded for these awards over the estimated performance period on a straight line basis 
at each reporting period  we will reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
the estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved and of the performance period required to achieve the targets requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of those changes will be recorded in the period estimates are revised  or the change in estimate will be applied prospectively depending on whether the change affects the estimate of total compensation cost to be recognized or merely affects the period over which compensation cost 
table of contents is to be recognized 
the ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation expense recognized will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value 
we have considered many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including our historical attrition rates  the employee class and historical experience 
the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and  to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised

recently adopted accounting pronouncements testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment in july  the fasb issued asu  which amends asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the guidance amends the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill by allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the impairment test of comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after september   however  we have decided to early adopt and make it effective for our impairment review 
accordingly  we have adopted the presentation requirements of asu during the fourth quarter of the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted disclosure about offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued asu  which amends asc subtopic  offsetting 
the guidance requires enhanced disclosures with improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either i offset in accordance with current guidance or ii subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement  irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with current guidance 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after january  the guidance is limited to the form and content of disclosures  and we do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have an impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management we are exposed to certain market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures and by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective is to mitigate potential income statement  cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 
interest rates our current exposure to changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and the outstanding principal on our term loan 
our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in 
table of contents us interest rates and libor 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities  as well as the amount of interest we pay on our outstanding debt 
we currently invest our excess cash in cash deposits at major global banks  money market mutual funds and marketable securities 
our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements 
we invest in highly rated securities  and our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the policy requires investments to be investment grade  with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on our investment positions as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in an approximate million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
as of december   we had million of debt under our term loan  which has a variable rate 
the variable interest rate on the term loan is based on current assumptions  leverage and libor rates 
based on our current loan balance through december   a basis point change in our interest rate on the term loan would result in an increase or decrease to interest expense of approximately million per annum 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate risk  however  we are continually evaluating the interest rate market  and if we become increasingly exposed to potentially volatile movements in interest rates  and if these movements are material  this could cause us to adjust our financing strategy 
we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december   or foreign currency exchange rates we conduct business in certain international markets  primarily the european union  the united kingdom  singapore and china 
because we operate in international markets  we have exposure to different economic climates  political arenas  tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates 
some of our foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their respective local currencies other than the us dollar primarily in british pound sterling 
consequently  changes in currency exchange rates may impact the translation of foreign financial statements into us dollars 
as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency  or functional currency  into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against the local currency  the translation of these foreign currency denominated balances will result in increased net assets  revenue  operating expenses  operating income and net income 
similarly  our net assets  revenue  operating expenses  operating income and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against local currency 
the effect of foreign exchange on our business historically has varied from quarter to quarter and may continue to do so  potentially materially 
a hypothetical increase of the foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  or weakening of the us dollar  would generate an unrealized gain of approximately million related to an increase in our net assets held in functional currencies other than the us dollar as of december   which would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents in addition  foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses 
we recognize these transactional gains and losses primarily euro currency transactions in our consolidated and combined statements of operations and have recorded foreign exchange losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  in other  net 
we currently manage our exposure to foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures 
to the extent practicable  we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies  as well as  using derivative financial instruments 
we use foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage certain short term foreign currency risk to try and reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on our cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to hedge only those currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified and that may result in significant impacts to corporate cash or the consolidated income statement 
our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
our current derivative contracts principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the euro versus the us dollar 
we account for our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carry them at fair value 
as of december  we had outstanding forward currency not designated as hedging contracts with a notional value of million 
these contracts are all short term in nature 
the fair value of these derivatives at december  was a net liability of million and was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
for the year end ended december   million of expense was recorded to other  net on our consolidated and combined statement of operations related to outstanding derivative contracts 
a hypothetical change of the foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant  would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding derivatives as of december  we did not enter into any derivative instruments for the year ending december  and refer to note financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail on our derivative instruments 
as we increase our operations in international markets  our exposure to potentially volatile movements in foreign currency exchange rates increases 
the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our foreign currency risk strategies
