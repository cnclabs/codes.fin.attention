item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses important factors impacting our financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiary for the periods indicated 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is intended to supplement  all of the other items presented in this annual report on form k 
palmetto bancshares  inc is a south carolina bank holding company organized in and headquartered in greenville  sc 
the company serves as the bank holding company for the palmetto bank  which began operations in given our year history  we have developed long standing relationships with clients in the communities in which we operate and a recognizable name  which has resulted in a well established branch network and loyal deposit base 
as a result  we have historically had a lower cost of deposits than our peers due to a higher core deposit mix 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity  in all material respects  with accounting principles generally accepted in the us and with general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with such principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period 
while we base estimates on historical experience  current information and other factors deemed to be relevant  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management  in conjunction with the company s independent registered public accounting firm  has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates discussed herein with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we consider accounting policies and estimates to be critical to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows if the accounting policy or estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
of those significant accounting policies  we have determined that accounting for our allowance for loan losses and the related reserve for unfunded commitments  valuation of other loans held for sale  servicing rights  foreclosed real estate  the realization of our net deferred tax asset  defined benefit pension plan and the determination of fair value of financial instruments are deemed critical because of the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying these balances 
accounting for these critical areas requires subjective and complex judgments and could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses to be critical as this policy involves considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management 
the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of probable inherent losses that have been incurred within the existing loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses methodology is based on historical loss experience by loan type  specific homogeneous risk pools and specific loss allocations 
our process for determining the appropriate level of the 
table of contents allowance for loan losses is designed to account for asset deterioration as it occurs 
the provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual loans  potential problem loans  criticized loans and loans charged off or recovered  among other factors 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects our continuing evaluation of specific lending risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political  and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
portions of the allowance for loan losses may be allocated for specific loans 
however  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for any loan that  in our judgment  should be charged off 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
while we utilize our best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications and collateral valuation 
we record allowances for loan losses on specific loans when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
specific allowances for loans considered individually significant and that exhibit probable or observed weaknesses are determined by analyzing  among other things  the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed  guarantor support  collateral deficiencies  the relative risk rating of the loan and economic conditions impacting the client s industry 
the starting point for the general component of the allowance is the historical loss experience of specific types of loans 
we calculate historical loss ratios for pools of similar loans with similar characteristics based on the proportion of actual loan net charge offs to the total population of loans in the pool 
we use a five year look back period when computing historical loss rates 
however  given the increase in loan charge offs beginning in  since then we have also utilized a three year look back period for computing historical loss rates as an additional reference point in determining the allowance for loan losses 
we increase or decrease these historical loss percentages for qualitative environmental factors derived from macroeconomic indicators and other factors 
qualitative factors we considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses included pervasive factors that generally impact clients across the loan portfolio such as unemployment and consumer price index and factors that have specific implications to particular loan portfolios such as residential home sales or commercial development 
factors evaluated may include  without limitation  changes in delinquent  nonaccrual and troubled debt restructured loan trends  trends in risk ratings and net loans charged off  concentrations of credit  competition  legal and regulatory requirements  trends in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  national and local economic and business conditions  collateral valuations  the experience and depth of lending management  lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards and practices  the quality of loan review systems and the degree of oversight by the board of directors  peer comparisons and other external factors 
the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses determined using the historical loss rates and qualitative factors is then combined with the specific allowance on loans individually evaluated for impairment to determine the total allowance for loan losses 
loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review and or bank examiners are charged off 
we review each impaired loan on a loan by loan basis to determine whether the impairment should be recorded as a charge off or a reserve based on our assessment of the status of the borrower and the underlying collateral 
in general  for collateral dependent loans  the impairment is recorded as a charge off unless the fair value of the collateral was based on an internal valuation pending receipt of a third party appraisal or other extenuating circumstances 
consumer loan accounts are generally charged off based on pre defined past due time periods 
in addition to our loan portfolio review process as disclosed elsewhere in this item  various regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses methodology and calculation 
such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on 
table of contents their judgments and information available to them at the time of their examination 
while we use available information to recognize inherent losses on loans  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic and other factors and the impact of such factors on our clients 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  underlying assumptions may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that was not known to management at the time of the issuance of our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  our assumptions may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance for loan losses or that future increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
additionally  no assurance can be given that our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio  in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant factors  will not require significant future additions to the allowance for loan losses thus adversely impacting the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other loans held for sale other loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the excess of the recorded investment in the loan over the fair value less estimated selling costs 
other loans held for sale for which binding sales contracts have been entered into are reported at the contract amount less estimated costs to sell 
other loans held for sale that are collateral dependent are valued based on independent collateral appraisals less estimated selling costs 
if quoted market prices  binding sales contracts or appraised collateral values are not available  we consider discounted cash flow analyses with market assumptions 
there can be no assurances that the loans will be sold or that any bids offered will be at the currently recorded balances 
accordingly  to the extent that we accept bids for these loans  we may receive significantly less than the current net carrying amount of the loans and could  therefore  incur a corresponding incremental loss on any such loan sales 
servicing rights the value of our residential mortgage and sba servicing rights is an accounting estimate that depends heavily on current economic conditions  specifically the interest rate environment and management s judgments about servicing costs  loan loss experience and prepayment rates 
as of december   our sba servicing rights asset is not material 
for residential mortgage servicing rights  we utilize the expertise of a third party consultant on a quarterly basis to determine  among other things  capitalization  impairment and amortization rates 
estimates of the amount and timing of prepayment rates  loan loss experience  costs to service loans and discount rates are evaluated by the third party consultant  reviewed and approved by us and used to estimate the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
amortization of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio is based on the ratio of net mortgage servicing income received in the current period to total net mortgage servicing income projected to be realized from the mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
projected net mortgage servicing income is determined based on the estimated future balance of the underlying loan portfolio  which declines over time from prepayments and scheduled loan amortization 
future prepayment rates are estimated based on current interest rate levels  other economic conditions  market forecasts and relevant characteristics of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio such as loan types  interest rate stratification and recent prepayment experience 
we believe that the modeling techniques and assumptions used are reasonable 
however  such assumptions may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that mortgage servicing rights portfolio capitalization  amortization and impairment in future periods will not exceed the current capitalization  amortization and impairment amounts 
moreover  no assurance can be given that changing economic conditions and other relevant factors impacting our 
table of contents mortgage servicing rights portfolio will not cause actual results to differ from underlying assumptions thus adversely impacting our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
foreclosed real estate the value of our foreclosed real estate portfolio represents an accounting estimate that depends heavily on current economic conditions 
foreclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs thereby establishing a new cost basis 
fair value of foreclosed real estate is subsequently reviewed regularly and writedowns are recorded when it is determined that the carrying value of the real estate exceeds the fair value less estimated selling costs 
writedowns resulting from the periodic re evaluation of  costs related to holding and gains and losses on the sale of foreclosed properties are charged against income 
costs relating to the development and improvement of foreclosed properties are capitalized 
the fair value of properties in the foreclosed real estate portfolio is generally determined from independent appraisals 
we review the appraisal assumptions for reasonableness and may make adjustments necessary to reflect current market conditions 
such assumptions may not prove to be valid 
moreover  no assurance can be given that changing economic conditions and other relevant factors impacting our foreclosed real estate portfolio will not cause actual occurrences to differ from underlying assumptions thus adversely impacting our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
realization of net deferred tax asset we use certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable and deferred income tax assets and liabilities for events recognized differently in our financial statements and income tax returns and income tax expense or benefit 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
we exercise considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax assets and liabilities 
these judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a periodic basis as regulatory and business factors change 
we include the current and deferred tax impact of our tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than that such positions will be sustained by taxing authorities  with full knowledge of relevant information  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
while we support our tax positions by unambiguous tax law  prior experience with the taxing authorities and analysis that considers all relevant facts  circumstances and regulations  we rely on assumptions and estimates to determine the overall likelihood of success and proper quantification of a given tax position 
as of december   net deferred tax assets  without regard to any valuation allowance  of million were recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheets  a portion of which includes the after tax impact of recent net operating losses 
this net deferred tax asset is fully offset by a valuation allowance as a result of uncertainty surrounding the ultimate realization of these tax benefits 
the need for a valuation allowance is based on the company s cumulative tax losses over the previous two years  net operating loss carryforward limitations as discussed below  projection of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
the private placement was considered a change in control under the internal revenue code and regulations 
accordingly  the company was required to evaluate potential limitation or deferral of our ability to carryforward pre acquisition net operating losses and to determine the amount of net unrealized pre acquisition built in losses  which may be subject to similar limitation or deferral 
under the internal revenue code and regulations  net unrealized pre acquisition built in losses realized within five years of the change in control are subject to potential limitation  which for the company is october  through that date  the company will continue to analyze its ability to utilize such losses to offset anticipated future taxable income as pre acquisition built in losses are ultimately realized 
as of december   the company currently estimates that future utilization of built in losses of million generated prior to october  will be limited to million per 
table of contents year 
in addition  the company currently estimates that million to million of the tax benefits related to built in losses may not ultimately be realized 
however  this estimate will not be confirmed until the five year limitation period expires in october analysis of our ability to realize deferred tax assets requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently subjective because it requires the future occurrence of circumstances that cannot be predicted with certainty 
while we maintained a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset for financial reporting purposes at december   the net operating losses and net realized built in losses are able to be carried forward for income tax purposes up to twenty years 
thus  to the extent we generate sufficient taxable income in the future  we will be able to utilize some of the net operating losses and net realized built in losses for income tax purposes and reverse a portion of the valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes 
the determination of how much of the net operating losses and net realized built in losses we will be able to utilize and  therefore  how much of the valuation allowance that may be reversed and the timing is based on our future results of operations and the amount and timing of actual loan charge offs and asset writedowns 
additionally  for regulatory capital purposes  deferred tax assets are limited to the assets which can be realized through carryback to prior years or taxable income in the next months 
at december   our entire net deferred tax asset was excluded from tier and total regulatory capital based on these criteria 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis for both financial reporting and regulatory capital purposes 
the evaluation may result in the inclusion of a portion of the deferred tax asset in our regulatory capital calculation in future periods in an amount that is different from the amount determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
defined benefit pension plan we account for our defined benefit pension plan pension plan on an actuarial basis 
pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and the related impacts on income 
in particular  the assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets are important elements of defined benefit pension plan expense and asset liability measurement with regard to the pension plan 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension plan expense while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension plan expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider asset allocations and historical returns on various categories of pension plan assets 
both of these key assumptions are sensitive to changes 
in addition  the pension plan includes common stock of the company  the value of which is subject to change based on trading prices as listed on nasdaq 
at december   the fair value of the company s common stock included in the pension plan was of the total fair value of assets of the pension plan 
additionally  we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover and update such factors to reflect experience and expectations for the future 
effective  we ceased accruing pension benefits for teammates under our pension plan 
although no previously accrued benefits were lost  teammates no longer accrue benefits for service subsequent to amounts recognized within our consolidated financial statements with regard to this change to our pension plan were also computed on an actuarial basis 
because of the considerable judgment necessary in the determination of all such assumptions  actual results in any given year may differ from actuarial assumptions 
in addition  we may decide to terminate the pension plan which  based on the valuation of the pension plan assets and actuarial valuation of the accrued benefits to the participants at that time  would require a cash contribution to the pension plan for any resulting unfunded liability 
while not computed on such basis  the unfunded liability was million at december  fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record recurring fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
additionally  we may be required to record other assets at fair value on a 
table of contents nonrecurring basis 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or writedowns of individual assets 
further  we include in the notes to the consolidated financial statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and the related impact to income 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value  we disclose an estimate of their fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
accounting standards establish a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market derived or market based information obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of market data 
the three levels of inputs that are used to classify fair value measurements are as follows level valuation is based on quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level instruments generally include securities traded on active exchange markets  such as the new york stock exchange or nasdaq  as well as securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over the counter markets 
instruments we classify as level are instruments that have been priced directly from dealer trading desks and represent actual prices at which such securities have traded within active markets 
level instruments also include other loans held for sale and foreclosed real estate for which binding sales contracts have been entered into as of the balance sheet date 
level valuation is based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques  such as matrix pricing  for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
instruments we classify as level include securities that are valued based on pricing models that use relevant observable information generated by transactions that have occurred in the market place that involve similar securities 
level instruments also include mortgage loans held for sale that are valued based on prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics and other loans held for sale  impaired loans and foreclosed real estate valued by independent collateral appraisals based on recent sales of comparable properties 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect our estimate of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
we attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
when available  we use quoted market prices to measure fair value 
if market prices are not available  fair value measurement is based on models that use primarily market based or independently sourced market parameters 
most of our financial instruments use either level or level measurements to determine fair value adjustments recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
however  in certain cases  when observable market inputs for model based valuation techniques may not be readily available  we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of an instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data 
for example  reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable 
when significant 
table of contents adjustments to available observable inputs are required  it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs 
when an active market for a security does not exist  the use of management estimates that incorporate current market participant expectations of future cash flows and appropriate risk premiums is acceptable 
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in level or level if fair value measurement is based upon recent observable market activity of such assets or comparable assets other than forced or distressed transactions that occur in sufficient volume and do not require significant adjustment using unobservable inputs  those assets are classified as level if not  they are classified as level making this assessment requires significant judgment 
executive summary of strategic project plan and financial results strategic project plan in response to the challenging economic environment and our negative financial results and in preparation for a potential formal agreement from the banking regulatory agencies  in june the board of directors and management adopted and began executing a proactive and aggressive strategic project plan to address issues related to credit quality  liquidity  earnings and capital 
execution of the strategic project plan is being overseen by the regulatory oversight and risk management committee of the board of directors 
during  and  we continued to be impacted by the negative financial conditions of our clients  further deterioration in real estate values and the economy in general 
however  in spite of these external challenges  we have made substantial progress with regard to the execution of the strategic project plan  and  in the third quarter  we recorded our first quarter of profitability since the first quarter  and we reported a quarterly profit in the fourth quarter as well 
since june  we have been  and continue to be  keenly focused on executing the strategic project plan 
as an extension of this strategic project plan  in  we launched a company wide project to determine the strategic and tactical actions necessary to align our infrastructure and expense base with our current balance sheet size and the underlying revenue generating capacity of the franchise 
this project was focused on strategic and tactical actions such as business reviews  headcount rationalization and process improvement and automation 
in december  we announced plans to reduce our branch network by four branches through sale or consolidation into existing branches 
in january  we entered into an agreement to sell the rock hill and blacksburg branches 
the sale was consummated on july  and resulted in a gain  net of transaction costs  of thousand that was recognized in the third quarter we also consolidated the north harper branch into the west main branch in laurens county and the south main branch into the montague branch in greenwood county on march  these branch consolidations resulted in larger branches in laurens and greenwood counties  and we believe these consolidations will create synergies to more effectively and efficiently serve our clients in those markets 
in addition  the exit from the rock hill market positions us to focus on and invest in our core markets in the upstate 
primarily as a result of the actions related to the branch network  outsourcing of certain operational functions and attrition during and for which the positions were not replaced  we experienced an overall reduction in headcount from the peak of at december  to at december  also  in addition to reductions in compensation and benefits implemented in previous years  we executed a number of additional actions to reduce our compensation and benefits expense in the branch  headcount and compensation and benefit reductions are part of our proactive strategic project plan to align further our infrastructure and expense base with our current balance sheet size  scope of business activities and underlying revenue generating capacity 

table of contents additionally  sales of problem assets  including the sales entered into during  were part of our strategic efforts to aggressively reduce problem assets and  therefore  accelerate our return to profitability through avoidance of potential future writedowns resulting from receipt of ongoing appraisals and reductions in the related carrying costs such as legal expenses  property taxes  property insurance and other costs incurred to resolve the problem assets and protect the collateral value 
the successful execution of these strategic actions contributed significantly to our return to quarterly profitability during and is expected to provide greater stability and predictability in future earnings through a reduction in exposure to changes in real estate values and related operating costs 
we believe that raising capital in  combined with our proactive and aggressive focus on credit quality  reducing problem assets  earnings improvements and garnering increased market share due to the market disruption in our markets were the significant factors contributing to our return to quarterly profitability during as of december   we have made substantial progress toward completing the strategic initiatives under the strategic project plan  including significant reduction in problem assets  repositioning the balance sheet from an asset and liability management standpoint  rationalizing our branch network and headcount  refining our infrastructure  focusing on expense reductions and returning to profitability on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we believe our earnings will be more stable and predictable going forward 
however  as disclosed in this annual report on form k  our performance is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  and we can provide no assurances regarding the sustainability of or improvement in future earnings 
credit quality 
as a result of the recent recession and its aftermath  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  construction  acquisition and development real estate projects slowed  guarantors experienced financial stress and credit losses became elevated 
during and  delinquencies increased resulting in an increase in nonaccrual loans indicating significant credit quality deterioration and probable losses 
in particular  loans secured by real estate including acquisition  construction and development projects demonstrated stress given reduced cash flows of individual clients  limited bank financing and credit availability and slow property sales 
this deterioration manifested itself in our borrowers in several ways decreases in cash flows from underlying properties supporting the loans eg  slower property sales for development type projects or lower occupancy rates or rental rates for operating properties  decreases in cash flows from the clients themselves  increased pressure on guarantors due to illiquid and diminished personal balance sheets resulting from investing additional personal capital in the projects and declines in fair values of real estate related assets resulting in lower cash proceeds from sales or fair values declining to the point that borrowers were no longer willing to sell the assets at such deep discounts 
given the negative asset quality trends within our loan portfolio  which began in and accelerated during and  we have worked aggressively to identify and quantify potential losses and execute plans to reduce problem assets 
while asset quality measures remain at historically sub par levels  such measures have generally improved in and particularly as a result of the problem asset sales entered into during actions taken and being taken with regard to our credit quality plan include  among other things we obtained periodic detailed loan reviews of our loan portfolio beginning in the loan reviews were performed by management as well as by an independent loan review firm that reported their results directly to the board of directors  for identified problem loans  we prepared written borrower specific workout plans to determine how best to resolve the loans that could include restructuring the loans  requesting additional collateral  demanding payment from guarantors  sale of the loans or foreclosure and sale of the collateral  we increased our monitoring of borrower and industry sector concentrations and are limiting additional credit exposure to these concentrations  in  we hired a new chief credit officer  re evaluated our lending policies and procedures and credit administration function and implemented significant enhancements 
among other changes  we reorganized our credit administration function  hired additional internal resources and external 
table of contents consulting assistance and reorganized our line of business roles and responsibilities including separate designation of a commercial banking business with more direct oversight and clearer accountability  in and  we hired additional personnel with expertise in problem asset workout and disposition for our special assets department  and we actively marketed problem assets for sale and have made strategic decisions to sell selected problem assets at discounts including the bulk sale of problem assets during credit quality indicators generally showed continued improvement during as we experienced reduced loan migrations to nonaccrual status  lower loss severity on individual problem assets and a significant reduction in nonperforming assets 
we continue to monitor our loan portfolio and foreclosed assets very carefully and are continually working to further reduce our problem assets 
total loans migrating into nonaccrual status declined from million for the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  we believe the level of loans moving into nonaccrual status has declined as a result of our improved underwriting standards and a general stabilization in the economy 
liquidity 
in  we implemented a forward looking liquidity plan and increased our liquidity monitoring 
the liquidity plan included  among other things proactive client deposit retention initiatives specific to large deposit clients and our deposit clients in general  executing targeted deposit growth and retention campaigns 
since june   our deposits have remained stable through our normal growth and retention efforts  and  therefore  we have not utilized any special campaigns 
in addition  given our elevated cash position  we reduced our deposit pricing to allow our higher priced certificates of deposit to roll off as they mature  evaluating our sources of available financing and identifying additional collateral for pledging for secured borrowings 
in  we obtained lines of credit of million and million from two separate correspondent banks  which increased our total available lines of credit to million 
additionally  beginning in june  our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was increased to of total assets 
during the second quarter  we were notified by the federal reserve that any future borrowings from the federal reserve discount window would be at the primary credit rate  and in december  one institution  through which we had an existing correspondent line of credit  increased our line of credit by million  accelerating the filing of our income tax refund claims resulting in refunds received totaling million in and  and during and most of  maintaining cash received primarily from loan and investment security repayments in cash rather than being reinvested in other earning assets 
following the consummation of our private placement in  we prepaid million of fhlb advances and during and into  cash balances were used to fund strategic reduction in high cost time deposits and purchase additional investment securities 
beginning in the fourth quarter  we began increasing cash balances in anticipation of the potential impact of million of maturing time deposits in first quarter at an average rate of as well as the expiration of the tag program on december  we continue to monitor the level of our cash and investment securities balances in relation to our expected liquidity needs 

table of contents capital 
at december   all of our capital ratios exceeded the well capitalized regulatory minimum thresholds and the requirements of the supervisory authorities 
to manage our capital over the last four years  we have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the first quarter  reduced our loan portfolio including other loans held for sale by million and total assets by million since the peak at march   monitored the amount and pricing of time deposit renewals to manage the level of cash balances that are included in our total assets  which influences the amount of leverage capital that must be maintained  evaluated other capital saving alternatives such as branch and asset sales and reducing outstanding credit commitments  and raised million through the issuance of common stock in the private placement and subsequent follow on offering of which million was invested in the bank 
on june  the effective date  we completed a one for four reverse stock split of our common stock 
in connection with the reverse stock split  every four shares of the issued and outstanding common stock of the company at the effective date were exchanged for one share of our newly issued common stock 
fractional shares were rounded up to the next whole share 
unless otherwise noted  all prior period share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
earnings 
we have been implementing a plan that is focused on earnings improvement through a combination of revenue increases and expense reductions 
the culmination of these actions resulted in our return to quarterly profitability during while our return to quarterly profitability is a significant achievement  we continue to execute strategies to address the revenue and expense challenges facing the company and the banking industry in general 
with respect to net interest income  we implemented risk based loan pricing and interest rate floors on renewed and new loans meeting certain criteria 
at december   loans aggregating million had interest rate floors of which million had floors greater than or equal to 
however  as a result of continued low interest rates and competitive pressures  it is more difficult to originate loans with floors in the current environment 
beginning in and continuing through  we introduced loan specials intended to generate additional loan volume for residential mortgage  automobile  credit card  consumer and commercial loans 
in light of the current low interest rate environment  we have also reduced the interest rates paid on our deposit accounts 
since december  we used excess cash to prepay all of our fhlb advances and allowed higher priced cds to roll off as they matured 
cds have decreased million from june  peak quarter end certificates of deposits to december  we have been revisiting our fee structures and introducing new fees to help recover costs incurred to provide services in the new environment that has evolved as a result of the economic downturn  ongoing government oversight and consumer criticism 
recent focus on the level of deposit service charges within the banking industry by the media and the us government has resulted in  and may continue to result in  legislation limiting the amount and type of fees charged to consumers by the banking industry 
many banking organizations are changing their business strategies including revisiting their fee structures and introducing new fees 
we continue to evaluate our fee structure related to all of our products and services 
in addition to these fee structure changes  we are evaluating additional sources of noninterest income 
for example  in  we introduced a new checking account  mypal checking  and a new savings account  smart savings  both of which provide noninterest income from service charges and debit card transactions 
we continue to evaluate and modify the features of the mypal and smart savings accounts as conditions warrant 
in addition  we revised our existing deposit account fees  implemented new deposit account fees and increased our trust fees in in the fourth quarter  we evaluated all of 
table of contents our retail and commercial deposit accounts and began re implementing service charges for a number of clients beginning in the first quarter during  we hired dedicated lenders with significant experience in the origination and sale of sba and corporate banking loans to provide additional sources of revenue that are expected to contribute to earnings in future periods 
in  we entered into contracts to sell a significant portion of our problem assets at discounted prices as part of our strategic efforts to aggressively reduce problem assets with such sales concentrated in the second quarter to offset a portion of the resulting credit losses and the resulting impact on regulatory capital  during  we realized gains of million on the sale of million in book value of investment securities 
we identified specific opportunities for noninterest expense reductions and are continuing to review other opportunities for additional reductions 
over the last three years  we have performed process improvement reviews of all significant areas of the company and have implemented a number of recommendations to improve our operating efficiency 
in  we launched a company wide project to determine the additional strategic and tactical actions necessary to align our infrastructure and expense base with our current balance sheet size and the underlying revenue generating capacity of the franchise 
as a result of this project  in we reduced the branch network of the bank by four branches  outsourced certain operational functions and otherwise reduced headcount from the peak of at december  as of december   these strategic actions have been completed  however  we continue to promote a culture of ongoing strategic efficiency that is focused on offsetting the impact of the continuing low interest rate environment  increased regulatory costs and fee income pressures 
during  we implemented technological enhancements intended to further improve risk management  efficiency and profitability 
internal enhancements implemented during include  but are not limited to a new automated server and network monitoring system  a new data archiving system  general ledger  accounts payable  fixed asset and financial reporting system upgrades  and core processing system hardware and enhanced backup capabilities

many of our nonaccrual loans are collateral dependent real estate loans for which we are required to reduce the loans to fair value less estimated selling costs with fair values determined primarily based on third party appraisals of the underlying collateral 
during and  appraised values decreased significantly and continued to be depressed in and even in comparison to updated appraisals received for loans originated from to as a result  our evaluation of our loan portfolio and foreclosed assets beginning in and continuing through resulted in significant credit losses 
while still at a historically elevated level  classified assets declined million from december  and from march  peak quarter end classified assets 
in addition  nonperforming assets declined million from december  and million from their peak at march  the decline during was primarily a result of continued resolution efforts including the problem asset sales entered into during regulatory developments we are subject to certain regulatory requirements and restrictions including requirements to continue to improve credit quality and earnings  a restriction prohibiting dividend payments without prior approval from the supervisory authorities and the maintenance of a specified leverage capital ratio

carrying excess cash has a negative impact on our interest income since we currently only earn basis points on our deposits with the federal reserve as compared to investing this cash in higher earning assets 
during and  we began redeploying this cash by investing in investment securities  prepaying fhlb advances and not pursuing retention of higher priced cd accounts that matured starting in the fourth quarter concentrations and restrictions 
in an effort to manage counterparty risk  we generally do not sell federal funds to other financial institutions because they are essentially uncollateralized loans 
we regularly evaluate the risk associated with the counterparties to these potential transactions to ensure that we would not be exposed to any significant risks with regard to our cash and cash equivalent balances if we were to engage in any such transactions

purchases and redemptions are normally transacted each quarter to adjust our investment to the required amount based on the fhlb requirements  and requests for redemptions are met at the discretion of the fhlb 
we have experienced no interruption in such redemptions 
historically  redemption of this stock has been at par value

investment activities our primary objective in managing the investment portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality  highly liquid investments yielding competitive returns 
we are required under federal regulations to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations 
we maintain investment balances based on a continuing assessment of cash flows  the level of current and expected loan production  current interest rate risk strategies and the assessment of the potential future direction of market interest rate changes

the most substantial risk associated with buying state and municipal investment securities is the financial risk associated with the municipality from which the securities are purchased 
although municipal bonds in smaller municipalities can sometimes be difficult to sell quickly  we do not currently anticipate that we will liquidate this portfolio in the near term 
collateralized mortgage obligations are a mortgage backed security sub type in which the mortgages are ordered into tranches by some criterion such as repayment time with each tranche sold as a separate security 
these mortgage backed securities separate the mortgage pools into short  medium  and long term tranches 
our collateralized mortgage obligations are all fixed rate instruments and absent nonpayment as a result of a credit event  monthly fluctuations in income occur only as there are changes in amortization or accretion due to changes in prepayment speeds 
other mortgage backed investment securities include investment instruments that represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages 
principal and interest from the individual mortgages are used to pay principal and interest on the mortgage backed investment security 
monthly income from other mortgage backed investment securities may fluctuate as interest rates change due to the volume of mortgage prepayments 
sba loan backed investment securities are formed by pool assemblers through the combination of the purchased guaranteed portion of sba loans 
the pool assembler combines sba loans of similar characteristics into a pool in a process similar to a mortgage backed security formation 
the resulting security maintains the same full faith and credit guarantee of the us government 
each month  the security holder receives the pro rata share of the principal and interest payment from the guaranteed portion of the underlying loans 
we use prices from third party pricing services and  to a lesser extent  indicative nonbinding quotes from third party brokers  to estimate the fair value of our investment securities 
while we obtain fair value information 
table of contents from multiple sources  we generally obtain one price quote for each individual security 
for securities priced by third party pricing services  we determine the most appropriate and relevant pricing service for each security class and have that vendor provide the price for each security in the class 
we record the value provided by the third party pricing service broker in our consolidated financial statements  subject to our internal price verification procedures  which include periodic comparisons to other brokers and bloomberg pricing screens
