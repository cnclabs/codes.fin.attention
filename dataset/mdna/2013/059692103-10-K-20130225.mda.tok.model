notes to consolidated financial statements bancorpsouth  inc and subsidiaries december   and summary of significant accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of bancorpsouth  inc the company have been prepared in conformity with us gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and revenues and expenses for the periods reported 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company s subsidiaries are engaged in the business of banking  insurance  brokerage and other activities closely related to banking 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of certain federal and state regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies 
the following is a summary of the company s more significant accounting and reporting policies 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries  bancorpsouth bank and its wholly owned subsidiaries the bank and gumtree wholesale insurance brokers  inc all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation

the company paid interest of million  million and million and income taxes of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
securities securities are classified as either held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are debt securities for which the company has the ability and management has the intent to hold to maturity 
they are reported at amortized cost 
trading securities are debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
they are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
available for sale securities are debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity securities or trading securities 
they are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
gains and losses on securities are determined on the identified certificate basis 
amortization of premium and accretion of discount are computed using the interest method 
during the second quarter of  the company determined that it no longer had the intent to hold until maturity all securities that were previously classified as held to maturity 
as a result of this determination  all securities were classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value as of june  the company reclassified held to maturity securities with amortized cost of billion and fair value of billion to available for sale resulting in an increase in other comprehensive income of million during the second quarter of the company did not have any securities classified as held to maturity at december  and securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
rather  it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
management reviews criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  as well as the reasons for the decline  and whether the company would be required to sell the securities before a full recovery of costs in order to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the impairment is separated into a the amount of the impairment related to the credit loss and b the amount of the impairment related to all other factors 
the value of the security is reduced by the other than temporary impairment with the amount of the impairment related to credit loss recognized as a charge to earnings and the amount of the impairment related to all other factors recognized in other comprehensive income 
securities purchased and sold under agreements to resell or repurchase securities purchased under agreements to resell are accounted for as short term investments and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest 
the securities pledged as collateral are generally us government and federal agency securities 
loans and leases loans and leases are recorded at the face amount of the notes reduced by collections of principal 
loans and leases include net unamortized deferred origination costs and fees 
net deferred origination costs and fees are recognized as a component of income using the effective interest method 
in the event of a loan pay off  the remaining net deferred origination costs and fees are automatically recognized into income and or expense 
where doubt exists as to the collectibility of the loans and leases  interest income is recorded as payment is received 
interest is recorded monthly as earned on all other loans 
loans of  or more that become or more days past due are identified for review by the impairment committee  which decides whether an impairment exists and to what extent a specific allowance for loss should be made 
loans that do not meet these requirements may also be identified by management for impairment review 
loans subject to such review are evaluated as to collateral dependency  current collateral value  guarantor or other financial support and likely disposition 
each such loan is individually evaluated for impairment 
the impairment evaluation of real estate loans generally focuses on the fair value of underlying collateral obtained from appraisals  as the repayment of these loans may be dependent on the liquidation of the collateral 
in certain circumstances  other information such as comparable sales data is deemed to be a more reliable indicator of fair value of the underlying collateral than the most recent appraisal 
in these instances  such information is used in determining the impairment recorded for the loan 
as the repayment of commercial and industrial loans is generally dependent upon the cash flow of the borrower or guarantor support  the impairment evaluation generally focuses on the discounted future cash flows of the borrower or guarantor support  as well as the projected liquidation of any pledged collateral 
the impairment committee reviews the results of each evaluation and approves the final impairment amounts  which are then included in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses in accordance with fasb asc loans identified for impairment are placed in non accrual status 
the company s policy is to obtain an appraisal at the time of loan origination for real estate collateral securing a loan of  or more  consistent with regulatory guidelines 
the company s policy is to obtain an updated appraisal when certain events occur  such as the refinancing of the debt  the renewal of the debt or events that indicate potential impairment 
a new appraisal is generally ordered for loans greater than  that have characteristics of potential impairment  such as delinquency or other loan specific factors identified by management  when a current appraisal dated within the prior months is not available or when a current appraisal uses assumptions that are not consistent with the expected disposition of the loan collateral 
in order to measure impairment properly at the time that a loan is deemed to be impaired  a staff appraiser may estimate the collateral fair value based upon earlier appraisals  sales contracts  approved foreclosure bids  comparable sales  officer estimates or current market conditions until a new appraisal is received 
this estimate can be used to determine the extent of the impairment on the loan 
after a loan is deemed to be impaired  it is management s policy to obtain an updated appraisal on at least an annual basis 
management performs a review of the pertinent facts and circumstances of each impaired loan  such as changes in outstanding balances  information received from loan officers  and receipt of re appraisals  on a monthly basis 
as of each review date  management considers whether additional impairment should be recorded based on recent activity related to the loan specific collateral as well as other relevant comparable assets 
any adjustment to reflect further impairments  either as a result of management s periodic review or as a result of an updated appraisal  are made through recording additional loan loss provisions or charge offs 
at december   impaired loans totaled million  which was net of cumulative charge offs of million 
additionally  the company had specific reserves of million included in the allowance for credit losses 
impaired loans at december  were primarily from the company s residential construction  acquisition and development and commercial real estate portfolios 
impaired loan charge offs are determined necessary when management does not anticipate any future recovery of collateral values 
the loans were evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the loan 
as part of the impairment review process  appraisals are used to determine the property values 
the appraised values that are used are generally based on the disposition value of the property  which assumes bank ownership of the property as is and a day marketing period 
if a current appraisal or one with an inspection date within the past months using the necessary assumptions is not available  a new third party appraisal is ordered 
in cases where an impairment exists and a current appraisal is not available at the time of review  a staff appraiser may determine an estimated value based upon earlier appraisals  the sales contract  approved foreclosure bids  comparable sales  comparable appraisals  officer estimates or current market conditions until a new appraisal is received 
after a new appraisal is received  the value used in the review will be updated and any adjustments to reflect further impairments are made 
appraisals are obtained from state certified appraisers based on certain assumptions which may include foreclosure status  bank ownership  other real estate owned marketing period of days  costs to sell  construction or development status and the highest and best use of the property 
a staff appraiser may make adjustments to appraisals based on sales contracts  comparable sales and other pertinent information if an appraisal does not incorporate the effect of these assumptions 
when a guarantor is relied upon as a source of repayment  the company analyzes the strength of the guaranty 
this analysis varies based on circumstances  but may include a review of the guarantor s personal and business financial statements and credit history  a review of the guarantor s tax returns and the preparation of a cash flow analysis of the guarantor 
management will continue to update its analysis on individual guarantors as circumstances change 
because of the continued weakness in the economy  subsequent analyses may result in the identification of the inability of some guarantors to perform under the agreed upon terms 
the bank policy provides that loans and leases are generally placed in non accrual status if  in management s opinion  payment in full of principal or interest is not expected or payment of principal or interest is more than days past due  unless the loan or lease is both well secured and in the process of collection 
once placed in non accrual status  all accrued but uncollected interest related to the current fiscal year is reversed against the appropriate interest and fee income on loans and leases account with any accrued but uncollected interest related to prior fiscal years reversed against the allowance for credit losses account 
in the normal course of business  management grants concessions to borrowers  which would not otherwise be considered  where the borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty 
loans identified as meeting the criteria set out in fasb asc are identified as tdrs 
the concessions granted most frequently for tdrs involve reductions or delays in required payments of principal and interest for a specified time  the rescheduling of payments in accordance with a bankruptcy plan or the charge off of a portion of the loan 
in most cases  the conditions of the credit also warrant nonaccrual status  even after the restructure occurs 
as part of the credit approval process  the restructured loans are evaluated for adequate collateral protection in determining the appropriate accrual status at the time of restructure 
tdr loans may be returned to accrual status in years after the restructure if there has been at least a six month sustained period of repayment performance under the restructured loan terms by the borrower and the interest rate at the time of restructure was at or above market for a comparable loan 
during  the most common concessions involved rescheduling payments of principal and interest over a longer amortization period  granting a period of reduced principal payment or interest only payment for a limited time period  or the rescheduling of payments in accordance with a bankruptcy plan 
provision and allowance for credit losses the provision for credit losses is the periodic cost of providing an allowance or reserve for estimated probable losses on loans and leases 
the bank s board of directors has appointed a loan loss reserve valuation committee the loan loss committee  which bases its estimates of credit losses on three primary components estimates of inherent losses that may exist in various segments of performing loans and leases  specifically identified losses in individually analyzed credits  and qualitative factors that may impact the performance of the loan and lease portfolio 
factors such as financial condition of the borrower and guarantor  recent credit performance  delinquency  liquidity  cash flows  collateral type and value are used to assess credit risk 
expected loss estimates are influenced by the historical losses experienced by the bank for loans and leases of comparable creditworthiness and structure 
specific loss assessments are performed for loans and leases of significant size and delinquency based upon the collateral protection and expected future cash flows to determine the amount of impairment under fasb asc in addition  qualitative factors such as changes in economic and business conditions  portfolio concentrations of risk  loan and lease growth  acquisitions and changes in portfolio risk resulting from regulatory changes are considered in determining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for credit losses 
attention is paid to the quality of the loan and lease portfolio through a formal loan review process 
an independent loan review department of the bank is responsible for reviewing the credit rating and classification of individual credits and assessing trends in the portfolio  adherence to internal credit policies and procedures and other factors that may affect the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the loan loss committee is responsible for ensuring that the allowance for credit losses provides coverage of both known and inherent losses 
the loan loss committee meets at least quarterly to determine the amount of adjustments to the allowance for credit losses 
the loan loss committee is composed of senior management from the bank s loan administration and finance departments 
in  the bank established a real estate risk management group and an impairment committee 
the real estate risk management group oversees compliance with regulations and us gaap related to lending activities where real estate is the primary collateral 
the impairment committee is responsible for evaluating loans that have been specifically identified through various channels  including examination of the bank s watch list  past due listings  findings of the internal loan review department  loan officer assessments and loans to borrowers or industries known to be experiencing problems 
for all loans identified  the responsible loan officer in conjunction with his credit administrator is required to prepare an impairment analysis to be reviewed by the impairment committee 
the impairment committee deems that a loan is impaired if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the contractual principal and interest on the loan 
the impairment committee also evaluates the circumstances surrounding the loan in order to determine if the loan officer used the most appropriate method for assessing the impairment of the loan ie  present value of expected future cash flows  observable market price or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the impairment committee meets on a monthly basis 
if concessions are granted to a borrower as a result of its financial difficulties  the loan is classified as a tdr and analyzed for possible impairment as part of the credit approval process 
tdrs determined to be impaired are reserved in accordance with fasb asc in the same manner as impaired loans which are not tdrs 
tdrs not determined to have an impairment are reserved consistent with loans of similar risk  performance and structure 
should the borrower s financial condition  collateral protection or performance deteriorate  warranting reassessment of the loan rating or impairment  additional reserves may be required 
any loan or portion thereof which is classified as loss by regulatory examiners or which is determined by management to be uncollectible  because of factors such as the borrower s failure to pay interest or principal  the borrower s financial condition  economic conditions in the borrower s industry or the inadequacy of underlying collateral  is charged off 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
loans held for sale mortgages originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate 
estimated fair value is determined on the basis of existing commitments or the current market value of similar loans 
loan sales are recognized when the transaction closes  the proceeds are collected  ownership is transferred and  through the sales agreement  continuing involvement consists of the right to service the loan for a fee for the life of the loan  if applicable 
gains on the sale of loans held for sale are recorded as part of mortgage lending revenue on the statement of income 
in the course of conducting the company s mortgage lending activities of originating mortgage loans and selling those loans in the secondary market  various representations and warranties are made to the purchasers of the mortgage loans 
every loan closed by the bank s mortgage center is run through a government agency automated underwriting system 
any exceptions noted during this process are remedied prior to sale 
these representations and warranties also apply to underwriting the real estate appraisal opinion of value for the collateral securing these loans 
under the representations and warranties  failure by the company to comply with the underwriting and or appraisal standards could result in the company being required to repurchase the mortgage loan or to reimburse the investor for losses incurred ie  make whole requests if such failure cannot be cured by the company within the specified period following discovery 
during  mortgage loans totaling million were repurchased or otherwise settled as a result of underwriting and appraisal standard exceptions or make whole requests 
losses of approximately  were recognized related to these repurchased and make whole loans 
during  seven mortgage loans totaling approximately  were repurchased or otherwise settled as a result of underwriting and appraisal standard exceptions or make whole requests 
losses of approximately  were recognized related to these repurchased and make whole loans 
at december   the company had reserved approximately  for potential losses from representation and warranty obligations 
government national mortgage association gnma optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing 
at the servicer s option and without gnma s prior authorization  the servicer may repurchase such a delinquent loan for an amount equal to of the remaining principal balance of the loan 
under fasb asc  this buy back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met  at which time the option becomes unconditional 
when the company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional buy back option  the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans held for sale  regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the buy back option 
these loans are reported as held for sale in accordance with us gaap with the offsetting liability being reported as other liabilities 
at december   the amount of loans subject to buy back was million 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
provisions for depreciation and amortization  computed using straight line methods  are charged to expense over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized 
expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
other real estate owned real estate acquired through foreclosure  consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  is reported on an individual asset basis at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
fair value is determined on the basis of current appraisals  comparable sales and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources 
any excess of the loan balance at the time of foreclosure over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
based upon management s evaluation of the real estate acquired through foreclosure  additional expense may be recorded and included in other noninterest expense when necessary in an amount sufficient to reflect any declines in estimated fair value 
gains and losses realized on the disposition of the properties are included in other noninterest expense 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with purchase business combinations 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment 
goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed annually within the fourth quarter for possible impairment  or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified 
if impaired  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
no impairment charges have been recognized through december  see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for additional information 
mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others  known as msrs 
the company records msrs at fair value on a recurring basis with subsequent remeasurement of msrs based on change in fair value in accordance with fasb asc an estimate of the fair value of the company s msrs is determined utilizing assumptions about factors such as mortgage interest rates  discount rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds  market trends and industry demand 
because the valuation is determined by using discounted cash flow models  the primary risk inherent in valuing the msrs is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the estimated life of the servicing revenue stream 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could also produce different fair values 
the company does not hedge the change in fair value of msrs and  therefore  the company is susceptible to significant fluctuations in the fair value of its msrs in changing interest rate environments 
msrs are included in the other assets category of the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of msrs are recorded as part of mortgage lending noninterest revenue on the consolidated statement of income 
pension and postretirement benefits accounting the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using an actuarial model as required by fasb asc this model uses an approach that allocates pension costs over the service period of employees in the plan 
the company also accounts for its other postretirement benefits using the requirements of fasb asc fasb asc requires the company to recognize net periodic postretirement benefit costs as employees render the services necessary to earn their postretirement benefits 
the principle underlying the accounting as required by fasb asc is that employees render service ratably over the service period and  therefore  the income statement effects of the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans should follow the same pattern 
the company accounts for the over funded or under funded status of its defined benefit and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheets and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income  as required by fasb asc the discount rate is the rate used to determine the present value of the company s future benefit obligations for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities at the measurement date with the assistance of its actuary using the actuary s proprietary model 
the company developed a level equivalent yield using its actuary s model as of december  model and the expected cash flows from the bancorpsouth  inc retirement plan the basic plan  the bancorpsouth  inc restoration plan the restoration plan and the bancorpsouth  inc supplemental executive retirement plan the supplemental plan 
based on this analysis  the company established its discount rate assumptions for determination of the projected benefit obligation at for the basic plan  for the restoration plan and for the supplemental plan based on a december  measurement date 
stock based compensation at december   the company had three stock based employee compensation plans 
the company recognizes compensation costs related to these stock based employee compensation plans in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation fasb asc 
the company recognized compensation costs for unvested awards of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see note  stock incentive and stock option plans  for further disclosures regarding stock based compensation 
derivative instruments the derivative instruments held by the company include commitments to fund fixed rate mortgage loans to customers and forward commitments to sell individual  fixed rate mortgage loans 
the company s objective in obtaining the forward commitments is to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the commitments to fund the fixed rate mortgage loans 
both the commitments to fund fixed rate mortgage loans and the forward commitments to sell individual fixed rate mortgage loans are reported at fair value  with adjustments being recorded in current period earnings  and are not accounted for as hedges 
the company also enters into derivative financial instruments to meet the financing  interest rate and equity risk management needs of its customers 
upon entering into these instruments to meet customer needs  the company enters into offsetting positions to minimize interest rate and equity risk to the company 
these derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings 
these instruments and their offsetting positions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the notional amount of customer related derivative financial instruments was million with an average maturity of months  an average interest receive rate of and an average interest pay rate of 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

a portion of the consumer mortgage and commercial real estate portfolios originated through the permanent financing of construction  acquisition and development loans 
the prolonged economic downturn has negatively impacted many borrowers and guarantors ability to make payments under the terms of the loans as their liquidity has been depleted 
accordingly  the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of these loans and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes in real estate values in these areas 
continued economic distress could negatively impact additional borrowers and guarantors ability to repay their debt which will make more of the company s loans collateral dependent

these credit quality indicators include  but are not limited to  recent credit performance  delinquency  liquidity  cash flows  debt coverage ratios  collateral type and loan to value ratio 
the company s internal loan classification system is compatible with classifications used by the fdic  as well as other regulatory agencies 
loans may be classified as follows pass loans which are performing as agreed with few or no signs of weakness 
these loan show sufficient cash flow  capital and collateral to repay the loan as agreed 
special mention loans where potential weaknesses have developed which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected 
substandard loans where well defined weaknesses exist that require corrective action to prevent further deterioration 
doubtful loans having all the characteristics of substandard and which have deteriorated to a point where collection and liquidation in full is highly questionable 
loss loans that are considered uncollectible or with limited possible recovery 
impaired loans for which it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and for which a specific impairment reserve has been considered

in the normal course of business  management will sometime grant concessions  which normally would not otherwise be considered  to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty 
restructured loans identified as meeting the criteria set out in fasb asc are identified as tdrs 
the concessions granted most frequently for tdrs involve reductions or delays in required payments of principal and interest for a specified period  the rescheduling of payments in accordance with a bankruptcy plan or the charge off of a portion of the loan 
in most cases  the conditions of the credit also warrant nonaccrual status  even after the restructure occurs 
as part of the credit approval process  the restructured loans are evaluated for adequate collateral protection in determining the appropriate accrual status at the time of restructure 
tdr loans recorded as non accrual may be returned to accrual status in years after the restructure if there has been at least a six month period of sustained repayment performance by the borrower under the restructured loan terms and the interest rate at the time of restructure was at or above market for a comparable loan 
during  the most common concessions that were granted involved rescheduling payments of principal and interest over a longer amortization period  granting a period of reduced principal payment or interest only payment for a limited time period  or the rescheduling of payments in accordance with a bankruptcy plan

impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
accounting standards require management to estimate the fair value of each reporting segment in assessing impairment at least annually 
the company s annual assessment date is during the company s fourth quarter 
the company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of indicated no impairment of goodwill for its reporting segments as the estimated fair value exceeded its respective carrying value by for the company s community banking reporting segment and by for the company s insurance agencies reporting segment 
therefore  no goodwill impairment was recorded during the company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation for also indicated no impairment of goodwill for its reporting segments 
the company will continue to test reporting segment goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis in the company s fourth quarter  or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified

this basis is consistent with the prior year 
the discount rate is the rate used to determine the present value of the company s future benefit obligations for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate used to discount plan liabilities is determined by matching the timing and duration of expected cash flows of the company s pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments

employee contributions up to of defined compensation are matched dollar for dollar by the company 
employer contributions were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

eligible employees were those hired after december  who worked at least  hours during the plan year and had attained the age of as of december   the k plan was amended and the profit sharing contribution was discontinued 
employer profit sharing contributions were million for each of the years ended december  and fair value disclosures fair value is defined by fasb asc as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances 
the hierarchy is broken down into the following three levels  based on the reliability of inputs level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date 
level significant other observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
determination of fair value the company uses the valuation methodologies listed below to measure different financial instruments at fair value 
an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified is included 
where appropriate  the description includes details of the valuation models  the key inputs to those models as well as any significant assumptions 
available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices  if available 
if quoted prices are not available  fair values are determined by matrix pricing  which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities 
the company s available for sale securities that are traded on an active exchange  such as the new york stock exchange  are classified as level available for sale securities valued using matrix pricing are classified as level available for sale securities valued using matrix pricing that has been adjusted to compensate for the present value of expected cash flows  market liquidity  credit quality and volatility are classified as level mortgage servicing rights 
the company records msrs at fair value on a recurring basis with subsequent remeasurement of msrs based on change in fair value 
an estimate of the fair value of the company s msrs is determined by utilizing assumptions about factors such as mortgage interest rates  discount rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds  market trends and industry demand 
all of the company s msrs are classified as level derivative instruments 
the company s derivative instruments consist of commitments to fund fixed rate mortgage loans to customers and forward commitments to sell individual fixed rate mortgage loans 
fair value of these derivative instruments is measured on a recurring basis using recent observable market prices 
the company also enters into interest rate swaps to meet the financing  interest rate and equity risk management needs of its customers 
the fair value of these instruments is either an observable market price or a discounted cash flow valuation using the terms of swap agreements but substituting original interest rates with prevailing interest rates ranging from to 
the company also considers the associated counterparty credit risk when determining the fair value of these instruments 
the company s interest rate swaps  commitments to fund fixed rate mortgage loans to customers and forward commitments to sell individual fixed rate mortgage loans are classified as level loans held for sale 
loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and are subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments 
estimated fair value is determined on the basis of existing commitments or the current market value of similar loans 
all of the company s loans held for sale are classified as level impaired loans 
loans considered impaired under fasb asc are loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect partial write downs that are based on the observable market price or current appraised value of the collateral  or the full charge off of the loan carrying value 
all of the company s impaired loans are classified as level other real estate owned

fair value estimates  methods and assumptions that are used by the company in estimating fair values of financial instruments and that are not disclosed above in this note are set forth below 
loans and leases 
fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans and leases with similar financial characteristics 
the fair value of loans and leases is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using rates the company would currently offer customers based on the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan or lease 
assumptions regarding credit risk  cash flows and discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market and borrower information 
estimated maturity represents the expected average cash flow period  which in some instances is different than the stated maturity 
this entrance price approach results in a calculated fair value that would be different than an exit or estimated actual sales price approach and such differences could be significant 
all of the company s loans and leases are classified as level deposit liabilities 
under fasb asc  the fair value of deposits with no stated maturity  such as noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and savings  is equal to the amount payable on demand as of the reporting date 
the fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows 
the discount rate is estimated using the prevailing rates offered for deposits of similar maturities 
the company s noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and savings are classified as level certificates of deposit are classified as level debt 
the carrying amounts for federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements approximate fair value because of their short term maturity 
the fair value of the company s fixed term fhlb advances is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows 
the discount rate is estimated using the prevailing rates available for advances of similar maturities 
the fair value of the company s junior subordinated debt is based on market prices or dealer quotes 
the company s federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements and junior subordinated debt are classified as level fhlb advances are classified as level lending commitments 
the company s lending commitments are negotiated at prevailing market rates and are relatively short term in nature 
as a matter of policy  the company generally makes commitments for fixed rate loans for relatively short periods of time 
therefore  the estimated value of the company s lending commitments approximates the carrying amount and is immaterial to the financial statements 
the company s lending commitments are classified as level see note  commitments and contingent liabilities  for additional information regarding lending commitments

the company s directors fee unfunded plan provides that a minimum of of the compensation payable to each director is paid in the form of the company s common stock 
this plan is registered under the company s dividend reinvestment plan and the shares are purchased through the company s dividend reinvestment plan which purchases shares in the open market

performance shares entitle the recipient to receive shares of the company s common stock upon the achievement of performance goals that are specified in the award over a specified performance period 
the recipient of performance shares is not treated as a shareholder of the company and is not entitled to vote or receive dividends until the performance conditions stated in the award are satisfied and the shares of stock are actually issued to the recipient

in management s opinion  these transactions with directors and executive officers were made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present any other unfavorable features 
a summary of such outstanding loans is as follows amount in thousands loans outstanding at december  new loans repayments changes in directors and executive officers loans outstanding at december  mortgage servicing rights msrs  which are recognized as a separate asset on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold  are recorded at fair value as determined at each accounting period end 
an estimate of the fair value of the company s msrs is determined utilizing assumptions about factors such as mortgage interest rates  discount rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds  market trends and industry demand 
data and assumptions used in the fair value calculation related to msrs for the years ended december   and were as follows dollars in thousands unpaid principal balance weighted average prepayment speed cpr discount rate annual percentage weighted average coupon interest rate percentage weighted average remaining maturity months weighted average servicing fee basis points because the valuation is determined by using discounted cash flow models  the primary risk inherent in valuing the msrs is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the estimated life of the servicing revenue stream 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could also produce different fair values 
the company does not hedge the change in fair value of msrs and  therefore  the company is susceptible to significant fluctuations in the fair value of its msrs in changing interest rate environments 
the company has one class of mortgage servicing asset comprised of closed end loans for one to four family residences  secured by first liens

regulatory matters the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by the board of governors of the federal reserve to ensure capital adequacy require the company to maintain minimum capital amounts and ratios risk based capital ratios 
all banking companies are required to have core capital tier of at least of risk weighted assets  total capital of at least of risk weighted assets and a minimum tier leverage ratio of of adjusted average assets

the company s objective in obtaining the forward commitments is to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the commitments to fund the fixed rate mortgage loans 
both the commitments to fund fixed rate mortgage loans and the forward commitments to sell individual fixed rate mortgage loans are reported at fair value  with adjustments being recorded in current period earnings  and are not accounted for as hedges 
at december   the notional amount of forward commitments to sell individual fixed rate mortgage loans was million  with a carrying value and fair value reflecting a loss of approximately  at december   the notional amount of forward commitments to sell individual fixed rate mortgage loans was million  with a carrying value and fair value reflecting a loss of million

upon entering into these interest rate swaps to meet customer needs  the company enters into offsetting positions to minimize interest rate and equity risk to the company 
these derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings

the company exposure to credit loss in the event of such nonperformance is the unpaid principal balance at the time of default 
this exposure is limited by the underlying collateral  which consists of single family residences and either federal or private mortgage insurance 
lending commitments in the normal course of business  there are outstanding various commitments and other arrangements for credit which are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   these included million for letters of credit and billion for interim mortgage financing  construction credit  credit card and revolving line of credit arrangements 
the company did not realize significant credit losses from these commitments and arrangements during the years ended december   and litigation the nature of the company s business ordinarily results in a certain amount of claims  litigation  investigations and legal and administrative investigations and proceedings 
although the company and its subsidiaries have developed policies and procedures to minimize the impact of legal noncompliance and other disputes  and endeavored to provide reasonable insurance coverage  litigation and regulatory actions present an ongoing risk 
the company and its subsidiaries are engaged in lines of business that are heavily regulated and involve a large volume of financial transactions and potential transactions with numerous customers or applicants 
from time to time  borrowers  customers  former employees and other third parties have brought actions against the company or its subsidiaries  in some cases claiming substantial damages 
financial services companies are subject to the risk of class action litigation and  from time to time  the company and its subsidiaries are subject to such actions brought against it 
additionally  the bank is  and management expects it to be  engaged in a number of foreclosure proceedings and other collection actions as part of its lending and leasing collections activities  which  from time to time  have resulted in counterclaims against the bank 
various legal proceedings have arisen and may arise in the future out of claims against entities to which the company is a successor as a result of business combinations 
the company s insurance has deductibles  and will likely not cover all such litigation or other proceedings or the costs of defense 
the company and its subsidiaries may also be subject to enforcement actions by federal or state regulators  including the securities and exchange commission  the federal reserve  the fdic  the consumer financial protection bureau  the department of justice  state attorneys general and the mississippi department of banking and consumer finance 
when and as the company determines it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted  it vigorously defends against such claims 
the company will consider settlement of claims when  in management s judgment and in consultation with counsel  it is in the best interests of the company to do so 
the company cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense  the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against it  its directors  management or employees  including remedies or damage awards 
on at least a quarterly basis  the company assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings as well as certain threatened claims which are not considered incidental to the ordinary conduct of the company s business utilizing the latest and most reliable information available 
for matters where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated  no accrual is established 
for matters where it is probable the company will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company establishes an accrual for the loss 
once established  the accrual is adjusted periodically to reflect any relevant developments 
the actual cost of any outstanding legal proceedings or threatened claims  however  may turn out to be substantially higher than the amount accrued 
further  the company s insurance will not cover all such litigation  other proceedings or claims  or the costs of defense 
while the final outcome of any legal proceedings is inherently uncertain  based on the information available  advice of counsel and available insurance coverage  management believes that the litigation related expense accrued as of december  is adequate and that any incremental liability arising from the company s legal proceedings and threatened claims  including the matters described herein and those otherwise arising in the ordinary course of business  will not have a material adverse effect on the company business or consolidated financial condition 
it is possible  however  that future developments could result in an unfavorable outcome for or resolution of any one or more of the lawsuits in which the company or its subsidiaries are defendants  which may be material to the company s results of operations for a given fiscal period 
on august   a shareholder filed a putative derivative action purportedly on behalf of the company in the circuit court of lee county  mississippi  against certain current and past executive officers and the members of the board of directors of the company
