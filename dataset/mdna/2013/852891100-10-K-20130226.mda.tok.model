risk factors forward looking statements from time to time stancorp or its representatives make written or oral statements  including some of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k and in other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission sec  press releases  conferences or otherwise  that are other than purely historical information 
these statements  including estimates  projections  statements related to business plans  strategies  objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements also include  without limitation  any statement that includes words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  seeks  will be  will continue  will likely result and similar expressions that are predictive in nature or that depend on or refer to future events or conditions 
our forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
they involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties are detailed in reports filed by stancorp with the sec  including forms k  q and k  which may include  but are not limited to  the factors listed in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements of this form k 
as a provider of financial products and services  our actual results of operations may vary significantly in response to economic trends  interest rates  investment performance  claims experience  operating expenses and pricing 
given these uncertainties or circumstances  investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements as a predictor of future results 
we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risk factors risk factors that may affect our business are as follows our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business  may prove to be inadequate for certain of our product lines  we establish and carry  as a liability  actuarially determined reserves to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims 
these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of our future benefit liabilities but instead are estimates based on assumptions  which can be materially affected by changes in the economy  changes in social perceptions about work ethics  emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability  emerging or changing health issues and changes in industry regulation 
claims experience on our products can fluctuate widely from period to period 
if actual events vary materially from our assumptions used when establishing the reserves to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims  we may be required to increase our reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect our financial results our long term disability products provide coverage for claims incurred during the policy period 
generally  group policies offer rate guarantees for periods from one to three years 
while we can prospectively re price and re underwrite coverages at the end of these guarantee periods  we must pay benefits with respect to claims incurred during these periods without being able to increase guaranteed premium rates during these periods 
historically  approximately of all claims filed under our long term disability policies close within months 
however  claims caused by more severe disabling conditions may be paid over much longer periods  including  in some cases  up to normal retirement age or longer 
longer duration claims  in addition to a higher volume of claims than we expect  expose us to the possibility that we may pay benefits in excess of the amount that we anticipated when the policy was underwritten 
the profitability of our long term disability products is thus subject to volatility resulting from the difference between our actual claims experience and our assumptions at the time of underwriting 
we are exposed to concentration risk on our group life insurance business due to the nature of group life insurance coverage  we are subject to geographical concentration risk from the occurrence of a catastrophe 
annual report 
table of contents part i catastrophe losses from a disease pandemic could have an adverse effect on us our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of loss from an occurrence of catastrophic mortality caused by a disease pandemic  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
catastrophe losses from terrorism or other factors could have an adverse effect on us an occurrence of a significant catastrophic event  including terrorism  natural or other disasters  or a change in the nature and availability of or continuation of existing reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows or capital levels 
we may be exposed to disintermediation risk during periods of increasing interest rates in periods of increasing interest rates  withdrawals of annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns 
this process  referred to as disintermediation  may lead to net cash outflows 
these outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates  which may result in realized investment losses 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of commercial mortgage loans  which are relatively illiquid  thus increasing our liquidity risk in the event of disintermediation during a period of rising interest rates 
our profitability may be adversely affected by declining or low interest rates during periods of declining or low interest rates  annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments  resulting in increases in the percentage of policies remaining in force from year to year during a period when our new investments carry lower returns 
during these periods  actual returns on our investments could prove inadequate for us to meet contractually guaranteed minimum payments to holders of our annuity products 
in addition  the profitability of our life and disability insurance products can be affected by declining or low interest rates 
a factor in pricing our insurance products is prevailing interest rates 
longer duration claims and premium rate guarantees can expose us to interest rate risk when portfolio yields are less than those assumed when pricing these products 
mortgages and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates  and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments 
our investment portfolio is subject to risks of market value fluctuations  defaults  delinquencies and liquidity our general account investments primarily consist of fixed maturity securities available for sale fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage loans  real estate and other invested assets 
the fair values of our investments vary with changing economic and market conditions and interest rates 
in addition  we are subject to default risk on our fixed maturity securities portfolio and its corresponding impact on credit spreads 
our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is subject to delinquency  default and borrower concentration risks 
related declines in market activity due to overall declining values of fixed maturity securities may result in our fixed maturity securities portfolio becoming less liquid 
also  our commercial mortgage loans are relatively illiquid and the demand for our real estate owned may remain low due to macroeconomic conditions 
we may have difficulty selling our fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage loans and real estate owned at attractive prices  in a timely manner  or both if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice 
our business is subject to significant competition each of our business segments faces competition from other insurers and financial services companies  such as banks  broker dealers  mutual funds  and managed care providers for employer groups  individual consumers and distributors 
since many of our competitors have greater financial resources  offer a broader array of products and  with respect to other insurers  may have higher financial strength ratings than we do  the possibility exists that any one of our business segments could be adversely affected by competition  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business financial strength ratings are gauges of our claims paying ability and are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
in addition  ratings are important for maintaining public confidence in our company and in our ability to market our products 
rating organizations regularly review the financial performance and condition of insurance companies 
a ratings downgrade could increase our surrender levels for our annuity products  could adversely affect our ability to market our products  could increase costs of future debt issuances  and could thereby have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents our profitability may be affected by changes in state and federal regulation our business is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision throughout the united states us including rules and regulations relating to income taxes and accounting principles generally accepted in the us while we cannot predict the impact of potential or future state or federal legislation or regulation on our business  future laws and regulations  or the interpretation thereof  could have a material effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our deferred tax asset includes net operating losses which depend on future taxable income to be realized and may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes our deferred tax assets include federal  state and local net operating losses 
certain of our subsidiaries as a group have generated losses in recent years 
net operating losses can be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future taxable income 
there can be no assurance that we will generate the future taxable income necessary to utilize our net operating losses 
furthermore  the availability of these losses to be utilized in the future can become limited if certain changes in company structure or income levels occur 
in such a circumstance  we may be unable to utilize the losses even in the event the company generates future taxable income 
our business is subject to litigation risk in the normal course of business  we are a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out of our insurance business and investment operations 
we are from time to time involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings 
while the outcome of any pending or future litigation cannot be predicted  as of the date hereof  we do not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  no assurances can be given that such litigation would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain concentrations in our commercial mortgage loan investments may subject us to losses resulting from an economic downturn while isolated to a small number of borrowers  the concentration of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio assets by individual borrower may expose us to potential losses resulting from an economic downturn 
although we diversify our commercial mortgage loan portfolio by location  type of property and individual borrower  such diversification may not eliminate the risk of such losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the concentration of our commercial mortgage loan investments in california may subject us to losses resulting from the economic downturn our commercial mortgage loans are concentrated in the western region of the us  particularly in california 
currently  our california exposure is primarily in los angeles county  orange county  san diego county and the bay area counties 
we have a smaller concentration of commercial mortgage loans in the inland empire and the san joaquin valley where there has been greater economic decline 
a continued decline in economic conditions in california could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the concentration of our commercial mortgage loan investments in the western region of the us may subject us to losses resulting from certain natural catastrophes in this area due to our commercial mortgage loan concentration in the western region of the us  particularly in california  we are exposed to potential losses resulting from certain natural catastrophes  such as earthquakes and fires  which may affect the region 
although we diversify our commercial mortgage loan portfolio within the western region by both location and type of property in an effort to reduce earthquake exposure  such diversification may not eliminate the risk of such losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be exposed to environmental liability from our commercial mortgage loan and real estate investments as a commercial mortgage lender  we customarily conduct environmental assessments prior to making commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and before taking title through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure to real estate collateralizing delinquent commercial mortgage loans held by us 
compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of affected properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
as a holding company  we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in sufficient amounts to pay dividends to shareholders  make payments on debt securities and meet our other obligations we are a holding company for our insurance and asset management subsidiaries as well as for the subsidiaries that comprise our other annual report 
table of contents part i category and do not have any significant operations of our own 
dividends and permitted payments from our subsidiaries are our principal source of cash to pay dividends to shareholders  make payments on debt securities and meet our other obligations 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and interest payments on debt securities will primarily depend upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries 
many of our subsidiaries are non insurance businesses and have no regulatory restrictions on dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries  however  are regulated by insurance laws and regulations that limit the maximum amount of dividends  distributions and other payments that they could declare and pay to us without prior approval of the states in which the subsidiaries are domiciled 
under oregon law  standard insurance company may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business 
oregon law gives the director of the oregon department of consumer and business services insurance division oregon insurance division broad discretion regarding the approval of dividends in excess of certain statutory limitations 
oregon law requires us to receive the prior approval of the oregon insurance division to pay such a dividend 
see part i  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital management dividends from standard 
our ability to refinance debt and raise capital in future years depends not only on contributions from our subsidiaries but also on market conditions and availability of credit in the market we do not have any significant debt maturities in the near term 
our year senior notes of million will mature in august  and our junior subordinated debentures of million will mature in with a call option in we maintain a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility facility for general corporate purposes 
upon our request and with consent of the lenders under the facility  the facility can be increased to million 
the termination date of the facility is june   though  at our option and with the consent of the lenders under the facility  the termination date can be extended for two additional one year periods 
we had no outstanding balance on the facility at december  the facility is composed of a syndication of seven banks 
commitments from the banks toward the available line of credit range from million to million per bank 
should a bank from this syndication default  the available line of credit would be reduced by that bank s commitment toward the line 
our portfolio of investments  including us government and agency bonds and us state and political subdivision bonds could be negatively impacted by us credit and financial market conditions a potential ratings downgrade of us government securities could lead to future deterioration in the us and global credit and financial markets 
as a result  these events may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability may be adversely affected by declining equity markets us and global equity markets heavily influence the value of our retirement plan assets under administration  which are a significant component from which our administrative fee revenues are derived 
sustained equity market declines could result in decreases in the value of the assets under administration in our retirement plans  which could reduce our ability to earn administrative fee revenues derived from the value of those assets 
declining equity markets and low interest rates could affect the funding status of company sponsored pension plans our estimates of liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the estimated future liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and the employee work force 
declines in the discount rate or the rate of return on plan assets resulting from the current economic downturn could increase our required cash contributions or pension related expenses in future periods 
the funding status of the company s pension plans is evaluated annually during the fourth quarter 
our ability to conduct business may be compromised if we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated events we use computer systems to store  retrieve  evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information 
our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions 
system failures  system outages  outsourcing risk or the failure or unwillingness of a service provider to perform could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner and could hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers 
in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  fire  a blackout  a computer virus  a terrorist attack or war  these systems may be inaccessible to our employees  customers or business partners for an extended period of time 
these systems could also be subject to physical and electronic break ins and subject to similar disruptions from stancorp financial group  inc
