item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forward looking statements the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements of tucows inc the company  we  us or our for the years ended december   and and accompanying notes set forth elsewhere in this report 
all financial information is presented in us dollars 
some of the statements set forth in this section are forward looking statements relating to our future results of operations 
our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements 
please see information concerning forward looking statements on page overview our mission is to provide simple useful services that help people unlock the power of the internet 
we accomplish this by reducing the complexity our customers experience as they acquire  deliver or use internet services such as domain name registration  email and other internet services 
our primary distribution channel is a global network of more than  resellers in more than countries who typically provide their customers  the end users of the internet  with a critical component for establishing and maintaining an online presence 
our primary focus is serving the needs of this network of resellers by providing superior services  easy to use interfaces  proactive and attentive customer service  reseller oriented technology and agile design and development processes 
we seek to provide superior customer service to our resellers by anticipating their business needs and technical requirements 
this includes providing easy to use interfaces that enable resellers to quickly and easily integrate our services into their individual business processes  and offering brandable end user interfaces that emphasize simplicity and visual appeal 
we also provide second tier support to our resellers by email and phone in the event resellers experience issues or problems with our services 
in addition  our network operating center provides proactive support to our resellers by monitoring all services and network infrastructure to address deficiencies before customer services are impacted 
we believe that the underlying platforms for our services are one of the most mature  reliable and functional reseller oriented provisioning and management platforms in our industry  and we continue to refine  evolve and improve these services for both resellers and end users 
our principal place of business is located in canada 
we report our financial results as one operating segment 
our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis  principally to make decisions about how we utilize our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance 
to assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies  our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our service offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the key business metrics driving our business 
accordingly  we report revenue in the following service areas wholesale  primarily branded as opensrs  derives revenue from its domain service and from providing value added services 
the opensrs domain service manages over million domain names under the tucows icann registrar accreditation and for other registrars under their own accreditations 
value added services include hosted email which provides email delivery and webmail access to millions of mailboxes  internet security services  publishing tools and reseller billing services 
all of these services are made available to end users through a network of over  web hosts  internet service providers isps  and other resellers around the world 
in addition  we also derive revenue from the bulk sale of domain names and advertising from the opensrs domain expiry stream and the marketing development funds we receive from vendors from time to time to expand or maintain the market position for their services 
retail  primarily our hover and ting websites  derives revenues from the sale of domain name registration  email services and mobile phone service to individuals and small businesses 
retail also includes our personal names service based on over  surname domains that allows roughly two thirds of americans to purchase an email address based on their last name 
portfolio generates advertising revenue from our domain name portfolio and from our two large advertising supported websites  butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com 
we also generate revenue by offering names in our domain portfolio for resale via our reseller network and other channels 
our business model is characterized primarily by non refundable  up front payments  which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow 
for the years ended december   and  we reported revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  our opensrs domain service offering accounted for  and of our total revenue  respectively 
key business metrics we regularly review a number of business metrics  including the following key metrics to  assist us in evaluating our business  measure the performance of our business model  identify trends impacting our business  determine resource allocations  formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions 
the following table sets forth  the key business metrics which we believe are the primary indicators of our performance for the periods presented year ended december  in s total new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations provisioned domain names under management provisioned on behalf of tucows provisioned on behalf of accredited registrars total domain names under management for a discussion of these period to period changes in the domains provisioned and domains under management and how they impacted our financial results see the net revenue discussion below 
opportunities  challenges and risks the increased competition in the market for internet services in recent years  which the company expects will continue to intensify in the short and long term  poses a material risk for the company 
as new registrars are introduced  existing competitors expand service offerings and competitors offer price discounts to gain market share  the company faces pricing pressure  which can adversely impact its revenues and profitability 
to address these risks  the company has focused on leveraging the scalability of its infrastructure and its ability to provide proactive and attentive customer service to aggressively compete to attract new customers and to maintain existing customers 
our direct costs to register domain names on behalf of our customers are almost exclusively controlled by registries such as verisign and by icann 
verisign provides all the registry services operations for the 
com  
net  
cc  
tv and 
name domain names 
icann is a private sector  not for profit corporation formed to oversee a number of internet related tasks  including domain registrations for which it collects fees 
the market for wholesale registrar services is both price sensitive and competitive  particularly for large volume customers  such as large web hosting companies and owners of large portfolios of domain names 
we have a relatively limited ability to increase the pricing of domain name registrations without negatively impacting our ability to maintain or grow our customer base 
we are participating in icann s new gtld program to own and or operate up to four of our own gtld registries 
the new gtld program is expected to result in the delegation of new gtlds commencing in the new gtld program goals include enhancing competition and consumer choice  and enabling the benefits of innovation via the introduction of a wide range of new gtlds 
we believe that such expansion  once completed  will result in an increase in the number of domains we register and related revenues commencing in in addition  while the delegation of new gtlds could substantially change the domain name industry in unexpected ways  we believe that the new gtld program will provide us with new revenue opportunities commencing in under the terms of the new gtld program  in april we paid the required million application fee in support of our application for six domain strings under icann new gtld program 
a declining percentage of these evaluation fees are refundable if any application is withdrawn prior to our executing a registry agreement with icann 
in may we withdrew two of our applications and under the terms of the new gtld application process have received a full refund of million against these applications 
while there can be no assurance that we will be awarded any gtlds  we have determined that the applications embody probable economic benefit and they have been capitalized and are included in prepaid expenses and deposits at september  as part of the new gtld program  we may elect to receive partial cash refunds for certain gtld applications  and to the extent we elect to sell or dispose of certain gtld applications throughout the process  we may also incur gains or losses on amounts invested 
gains on the sale of our interest in gtlds will be recognized when realized  while losses will be recognized when deemed probable 
upon the delegation of operator rights for each gtld by icann  which we expect to commence in  gtld application fees will be reclassified as finite lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life 
from time to time certain of our vendors provide us with market development funds to expand or maintain the market position for their services 
any decision by these vendors to cancel or amend these programs for any reason  may result in payments in future periods not being commensurate with what we have achieved during past periods 
sales of domain names from our domain portfolio have a negative impact on our advertising revenue as these names are no longer available for advertising purposes 
in addition  the timing of larger domain names portfolio sales is unpredictable and may lead to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our portfolio revenue 
our revenue is primarily realized in us dollars and a major portion of our operating expenses are paid in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar may have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in particular  we may be adversely affected by a significant weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar on a quarterly and an annual basis 
our policy with respect to foreign currency exposure is to manage our financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations with the objective of neutralizing some or all of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exchange risk on a portion of our canadian dollar exposure 
we may not always enter into such forward contracts and such contracts may not always be available and economical for us 
additionally  the forward rates established by the contracts may be less advantageous than the market rate upon settlement 
net revenues wholesale opensrs domain service historically  our opensrs domain service has constituted the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration  renewal  transfer and management of domain names 
in addition  this service fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a reseller will engage us  enabling us to follow on with other services and allowing us to add to our portfolio by purchasing names registered through us upon their expiration 
with the acquisition of epag domainservices gmbh epag in august  we now offer registration services for over tlds 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations  our pricing structure for domain names provides visibility into the various fees that make up the cost of a domain name by breaking out the cost of the registry and icann fees separately from our management fee 
effective january  registry fees for the 
com and 
net registrations were increased by the registry to and respectively 
in november verisign renewed its agreement with icann to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the 
com registry until november under the terms of the renewal  verisign agreed to continue the current pricing of per domain name registration throughout the term of the agreement and in december  announced their intention  effective july   to increase the registry fee for 
net to 
the management fee provides our resellers with access to our provisioning and management tools to enable them to register and administer domain names and access to additional services like whois privacy and dns services  enhanced domain name suggestion tools and access to our premium domain names 
we earn fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
domain registrations are generally purchased for terms of one to ten years  with a majority having a one year term 
wholesale opensrs value added services we derive revenue from our hosted email service through our global distribution network 
our hosted email service is offered on a per account  per month basis  and provides resellers with a reliable  scalable white label hosted email solution that can be customized to their branding and business model requirements 
the hosted email service also includes spam and virus filtering on all accounts 
end users can access the hosted email service via a full featured  multi language ajax enabled web interface or through traditional desktop email clients  such as microsoft outlook or apple mail  using imap or pop smtp 
we also derive revenue from other value added services primarily from provisioning ssl and other trust certificates 
in addition  we derive revenue from the bulk sale of domain names and advertising from the opensrs domain expiry stream 
other services included in value added services include web publishing tools  special discounts on rd party services and fees we receive from time to time from vendors to expand or maintain the market position for their services 
in addition  we provide billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions to isps through our platypus billing software 
retail hover we derive revenues from hover sale of retail internet domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses 
retail ting we derive revenue from ting sale of retail mobile phones and services to individuals and small businesses 
portfolio we derive revenue from our portfolio of domain names by displaying advertising on the domains and by making them available for sale or lease 
when a user types one of these domain names into a web browser  they are presented with dynamically generated links that are pay per click advertising 
every time a user clicks on one of these links  it generates revenue for us through our partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay per click advertising parked page vendors 
our parked page vendor relationships may not continue to generate levels of revenue commensurate with what we have achieved during past periods 
our ability to generate online advertising revenue from parked page vendors depends on their advertising networks assessment of the quality and performance characteristics of internet traffic resulting from online advertisements rendered on their websites 
we have no control over any of these quality assessments 
parked page vendors may from time to time change their existing  or establish new  methodologies and metrics for valuing the quality of internet traffic and delivering pay per click advertisements 
any changes in these methodologies  metrics and advertising technology platforms could decrease the amount of revenue that we generate from online advertisements 
in addition  parked page vendors may at any time change or suspend the nature of the service that they provide to online advertisers 
these types of changes or suspensions would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from pay per click advertising 
portfolio names are sold through our premium domain name service  auctions or in negotiated sales 
the size of our domain name portfolio varies over time  as we acquire and sell domains on a regular basis to maximize the overall value and revenue generation potential of our portfolio 
in evaluating names for sale  we consider the potential foregone revenue from pay per click advertising  as well as other factors 
the name will be offered for sale if  based on our evaluation  the name is deemed non essential to our business and management believes that deriving proceeds from the sale is strategically more beneficial to the company 
portfolio names that have been acquired from third parties or through acquisition are included as intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also generate advertising and other revenue through two ad supported content sites  butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com 
these sites primarily derive revenue from banner and text advertising 
in addition  their revenue is derived from software developers who rely on us as a primary source of distribution 
software developers use our author resource center to submit their products for inclusion on our site and to purchase promotional placements of their software 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and methods 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties made by management that may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  fiscal  includes further information on the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the application of these estimates  including those related to the recoverability of investments  useful lives and valuation of intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  fair value measurement of assets and liabilities  product development costs  revenue recognition and deferred revenue and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition policy we earn revenues from the following services wholesale domain service and other value added services  retail hover and ting  and portfolio domain portfolio monetization and sales 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations and other internet services  we earn registration fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
we also enter into revenue arrangements in which a reseller may purchase a combination of services multiple element arrangements 
when a standalone selling price exists for each deliverable  we allocate revenue to each deliverable based on the relative selling price of each of the deliverables 
the standalone selling price is established for each deliverable by the price charged when that deliverable is sold separately by the company which is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
for arrangements where the company does not sell the deliverable separately  the selling price is determined based on third party evidence tpe  which is the price at which a competitor or third party sells the same or similar and largely interchangeable deliverable on a standalone basis 
in instances where vsoe and tpe do not exist  the company uses an estimated selling price for the deliverable  which is the price at which a company would transact if the deliverable were sold by the vendor regularly on a standalone basis 
payments for the full term of all services are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
revenue from the sale of domain names consists primarily of amounts earned for the transfer of rights to domain names that are currently under the company control 
collectability of revenues generated is subject to a high level of uncertainty  accordingly revenues are recognized only when payment is received  except where a fixed contract has been negotiated  in which case revenues are recognized once all the terms of the contract have been satisfied 
we also generate advertising and other revenue through tucows 
com and butterscotch 
com as well as advertising revenue from our opensrs expired domain names and our domain name portfolio 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that the minimum number of post presentation impressions we guarantee to customers is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
revenue is also generated from vendors who are seeking to expand or maintain their services market position and is recognized once all the conditions have been met 
changes to contractual relationships in the future could impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 
in those cases where payment is not received at the time of sale  additional conditions for recognition of revenue apply 
the conditions are i that the collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and ii that we have no further performance obligations 
we record expected refunds  rebates and credit card charge backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations 
should these expectations not be met  adjustments will be required in future periods 
we record provisions for possible uncollectible accounts receivable and contingent liabilities which may arise in the normal course of business 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by taking into account factors such as our historical collection and write off experience  the number of days the customer is past due and the status of the customer account with respect to whether or not the customer is continuing to receive service 
the contingent liability estimates are based on management historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of liabilities and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  credit losses have been within our expectations and the reserves we have established have been appropriate 
however  we have  on occasion  experienced issues which have led to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
should these issues occur more frequently  additional provisions may be required 
valuation of intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets the excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities from our acquisitions is recorded as goodwill 
at december   we had million in goodwill related to our acquisitions and million in intangible assets 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
we report our financial results as one operating segment with three distinct service offerings  being wholesale  retail and portfolio 
finite life intangible assets  related to the acquisition of epag in august  are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of two to seven years  and consist of technology  brand and customer relationships 
finite life intangible assets  related to the acquisition of innerwise  inc in july  are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of five to seven years  and consist of brand and customer relationships 
indefinite life intangible assets  acquired in the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june  consist of surname domain names and direct navigation domain names 
we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb s authoritative guidance  which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test 
we complete our goodwill and certain intangible assets impairment test on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill and certain intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
with regards to property  equipment and definite life intangible assets  we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite life intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
there was no impairment recorded on definite life intangible assets and property and equipment during and our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed for our reporting unit as of december   did not result in an impairment charge 
we determined the estimated fair value for our reporting unit using the market approach that is based on the publicly traded common shares of the company to estimate fair value 
the carrying value was greater than the fair value  therefore no impairment exists and the second step was not performed 
the analysis was consistent with the approach we utilized in our analysis performed in prior years 
any changes to our key assumptions about our businesses and our prospects  or changes in market conditions  could cause the fair value of our reporting unit to fall below its carrying value  resulting in a potential impairment charge 
in addition  changes in our organizational structure or how our management allocates resources and assesses performance  could result in a change in our operating segments or reporting units  requiring a reallocation and updated impairment analysis of goodwill 
a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheet 
there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of and accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we apply a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate based on new information that may become available 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical and future levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event that it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period that such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of a recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period that such determination would be made 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the probability that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered to assess its realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  impacting net income or net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues the following table presents our net revenues  by revenue source year ended december  wholesale domain services value added services total wholesale retail portfolio increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  wholesale domain services value added services total wholesale retail portfolio total net revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal 
deferred revenue from domain name registrations and other internet services at december  increased to million from million at december  deferred revenue has been impacted by the transfer of a significant number of names by certain of our customers from our registrar accreditation to their own registrar accreditation 
this required us to recognize all remaining deferred revenue associated with the transferred domain names during the current year 
no customer accounted for more than of revenue during fiscal and  at december   no customer accounted more than of accounts receivable 
significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis  we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 
wholesale during fiscal  wholesale revenue increased by million  or  to million when compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of opensrs domain service revenue increasing by million or to million 
these increases resulted primarily from our success in attracting customers with increased transaction volumes  the impact of the transfer of a significant number of names certain of our customers from our registrar accreditation to their own registrar accreditation  the contribution from the epag acquisition that we completed during the third quarter of last year and the impact of our passing on the registration fee increase implemented in january for registration fees paid to certain registries 
value added services increased by million or to million when compared to fiscal these increases resulted primarily from the sale of domain names and advertising from the opensrs domain expiry stream and increased digital certificate sales 
during fiscal  the number of transactions from all new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations that we processed increased by million transactions to million when compared to fiscal while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will continue to incrementally increase in the long term  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names that we manage 
as of december   the total domain names under our management increased by million to million  when compared to december  this increase was impacted by certain of our customers transferring a significant number of domain names from our registrar accreditation to their own registrar accreditation 
in addition  we provide provisioning services on a monthly basis to accredited registrars who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their own accreditation 
as of december   we managed million domain names on behalf of other accredited registrars  an increase of million compared to the million we managed as of december  the increase is attributable to one of our accredited registrars transferring million domain names they were directly managing under their own accreditation onto our platform 
retail net revenues from retail for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  increased by million to million 
this increase reflects the impact of million in ting mobile device and service sales made during fiscal as well as the success that our retail marketing initiatives and improved websites are having on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones for hover 
as of december   ting had approximately  customers and approximately  mobile devices under our management 
portfolio during fiscal  portfolio revenue decreased by million  or  to million when compared to fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from advertising and other revenue through our two ad supported content sites  butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com decreasing by million and the delivery of third party advertisements on parked pages decreasing by million 
these decreases were partially offset by the increase in sales of domain names from our domain name portfolio 
the decrease in revenue from our ad supported sites was primarily the result of certain of our vendors electing not to repeat market development programs that they undertook during fiscal while parked pages advertising declined as a result of the impact our domain name sales have on our advertising revenue 
the increase in portfolio sales primarily reflects the timing of portfolio domain name sales and may not be repeatable in future quarters 
the market for monetization of domain names is rapidly evolving and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to acquire the same caliber of names for our portfolio from future expiring domains or that names we acquire in future will provide the same revenue impact as we have experienced from past acquisitions 
in addition  the revenue we derive from our portfolio is driven by general macroeconomic factors that affect internet advertising 
our advertising revenues are typically sensitive to economic conditions and tend to decline in recessionary periods and other periods of economic uncertainty 
cost of revenues wholesale opensrs domain service cost of revenues for domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are initially recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the period 
market development funds that do not meet the criteria for revenue recognition under asc customer payments and incentives  are reflected as cost of goods sold and are recognized as earned 
value added services costs of revenues for value added services include licensing and royalty costs related to the provisioning of certain components of related to hosted email  fees paid to third party service providers  primarily for trust certificates and for printing services in connection with platypus

the costs of revenue for ting mobile phone service include hardware the cost of devices sold to our customers and network services our customers voice  messaging and data usage provided by our mobile network operator 
portfolio costs of revenues for our portfolio represent the amortization of registry fees for domains added to our portfolio over the renewal period  which is generally one year  the value attributed under intangible assets to any domain name sold and any impairment charges that may arise from our assessment of our domain name intangible assets 
as the total names in our portfolio continue to grow  this cost will become a more significant component of our cost of revenues 
payments for domain registrations are payable for the full term of service at the time of activation of service and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees and are expensed ratably over the renewal term 
costs of revenues for our larger ad supported content sites tucows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in canada and sell these services in north america and europe 
our sales are primarily made in us dollars  while a major portion of expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of canadian and us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
based on the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure as of december  we are also subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates under our amended credit facility 
we do not expect that any changes in interest rates will be material  however  fluctuations in interest rates are beyond our control 
we will continue to monitor and assess the risks associated with interest expense exposure and may take additional actions in the future to mitigate these risks 
although our functional currency is the us dollar  a substantial portion of our fixed expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our policy with respect to foreign currency exposure is to manage financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations with the objective of neutralizing some of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements 
exchange rates are  however  subject to significant and rapid fluctuations  and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
accordingly  we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk on portions of our non hedged canadian dollar exposure 
additionally  we have hedged certain of our canadian dollar foreign currency exposures relating to our payroll expenses in canada 
based on the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as at june   a one cent change in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates would cause a change of approximately million in the mark to market on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts 
at december   the company had the following outstanding forward exchange contracts to trade us dollars in exchange for canadian dollars maturity date notional amount of us dollars weighted average exchange rate of us dollars fair value january march  april june  july september  october december  january march  april may  total as of december  the company has million of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts which will convert to cdn million 
of these contracts  million met the requirements for hedge accounting nil 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis model for foreign exchange exposure over the three months ended december  the analysis used a modeling technique that compares the us dollar equivalent of all expenses incurred in canadian dollars  at the actual exchange rate  to a hypothetical adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on the market rates in effect during the three months ended december  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in net income for the three months ended december  of approximately million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond our control 
we will continue to monitor and assess the risk associated with these exposures and may take additional actions in the future to hedge or mitigate these risks 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  marketable securities  foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions whom we have evaluated as highly creditworthy and commercial paper 
similarly  we enter into our foreign exchange contracts with major banks and financial institutions 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers  generally granting uncollateralized credit terms to our customers  and maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and our expectation of future losses
