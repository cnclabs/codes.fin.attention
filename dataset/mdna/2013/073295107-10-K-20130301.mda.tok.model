borrowing activities when we have more funds than required for our reserve requirements or short term liquidity needs  we sell federal funds to other financial institutions 
conversely  when we have less funds than required  we may borrow funds from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb  the federal reserve bank of san francisco or our correspondent banks 
in addition  we may borrow from the fhlb on a longer term basis to provide funding for certain loan or investment securities strategies  as well as asset liability management strategies 
the fhlb functions in a reserve credit capacity for qualifying financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and may apply for advances from the fhlb utilizing qualifying mortgage loans and certain securities as collateral 
the fhlb offers a full range of borrowing programs on its advances  with terms ranging from one day to thirty years  at competitive market rates 
a prepayment penalty is usually imposed for early repayment of these advances 
information concerning fhlb borrowings is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may also borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the maximum amount that we may borrow from the federal reserve bank s discount window is up to of the outstanding principal balance of the qualifying loans and the fair value of the securities that we pledge 
at december   the principal balance of the qualifying loans was million and the collateral value of investment securities was thousand  and no borrowings were outstanding against this line 
market area and competition we have banking offices in areas having high concentrations of korean americans  of which are located in the los angeles  orange county  oakland and silicon valley santa clara county areas of california  are located in the new york metropolitan area and new jersey  are in washington  and is in chicago 
we also have five loan production offices located in the dallas  seattle  atlanta  northern california  and denver markets 
the banking and financial services industry generally  and in our market areas specifically  are highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of strong competition among the banks servicing the korean american community  changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the consolidation among financial services companies 
in addition  federal legislation may have the effect of further increasing the pace of consolidation within the financial services industry 
see supervision and regulation 
we compete for loans  deposits  and customers with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions  and other non bank financial service providers 
many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets  are more widely recognized  have broader geographic scope  and offer a broader range of financial services than we do 
economic conditions  government policies and legislation our profitability  like that of most financial institutions  depends  among other things  on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  and the interest income on our interest earning assets  such as loans we extend to our customers and securities held in our investment portfolio  as well as the level of non interest bearing deposits  have a significant impact on our profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as the economy  inflation  unemployment  consumer spending and political events 
the impact that future changes in domestic and foreign economic and political conditions might have on our performance cannot be predicted 

table of contents our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation or preventing recession through its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements  and by varying the targeted federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the nature and impact on bbcn bancorp and the bank of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation and regulations are enacted or adopted which have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies  and other financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently made in the us congress  in state legislatures  and various regulatory agencies 
these proposals may result in changes in banking statutes and regulations and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions  and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
see supervision and regulation 
supervision and regulation general as a california state chartered bank whose accounts are insured by the fdic  bbcn bank is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions the dfi and the fdic 
such supervision and regulation covers substantially all of its business activities  including  among others  capital standards  general investment authority  deposit taking and borrowing authority  mergers  establishment of branch offices  and permitted subsidiary investments and activities 
in addition  while bbcn bank is not a member of the frb  the bank is subject to certain regulations of the frb 
bbcn bancorp is registered with and subject to examination by the frb as a bank holding company and is also subject to the bank holding company provisions of the california financial code 
these regulatory systems are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the fdic insurance fund and the banking system as a whole  rather than for the protection of shareholders or other investors 
the following paragraphs summarize certain of the laws and regulations that apply to us and to the bank 
these descriptions of statutes and regulations and their possible effects do not purport to be complete descriptions of all of the provisions of those statutes and regulations and their possible effects on us  nor do they purport to identify every statute and regulation that may apply to us 
recent developments in response to the economic downturn and financial industry instability  legislative and regulatory initiatives have been  and will likely continue to be  introduced and implemented  which could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry 
we cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or new regulations will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that new legislation or any implemented regulations and supervisory policies would have on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  especially in the current economic environment  bank regulatory agencies have been very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  and this has resulted in the increased issuance of enforcement actions to financial institutions requiring action to address credit quality  liquidity and risk management and capital adequacy  as well as other safety and soundness concerns 
through its authority under the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa  as amended by the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra  the us treasury the treasury implemented the capital purchase program under the treasury troubled asset relief program the cpp  a program designed to bolster eligible healthy institutions by injecting capital into these institutions 
we participated in the cpp so that we could continue to lend and support our current and prospective clients  especially during this unstable economic environment 
under the terms of our participation  we issued million of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a the series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock and thereby became subject to various requirements  including certain restrictions on paying dividends on our common stock and repurchasing our equity securities  unless the treasury has consented 
additionally  in order to participate in the cpp  we were required to adopt certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
upon the merger with center financial  the million of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a that center financial issued to the treasury pursuant to the cpp was converted into a new series of bbcn preferred stock  designated as fixed rate cumulative perpetual stock  series b  having substantially the same 
table of contents rights  preferences  privileges and voting powers as center financial series a preferred stock 
in june  we redeemed million and million of the aforementioned series a and b preferred stock  respectively  that was issued under the cpp 
bank holding company regulation bbcn bancorp is registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act bhca and that capacity is subject to supervision and examination by the frb and its authority to require periodic reports and such additional information as the frb may require  require bank holding companies to maintain regulatory specified levels of capital  which may be increased for individual holding companies if deemed appropriate by the frb see capital requirements  require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank  restrict the ability of bank holding companies to obtain dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks  terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest subsidiaries  affiliates or investments if the frb determines the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary  require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes  regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem securities in certain situations  and approve or disapprove acquisitions and mergers with banks and consider competitive  management  financial or other factors in granting these approvals  in addition to similar federal  california or other state banking agency approvals which may also be required 
the frb s view is that  in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the frb s regulations  or both 
the source of strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies where a bank holding company s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels 
in such a situation  the subsidiary bank will be required by the bank s federal regulator to take prompt corrective action 
see prompt corrective action below 
subject to prior notice or frb approval  bank holding companies may generally engage in  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities determined by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
bank holding companies which elect and retain financial holding company status pursuant to the gramm leach bliley act of glba may engage without prior frb approval in these nonbanking activities and broader securities  insurance  merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb  in consultation with the treasury  to be financial in nature or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature 
in order to elect and retain financial holding company status  all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well capitalized  well managed  and  except in limited circumstances  be in satisfactory compliance with the community reinvestment act cra  which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate 
failure to maintain compliance with these requirements or correct any non compliance within a fixed time period could lead to required divestiture of subsidiary banks or a requirement to conform all of the holding company activities to those permissible for a bank holding company 
bbcn bancorp has not elected financial holding company status

table of contents dodd frank act as required by the dodd frank act  the fdic adopted a new deposit insurance fund dif restoration plan which became effective on january  among other things  the plan raises the minimum designated reserve ratio  which the fdic is required to set each year  to percent from the former minimum of percent and removes the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio which was formerly capped at percent and consequently on the size of the fund  requires that the fund reserve ratio reach percent by september  rather than percent by the end of  as formerly required  requires that  in setting assessments  the fdic offset the effect of requiring that the reserve ratio reach percent by september   rather than percent by the end of on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion  eliminates the requirement that the fdic provide dividends from the fund when the reserve ratio is between percent and percent  and continues the fdic s authority to declare dividends when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar year is at least percent  but grants the fdic sole discretion in determining whether to suspend or limit the declaration or payment of dividends 
the federal deposit insurance act continues to require that the fdic s board of directors consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio annually and  if changing the designated reserve ratio  engage in notice and comment rule making before the beginning of the calendar year 
the fdic has set a long term goal of getting its reserve ratio up to of insured deposits by on february   the fdic approved a final rule  as mandated by the dodd frank act  changing the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on total domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
in addition  the final rule creates a scorecard based assessment system for larger banks those with more than billion in assets and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds percent  but provides for decreasing assessment rates when thedif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds 
larger insured depository institutions will likely pay higher assessments to the dif than under the old system 
additionally  the final rule includes a new adjustment for depository institution debt whereby an institution would pay an additional premium equal to basis points on every dollar of long term  unsecured debt held as an asset that was issued by another insured depository institution excluding debt guaranteed under the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program to the extent that all such debt exceeds percent of the other insured depository institution s tier capital 
many aspects of the dodd frank act  which address a wide variety of banking activities other than deposit insurance  are subject to rule making and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us  our customers or the financial industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments  payment of interest on demand deposits  and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues that those deposits may generate 
bank regulation bbcn bank is subject to regulation  supervision  and regular examination by the dfi and the fdic 
in addition  while the bank is not a member of the federal reserve system  the bank is subject to certain regulations of the frb 
federal and state laws and regulations which are specifically applicable to banks regulate  among other things  the scope of their business  their investments  their reserves against deposits  the timing of the availability of deposited funds  their activities relating to dividends  investments  loans  the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans  borrowings  capital requirements  certain check clearing activities  branching  and mergers and acquisitions 
california banks are also subject to frb regulation o  and federal reserve act sections a and b and frb regulation w  which restrict or limit loans or extensions of credit to insiders  including officers  directors and principal shareholders  and loans or extension of credit by banks to affiliates or purchases of assets from affiliates  including parent bank holding companies  except pursuant to certain limits and exceptions and only on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties 
the federal and california regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate allowances for loan losses for regulatory purposes 
the regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns 
the guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to internal controls  information systems  and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth and asset quality  and compensation  fees  and benefits 
further  the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
if  as a result of an examination  the dfi or the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  the dfi and the fdic have authority to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  
table of contents direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios  which would preclude the bank from being deemed well capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits  restrict the bank s growth geographically  by products and services  or by mergers and acquisitions  enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions  including memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices  require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes  remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties  and take possession of  close and liquidate the bank or appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver under certain circumstances 
under the california financial code and the federal deposit insurance act fdi act  california state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks 
additionally  bbcn bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so called closely related to banking or nonbanking activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries 
further  california banks may conduct certain financial activities in a subsidiary to the same extent that national banks may conduct such activities  provided the bank is and remains well capitalized  well managed and in satisfactory compliance with the cra 
bbcn bank currently does not conduct activities in subsidiaries 
capital requirements the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks that are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  such as loans  and those recorded as off balance sheet items  such as commitments  letters of credit and recourse arrangements 
under these capital guidelines  a banking organization is required to maintain its capital above certain minimum capital ratios  which are computed by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
in general  the dollar amounts of assets and certain off balance sheet items are risk adjusted and assigned to various risk categories 
qualifying capital is classified depending on the type of capital as follows tier capital consists of common equity  retained earnings  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries including trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
in determining bank holding company compliance with holding company level capital requirements  qualifying tier capital may consist of trust preferred securities  subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits for inclusion of restricted core capital elements in tier capital 
tier capital includes  among other things  hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying term subordinated debt  preferred stock that does not qualify as tier capital  and a limited amount of allowance for loan and lease losses 
tier capital consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt 
under the capital guidelines  there currently are three fundamental capital ratios a total risk based capital ratio  a tier risk based capital ratio and a tier leverage ratio 
to be deemed well capitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio  a tier risk based capital ratio and a tier leverage ratio of at least  and  respectively 
at december   the respective capital ratios of bbcn bancorp and bbcn bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed well capitalized 
further information is provided in the schedule in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans 
the federal banking agencies may change existing capital guidelines or adopt new capital guidelines in the future and have required many banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized  in which case institutions may no longer be deemed well capitalized and may therefore be subject to restrictions on taking brokered deposits 
bbcn bancorp and bbcn bank are required by the us bank regulatory agencies to also maintain a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to average total assets of at least 
all other institutions 
table of contents are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
as of december   bbcn bancorp and bbcn bank leverage capital ratios were and  respectively  exceeding regulatory minimums 
the current risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
in december  the basel committee published an agreement among its member country bank regulatory authorities to establish a new set of capital and other standards for major banking institutions  commonly referred to as basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain a heightened common equity tier capital ratio  tier capital ratio  and total capital ratio 
common equity tier capital ratio and tier capital ratio requirements will be phased in incrementally between january  and january   the deductions from common equity made in calculating common equity tier capital ratio will be phased in incrementally over a four year period commencing on january   and the capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  under proposed implementing regulations issued by the united states federal banking regulatory agencies in june  which have not yet been finally adopted  the current bank capital standards would be revised to a requirement consisting of four fully phased in minimum capital ratios  including a ratio of common equity tier capital to risk weighted assets of  a tier capital to risk weighted assets of  a total capital to risk weighted assets of and a leverage ratio of tier capital with certain deductions to average consolidated assets of 
for this purpose  common equity tier capital will consist of common stock and related surplus 
total tier capital will include non cumulative perpetual preferred stock 
the rule proposal would also change the capital standards set forth in the capital category definitions used in the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below to refer to the new capital ratios and increasing the levels of captial required to be considered well capitalized under those regulations 
prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies have issued regulations pursuant to the fdi act defining five categories in which an insured depository institution will be assigned  based on the level of its capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a bank that may otherwise meet the minimum requirements to be classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated instead as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the subsidiary bank will be required to submit to its federal regulator a capital restoration plan and to comply with the plan 
each parent company that controls the subsidiary bank will be required to provide assurances of compliance by the bank with the capital restoration plan 
however  the aggregate liability of such parent companies will not exceed the lesser of i of the bank s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and ii the amount necessary to bring the bank into compliance with the plan 
failure to restore capital under a capital restoration plan can result in the bank s being placed into receivership if it becomes critically undercapitalized 
a bank subject to prompt corrective action also may affect its parent bank holding company in other ways 
these include possible restrictions or prohibitions on dividends to the parent bank holding company by the bank  subordinated debt payments to the parent  and other transactions between the bank and the holding company 
in addition  the regulators may impose restrictions on the ability of the holding company itself to pay dividends  require divestiture of holding company affiliates that pose a significant risk to the bank  or require divestiture of the undercapitalized subsidiary bank 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank may be subject  at the agencies discretion  to more restrictions under the agencies prompt corrective action regulations  including restrictions on the bank s activities 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits of federally insured banks and savings institutions  up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor  through the dif and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries 
the fdic insures our customer deposits 
the dodd frank act permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  on november   the fdic board of directors issued a final rule to implement the dodd frank act that provides temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing accounts from december   through december  this temporary unlimited coverage is in addition to  and separate from  the coverage of at least  available to depositors under the fdic general deposit insurance rules 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors 
since  there have been higher levels of bank failures which has dramatically increased resolution costs of the fdic and depleted the dif 
in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the dif  the fdic has increased assessment rates of insured institutions and may continue to do so in the future 
as of december   the bank s assessment rate averaged cents per in assessable deposits 
on 
table of contents november   the fdic adopted a requirement for institutions to prepay in their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the fdic otherwise determines  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels 
these announced increases and any future increases in fdic insurance premiums may have a material and adverse affect on our earnings 
further  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the dif 
the fico assessment rates  which are determined quarterly  averaged of insured deposits in fiscal these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in the fdic has redefined its deposit insurance premium assessment base to be an institution s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as required by the dodd frank act and revised deposit insurance assessment rate schedules in light of the changes to the assessment base 
the proposed rate schedule and other revisions to the assessment rules  which were adopted by the fdic board of directors on february   became effective april  and were used to calculate the assessment for our fdic insurance expense totaled million in the fdic may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the dif or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank s charter by the dfi 
restrictions on dividends and other capital distributions under the california financial code  the bank is permitted to pay dividends out of the bank s net profits up to the lesser of retained earnings or the bank s net income for the last three fiscal years less any distributions made to shareholders during such period  or with the prior written approval of the dfi  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of i the bank s retained earnings  ii its net income for the bank s last fiscal year and iii the bank s net income for its current fiscal year 
it is the frb s policy that bank holding companies generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year  and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
it is also the frb s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries 
additionally  in consideration of the current financial and economic environment  the frb has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong 
operations and consumer compliance laws the bank must comply with numerous federal anti money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations  including but not limited to the truth in savings act  electronic funds transfer act  expedite funds availability act  the usa patriot act of  the bank secrecy act  the cra  the equal credit opportunity act  the truth in lending act  the national flood insurance act and various other federal and state privacy protection laws 
noncompliance with these laws could subject the bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties  including  fines and reimbursements 
bbcn bancorp and the bank are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices  untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to various penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers  and the loss of certain contractual rights 
on november   the department of justice entered a consent decree cd in the case of the united states v 
nara bank relating to nara bank past indirect auto lending practices 
although nara bank exited indirect auto lending in and bbcn bank exited indirect auto lending as of december   bbcn bank has acceded to the former nara bank obligations under the cd 
the cd will remain in place until the year and prescribes ongoing compliance with the provisions of the equal credit opportunity act 
given the impact the economic environment has had on consumers  fair lending remains a high priority of regulators

risk factors before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere  and the other information contained  in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock will likely decline 
economic conditions in california  new york or other markets in which we operate may adversely affect our loan portfolio and reduce the demand for our services 
we focus our business primarily in korean american communities in california  the greater new york city metropolitan area  new jersey  chicago  and the seattle area 
adverse economic conditions in our market areas have had a material adverse impact on the quality of our business 
a continued economic slowdown in california  new york or other markets in which we operate may have any or all of the following consequences  any of which may reduce our net income and adversely affect our financial condition loan delinquencies may increase  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  the level and duration of deposits may decline  demand for our products and services may decline  and collateral for loans may decline in value below the principal amount owed by the borrower 
we have a high level of loans secured by real estate collateral 
a further downturn in the real estate market may seriously impair our loan portfolio 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by various types of real estate 
there has been a general slowdown in the economy and declines in value in the commercial real estate market in southern california  along with high levels of unemployment 
continued deterioration in the real estate market generally and in commercial real estate values in particular  along with high levels of unemployment  may result in additional loan charge offs and provisions for loan losses  which may have an adverse effect on our net income and capital levels 
our allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses 
if our actual loan losses exceed the amount we have allocated for estimated probable incurred losses  our business will be adversely affected 
we attempt to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting our loans  but losses nevertheless occur in the ordinary course of business operations 
we create allowances for estimated loan losses through provisions that are recorded as reductions in income in our accounting records 
we base these allowances on estimates of the following historical experience with our loans  evaluation of current economic conditions and other factors  reviews of the quality  mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
if our allowance estimates are inadequate  we may incur losses  our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and we may be required to raise additional capital to enhance our capital position 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for loan losses 
changes in interest rates affect our profitability 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
we derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
in general  the wider the spread  the more net interest income we earn 
when market rates of interest change  the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate 
this can cause decreases in our spread and can greatly affect our income 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations can affect how much money we may be able to lend 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 

table of contents if we lose key employees  our business may suffer 
there is intense competition for experienced and highly qualified personnel in the korean american banking industry 
our future success depends on the continued employment of existing senior management personnel 
if we lose key employees temporarily or permanently  it may hurt our business 
we may be particularly hurt if our key employees became employed by our competitors in the korean american banking industry 
effective as of the close of business on january   alvin kang stepped down from his position as president and chief executive officer 
the board of directors has established an executive council to carry out the responsibilities of the chief executive 
we have retained an executive search firm to initiate a formal search for a new chief executive officer 
environmental laws may force us to pay for environmental problems 
the cost of cleaning up or paying damages and penalties associated with environmental problems may increase our operating expenses 
when a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property  we often purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower 
we may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans 
we also lease premises where our branches and other facilities are located and where environmental problems may exist 
although we have lending  foreclosure and facilities guidelines that are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination  hazardous substances may exist on some of the properties that we own  lease  manage or occupy 
we may face the risk that environmental laws may force us to clean up the properties at our expense 
the cost of cleaning up a property may exceed the value of the property 
we may also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower s operations if we take a role in managing those operations after a default 
we may find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties 
we are exposed to the risks of natural disasters 
a significant portion of our operations is concentrated in southern california  which is an earthquake prone region 
a major earthquake may result in material loss to us 
a significant percentage of our loans are and will be secured by real estate 
many of our borrowers may suffer uninsured property damage  experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs after an earthquake 
those borrowers might not be able to repay their loans  and the collateral for such loans may decline significantly in value 
unlike a bank with operations that are more geographically diversified  we are vulnerable to greater losses if an earthquake  fire  flood or other natural catastrophe occurs in southern california 
an increase in non performing assets would reduce our income and increase our expenses 
if the level of non performing assets increases in the future  it may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
non performing assets are mainly loans on which the borrowers are not making their required payments 
non performing assets also include loans that have been restructured to permit the borrower to make payments and real estate that has been acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of unpaid loans 
to the extent that assets are non performing  we have less earning assets generating interest income and an increase in credit related expenses  including provisions for loan losses 
we may experience adverse effects from acquisitions 
we have acquired other banking companies and bank offices in the past and consider additional acquisitions as opportunities arise 
if we do not adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with acquisitions of other companies  we may incur material unexpected costs and disruption of our business 
acquisitions may increase the degree of such risks 
risks involved in acquisitions of other companies include the risk of failure adequately to evaluate the asset quality of the acquired company  difficulty in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other important business activities  difficulty in maintaining good relations with the loan and deposit customers of the acquired company  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization of expenses related to acquired intangible assets that have finite lives 
liquidity risks may impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans  and other sources may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities may be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that may detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow may also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry or the general financial services industry as a whole 

table of contents increases in the level of our problem assets  occurrence of operating losses or a failure to comply with requirements of the agencies which regulate us may result in regulatory actions against us which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
the dfi  the fdic and the frb each have authority to take actions to require that we comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements  cease engaging in what they perceive to be unsafe or unsound practices or make other changes in our business 
among others  the corrective measures that such regulatory authorities may take include requiring us to enter into informal or formal agreements regarding our operations  the issuance of cease and desist orders to refrain from engaging in unsafe and unsound practices  removal of officers and directors and the assessment of civil monetary penalties 
see item business supervision and regulation for a further description of such regulatory powers 
increased deposit insurance costs may adversely affect our results of operations 
due to the greatly increased rate of bank failures experienced in the current period of financial stress  as well as the extraordinary programs in which the fdic has been involved to support the banking industry generally  the fdic s deposit insurance fund has been substantially reduced and the fdic has incurred substantially increased operating costs 
for these reasons  the fdic has significantly increased the rates of deposit insurance premiums that it charges insured banks  including bbcn bank  which has increased our costs of operation 
additional increases in the deposit insurance premium rates of the fdic or other increases in costs related to deposit insurance may be imposed  which may result in further increases in bbcn bank s operating costs 
changes in accounting standards may affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes and their impacts on us can be hard to predict and may result in unexpected and materially adverse impacts on our reported financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to operational risks relating to our technology and information systems 
the continued efficacy of our technology and information systems  related operational infrastructure and relationships with third party vendors in our ongoing operations is integral to our performance 
failure of any of these resources  including but not limited to operational or systems failures  interruptions of client service operations and ineffectiveness of or interruption in third party data processing or other vendor support  may cause material disruptions in our business  impairment of customer relations and exposure to liability for our customers  as well as action by bank regulatory authorities 
our business reputation is important and any damage to it may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reputation is very important for our business  as we rely on our relationships with our current  former and potential clients and stockholders  and in the communities we serve 
any damage to our reputation  whether arising from regulatory  supervisory or enforcement actions  matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with sec and exchange listing requirements  negative publicity  our conduct of our business or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business 
as we expand outside our california markets  we may encounter additional risks that may adversely affect us 
currently  the majority of our offices are located in california  but we also have seven offices in new york and new jersey 
we also have banking offices in chicago and the seattle area 
our recently closed acquisition of pib will bring our branch total in the seattle area to six 
over time  we may seek to establish offices to serve korean american communities in other parts of the united states as well 
in the course of these expansion activities  we may encounter significant risks  including unfamiliarity with the characteristics and business dynamics of new markets  increased marketing and administrative expenses and operational difficulties arising from our efforts to attract business in new markets  manage operations in noncontiguous geographic markets  comply with local laws and regulations and effectively and consistently manage our non california personnel and business 
if we are unable to manage these risks  our operations may be adversely affected 
adverse conditions in south korea may adversely affect our business 
a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to south korea and  as a result  we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions there 
if economic conditions in south korea deteriorate  we may  among other things  be exposed to economic and transfer risk  and may experience an outflow of deposits by our customers with connections to south korea 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments in or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions in south korea may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers who operate in this region 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make loans secured by real property does not ensure that the value of the real property collateral will be sufficient to repay our loans 
in considering whether to make a loan secured by real property  we require an appraisal of the property 
however  an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made and requires the exercise of a considerable degree of judgment and adherence to professional standards 
if the appraisal does not accurately reflect the amount that may be obtained upon sale or foreclosure of the property  whether due to a decline in property value after the date of the original appraisal or defective preparation of the appraisal  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property and as a result  we may suffer losses 

table of contents changes in governmental regulation may impair our operations or restrict our growth 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies regulate many aspects of our operations 
these areas include the capital that we must maintain  the dividends that we may pay  the kinds of activities that we may engage in  the compensation that we may pay  the kinds and amounts of investments that we can make  the locations of our offices  how much interest we can pay on demand deposits  insurance of deposits and the premiums that we must pay for this insurance  and how much cash we must set aside as reserves for deposits 
the governmental supervision and regulations to which we are subject  which are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than our stockholders  may be changed at any time  and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change 
within the last several years  congress and the federal bank regulatory authorities have made significant changes to these statutes and regulations 
there can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or in their interpretation will not adversely affect our business 
bbcn bank is subject to regulation and examination by the dfi and the fdic and bbcn bancorp is subject to the rules and regulations of the frb 
in addition to governmental supervision and regulation  bbcn bank and bbcn bancorp are subject to changes in other federal and state laws  including changes in tax laws  which may materially affect the banking industry 
if we fail to comply with federal and state bank regulations  the regulators may limit our activities or growth  fine us or force the bank into receivership 
implementation of the various provisions of the dodd frank act may increase our operating costs or otherwise have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the dodd frank act includes  among other things i the creation of a financial services oversight council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation  ii the creation of a consumer financial protection bureau authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products that would affect banks and non bank finance companies  iii the establishment of new capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies  including the elimination  with exceptions for banking organizations having assets of less than billion  of the ability to treat trust preferred securities as tier capital  iv enhanced regulation of financial markets  including the derivatives  securitization and mortgage origination markets  v the elimination of proprietary trading and private equity investment activities by banks  vi the elimination of barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks  vii permanent establishment of the previously implemented temporary increase of fdic deposit insurance to  per insured account  viii the authorization of interest bearing transaction accounts and ix changes in the calculation of fdic deposit insurance assessments and an increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio for the dif 
certain provisions of the legislation are not immediately effective or are subject to required studies and implementing regulations 
further  community banks with less than billion in assets less than billion with respect to trust preferred securities are exempt from certain provisions of the legislation 
we cannot predict how this significant new legislation may be interpreted and enforced nor how implementing regulations and supervisory policies may affect us 
there can be no assurance that these or future reforms will not significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile  which may result in substantial losses for our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including issuing new equity securities  the amount of our common stock outstanding and the trading volume of our stock  actual or anticipated changes in our future financial performance  changes in financial performance estimates of us or by securities analysts  competitive developments  including announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the operating and stock performance of our competitors  changes in interest rates  changes in key personnel  
table of contents changes in economic conditions that affect the bank s performance  and changes in legislation or regulations that affect the bank 
we may raise additional capital  which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we periodically evaluate opportunities to access capital markets  taking into account our financial condition  regulatory capital ratios  business strategies  anticipated asset growth and other relevant considerations 
it is possible that future acquisitions  organic growth or changes in regulatory capital requirements could require us to increase the amount or change the composition of our current capital  including our common equity 
for all of these reasons  and subject to market conditions  we may issue additional shares of common stock or other capital securities in public or private transactions 
the issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock  or the exercise of such securities  could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock  including purchasers of common stock in this offering 
holders of our common stock have no preemptive or other rights that would entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and  therefore  such sales or offerings could result in dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders 
we had suspended declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock 
our ability to declare and pay dividends in the future  as well as the ability of the bank to make dividend payments to us  will be subject to regulatory  statutory and other restrictions 
in march   we announced the suspension of our prior policy of paying quarterly dividends in order to preserve capital and to provide us with increased flexibility to invest in our business 
until november  we were also subject to special regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends under resolutions adopted by the boards of directors of nara bancorp and nara bank after consultation with the dfi and the frb 
our board of directors reinstated our quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue payment of regular cash dividends 
our ability to pay dividends at that time will be subject to statutory and other limitations applicable to us or to the bank 
our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected as a result of future impairment of our intangible assets 
at december   we had million of goodwill 
future acquisitions could result in increases in the amount of our goodwill or other intangible assets 
we assess the carrying value of intangible assets  including goodwill  at least annually in order to determine whether such assets are impaired 
we make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets is less than its carrying amount 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and disclosures to stockholders  to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports and disclosures or prevent fraud  our business may be adversely affected and our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures or difficulties encountered in their implementation may also result in regulatory enforcement action against us  adversely affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview bbcn bancorp  inc  formerly named nara bancorp  inc  is a bank holding company headquartered in los angeles  california 
bbcn bank  formerly named nara bank  opened for business in june under the name united citizens national bank as a national banking association  was renamed nara bank  national association in january and  in january  became nara bank upon converting to a california state chartered bank in connection with its holding company reorganization transaction 
on november   we merged with center financial corporation center financial or center in a merger of equals transaction 
concurrently with the merger  nara bancorp changed its name to bbcn bancorp  inc at the bank level  nara bank merged into center bank  and concurrently with the merger  center bank changed its name to bbcn bank 
we offer a full range of commercial banking and consumer deposit products through bbcn bank  a california state chartered bank 
bbcn bank primarily focuses its business in korean american communities in california  in the new york city metropolitan area  and new jersey 
our november merger with center financial allowed us to expand our organization by adding banking operations in chicago and seattle and strengthen our strategic position in california 
we now have banking offices in california  the new york metropolitan area  new jersey  chicago and seattle and five loan production offices located in the atlanta  dallas  seattle  northern california and denver markets 
we offer our banking services through our network of banking offices and loan production offices to our customers who typically are small to medium sized businesses in our market areas 
we accept deposits and originate a variety of loans including commercial business loans  commercial real estate loans  trade finance and sba loans 
we have discontinued origination of consumer loans  but continue to service such loans in our portfolio 
effective december   upon the merger with center  we resumed originating direct auto loans and started issuing credit cards 
through the merger with center financial  we acquired center bank full service branch offices  of which are located in california  as well as two loan production offices in seattle and denver 
under the terms of the merger agreement  center financial shareholders received shares of company common stock in exchange for each share of common stock of center financial  resulting in our issuance of approximately million shares of company common stock  with a merger date fair value of million 
the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of center financial by nara bancorp in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as detailed in accounting standards codification asc  business combination 
the acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree based on their fair values as of the date of acquisition 
this process is heavily reliant on measuring and estimating the fair values of all the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity 
we engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of center loan portfolio  time deposits  servicing assets  fdic loss share receivable  debt  investments in affordable housing partnerships and operating leases 
additionally  the firm was asked to assist in the determination of the value of the intangible asset associated with the core deposit intangibles 
goodwill of million was recorded  which is equal to the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in connection with the merger 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the center merger 
our principal business involves earning interest on loans and investment securities that are funded by customer deposits and other borrowings 
our operating income and net income are derived primarily from the difference between interest income received from interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities and  to a lesser extent  from fees received in connection with servicing loan and deposit accounts and income from the sale of sba loans 
our major expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  provisions for loan losses and general operating expenses  which primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits and occupancy costs 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as changes in the national economy and in the related monetary policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  inflation  unemployment  consumer spending and political events 
we cannot predict the impact that these factors and future changes in domestic and foreign economic and political conditions might have on our performance 
we have a significant business and geographic concentration in the korean american communities in california  the new york city metropolitan area  new jersey  washington  and chicago and our results are affected by economic conditions in 
table of contents these areas and in south korea 
a further decline in economic and business conditions in our market areas and in south korea may have some impact on the quality of our loan portfolio or the demand for our products and services  which in turn may have some adverse effect on our results of operations 
on november   the dfi and the frb notified the company that they would not object to termination by the boards of directors of the company and the bank of the resolutions previously adopted by the respective boards at the request of such bank regulatory authorities 
the resolutions  which provided among other things for submission to the dfi and the frb of plans for improvements in the operations of the company and the bank and that neither company would declare dividends without regulatory approval  have now been terminated since their objectives have been accomplished 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles affecting the financial condition and results reported in our financial statements 
in each area  we have identified the variables we believe to be the most important in the estimation process 
we use the best information available to us to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities in each of these areas 
investment securities the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or or external pricing services providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
we perform a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to assess whether the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies as well as independent auditors reports from the third party regarding its controls over valuation of financial instruments  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
we also compare the market prices obtained from one source to another reputable independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers for the reasonableness of the initial market prices obtained on a quarterly basis 
we did not adjust any of the prices provided to us by the independent pricing services at december  or we evaluate securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  and our intention to sell  or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
we do not believe that we had any investment securities available for sale with unrealized losses that would be deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail under financial condition investment securities portfolios below 
allowance for loan losses accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which has a material impact on the carrying value of net loans 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical data and management s analysis of other qualitative factors  including the current economic environment as described under financial condition allowance for loan losses below 
acquired loans loans that we acquired are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses 
we considered all classified and criticized loans as credit impaired loans credit impaired loans under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality resulting from the center financial merger 
pass graded loans acquired from center financial and pass graded loans from the fdic assisted innovative bank acquisition performing loans were not accounted for under asc the performing loans were placed in pools with similar risk characteristics and were recorded at fair value at the merger date 
management 
table of contents will periodically reassess the net realizable value of each loan pool and record interest income resulting from the accretion of the purchase discount in accordance with asc credit impaired loans in accordance with asc  credit impaired loans acquired from center were aggregated into pools based on individually evaluated common risk characteristics including whether the loans were currently in nonperforming status and expected cash flows were estimated on a pool basis 
a pool was accounted for as a single asset with a single interest rate  cumulative loss rate and cash flow expectation 
we aggregated all of credit impaired loans into different pools 
a loan will be removed from a pool of loans only if the loan is sold or foreclosed  assets are received in satisfaction of the loan  or the loan is written off  and will be removed from the pool at its carrying value 
the cash flows expected to be received over the life of the pool were estimated by management with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
these cash flows were utilized in calculating the carrying values of the pools and underlying loans  book yields  effective interest income and impairment  if any  based on actual and projected events 
default rates  loss severity  and prepayment speeds assumptions will be periodically reassessed and updated within the accounting model to update the expectation of future cash flows 
the excess of the cash expected to be collected over the pool carrying value is considered to be the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the estimated life of the loan or pool using the effective interest yield method 
the accretable yield will change due to changes in the timing and amounts of expected cash flows 
changes in the accretable yield will be disclosed quarterly 
the excess of the contractual balances due over the cash flows expected to be collected is considered to be nonaccretable difference 
the nonaccretable difference represents our estimate of the credit losses expected to occur and was considered in determining the fair value of the loans as of the merger date 
subsequent to the merger date  any increases in expected cash flows over those expected at purchase date in excess of fair value are adjusted through the accretable difference on a prospective basis 
any subsequent decreases in expected cash flows over those expected at the merger date are recognized by recording a provision for loan losses 
credit impaired loans that met the criteria for nonaccrual of interest prior to the merger may be considered performing upon merger  regardless of whether the customer is contractually delinquent  if we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of the expected cash flows on such loans and if we expect to collect the new carrying value of the loans in full 
as such  we may no longer consider the loan to be nonaccrual or nonperforming and may accrue interest on these loans  including the impact of any accretable discount 
we have determined that we can reasonably estimate future cash flows on any such acquired loans that are past due days or more and on which we are accruing interest and we expect to fully collect the carrying value of the loans 
fdic loss share receivable in conjunction with the fdic assisted acquisition of innovative bank by center financial in  center bank entered into shared loss agreements with the fdic for amounts receivable covered by the shared loss agreements 
at the date of merger with center financial  consistent with center financial accounting treatment  we elected to account for amounts receivable under the loss sharing agreement with the fdic as fdic loss share receivable in accordance with asc the fdic loss share receivable was recorded at fair value  based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows under the loss sharing agreement 
the cash flows expected to be received under the loss sharing agreement were estimated by management with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
the difference between the present value and the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect from the fdic will be accreted into other income over the life of the fdic loss share receivable 
the fdic loss share receivable is reviewed quarterly and adjusted for any changes in expected cash flows based on recent performance and expectations for future performance of the covered portfolio 
these adjustments are measured on the same basis as the related covered loans and covered other real estate owned 
any increases in the cash flows of the covered assets over those expected will reduce the fdic loss share receivable and any decreases in cash flows of the covered assets under those expected will increase the fdic loss share receivable 
increase and decrease to the fdic loss share receivable are recorded as adjustments to other income 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually 
before applying the two step goodwill impairment test  in accordance with asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  we make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we do not perform the two step impairment test 
goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis if circumstances change or an event occurs between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash 
table of contents flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weighting that is most representative of fair value 
based on our qualitative assessment  we were not required to perform the two step impairment test as of december  income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income reported for financial statement purposes  and differs from the amount of taxes currently payable  since certain income and expense items are reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than those for tax reporting purposes 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management evaluates both positive and negative evidence  including the existence of any cumulative losses in the current year and the prior two years  the amount of taxes paid in available carry back years  the forecasts of future income and taxable income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
this analysis is updated quarterly and adjusted as necessary 
section of the internal revenue code imposes limitations on a corporation ability to use any net unrealized built in losses and other tax attributes  such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  when it undergoes a ownership change over a designated testing period not to exceed three years 
as a result of the merger on november   both nara bancorp and center financial underwent a greater than ownership change 
there is expected to be no limitation on the use of either company tax attributes  because as of november  both companies had net unrealized built in gains  rather than net unrealized built in losses 
however  future transactions  such as issuances of common stock or sales of shares of our stock by certain holders of our shares  including persons who have held  currently hold or may accumulate in the future or more of our outstanding common stock for their own account  could trigger future section limitations on the company use of tax attributes 
results of operations general our most significant source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between our interest income and our interest expense 
generally  interest income is generated from the loans we extend to our customers and investments  and interest expense is generated from interest bearing deposits our customers have with us and borrowings that we may have  such as federal home loan bank of san francisco borrowings and subordinated debentures 
our ability to generate profitable levels of net interest income is largely dependent on our ability to manage the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the rates received or paid on them  as well as our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital and liquidity 
as mentioned above  interest income and interest expense may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control  such as economic or political conditions 
we attempt to minimize the effect of interest rate fluctuations on net interest margin by monitoring our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities 
net interest income can be affected by a change in the composition of assets and liabilities  such as replacing higher yielding loans with a like amount of lower yielding investment securities 
changes in the level of nonaccrual loans and changes in volume and interest rates can also affect net interest income 
volume changes are caused by differences in the level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate changes result from differences in yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
the other significant source of our income is non interest income  including service charges and fees on deposit accounts  loan servicing fees  fees from trade finance activities and the issuance of letters of credit  and net gains on sale of loans that were held for sale and investment securities available for sale 
our non interest income can be reduced by net losses on sales of other real estate owned and charges for other than temporary impairment on investment securities and derivative instruments 
in addition to interest expense  our income is impacted by provisions for loan losses  and non interest expenses  primarily salaries and benefits and occupancy expense

the net interest spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets  is referred to as the net interest margin 
our net interest margin is affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  as well as the ratio of the amounts of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  and other competitive factors 
these factors are in turn affected by general economic conditions and other factors including those beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board

specifically  the provision for loan losses represents the amount charged against current period earnings to achieve an allowance for loan losses that  in our judgment  is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  however  actual loan losses may vary in material respects from current estimates

as of december   our lending limit was approximately million per borrower for unsecured loans 
for lending limit purposes  a secured loan is defined as a loan secured by collateral having a current fair value of at least of the amount of the loan or extension of credit at all times and satisfying certain other requirements 
in addition to unsecured loans  we are permitted to make such collateral secured loans in an additional amount up to for a total of of our total capital and the allowance for loan losses for a total limit of million to one borrower

it is our general policy to restrict commercial real estate loan amounts to of the appraised value of the property at the time of loan funding 
we offer both fixed and floating interest rate loans 
the maturities 
table of contents on such loans are generally up to seven years with payments determined on the basis of principal amortization schedules of up to years and a balloon payment due at maturity 
residential real estate loans comprise less than of the total loan portfolio  and are currently not being offered by the bank 
this pool of residential real estate loans is made up of loans funded in prior years that are still being serviced by the bank 
construction loans are also a small portion of the total real estate portfolio  comprising approximately of total loans outstanding 
total real estate loans  consisting primarily of commercial real estate loans  increased million or   to billion at december  from billion at december  primarily due to increased loan originations during the year 
other loans commercial business loans include term loans to businesses  lines of credit  trade finance facilities  and sba loans 
business term loans are generally provided to finance business acquisitions  working capital  and or equipment purchases 
lines of credit are generally provided to finance short term working capital needs 
trade finance facilities are generally provided to finance import and export activities 
sba loans are provided to small businesses under the us sba guarantee program 
short term credit facilities payable within one year typically provide for periodic interest payments  with principal payable at maturity 
term loans usually to years normally provide for monthly payments of both principal and interest 
sba commercial loans usually have a longer maturity to years

non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  accruing loans that are days or more past due  accruing restructured loans and oreo 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they become days or more past due  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
loans may be placed on non accrual status earlier if the full and timely collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  unpaid accrued interest is charged against interest income 
loans are charged off when the collection is determined unlikely 
loans are restructured when  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  the bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
oreo consists of real estate acquired by the bank through foreclosure or similar means  including by deed from the owner in lieu of foreclosure  and is held for sale 
non performing assets were million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in non performing assets in was primarily due to a decrease of million in other real estate owned offset by an increase of million in nonperforming loans 
nonperforming loans increased due to increases in restructured loans but offset by decreases in loans past due days or more  still accruing 
loans past due days or more  still accruing represent acquired loans from center that were recorded at fair value upon acquisition 
these loans are considered to be accruing as we can reasonably estimate future cash flows on these acquired loans and we expect to fully collect the carrying value of these loans 
therefore  we are accreting the difference between the carrying value of these loans and their expected cash flows 
the amount of additional interest income that the bank would have recorded in  and  if non accrual loans had been current in accordance with their original contracted terms  was million  million and million  respectively

the remaining of total loans outstanding represented other states 
although we have a diversified loan portfolio  a substantial portion of the loan portfolio and credit performance depends on the economic stability of southern california 
within the southern california market  most of our business activity is with customers located within los angeles county 
therefore  the company s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in the los angeles county area 
within our cre loan portfolio  the largest industry concentrations are retail building  hotel motel  gas stations  and industrial warehouse 
within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio  the largest industry concentrations are wholesalers  retail trade  and manufacturing 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the bank has implemented a multi faceted process to identify  manage  and mitigate the credit risks that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
for new loans  we fully analyze each loan application package  with experienced reviewers and approvers 
in accordance with current lending approval authority guidelines  a majority of loans are approved by the management loan committee mlc and directors loan committee 
mlc is comprised of the chief executive officer  chief credit officer  chief operating officer  chief lending officer  and eastern regional manager 
for existing loans  the bank maintains a systematic loan review program  which includes internally conducted reviews and periodic reviews by external loan review consultants 
based on these reviews  loans are graded as to their overall credit quality  which is measured based on the sufficiency of credit and collateral documentation  proper lien perfection  proper approval by loan committee s  adherence to any loan agreement covenants  compliance with internal policies and procedures  and with laws and regulations  adequacy and strength of repayment sources including borrower or collateral generated cash flow  payment performance  and liquidation value of the collateral 
we closely monitor loans that management has determined require further supervision because of the loan size  loan structure  and or specific circumstances of the borrower 
when principal or interest on a loan is days or more past due  a loan is normally placed on non accrual status unless it is considered to be both well secured and in the process of collection 
further  a loan is considered a loss in whole or in part when it appears that loss exposure on the loan exceeds the collateral value for the loan  servicing of the unsecured portion has been discontinued  or collection is not anticipated due to the borrower s financial condition and general economic conditions in the borrower s industry 
any loan or portion of a loan judged by management to be uncollectible is charged against the allowance for loan losses  while any recoveries are credited to such allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  we recorded provisions for loan losses of million in  compared to million in and million in during  we charged off million in loans outstanding  and recovered million in loans previously charged off 
total criticized loans at december  were million compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses was of gross loans at december   compared to at december  the decrease in this ratio was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable due to loan originations along with decreases in the specific allowance related to impaired loans 
for loans not classified as impaired loans  general loan loss allowances are provided to cover probable and inherent losses 
the allowance is determined based first on a quantitative analysis using a loss migration methodology 
the loans are classified by type and loan grade  and the historical loss migration is tracked for the various stratifications 
we further segregate these stratifications between loans accounted for under the amortized cost method referred to as legacy loans and loans acquired from center financial referred to as acquired loans  as acquired loans were originally recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses methodology for a detailed description of our loan loss methodology 
impaired loans as defined by fasb asc  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan totaled million and million  respectively  as of december  and december   with specific allowances of million and million  respectively 
none of the acquired center loans were deemed to be impaired as of december  as a result of the fair value accounting 
management and the directors loan committee of the bank review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly 
based upon these evaluations  and internal and external reviews of the overall quality of our loan portfolio  we believe that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to absorb estimated probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  however  no assurances can be given that the bank will not experience further losses in excess of the allowance  which may require additional future provisions for loan losses

table of contents information  and current economic trends 
we analyze loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk 
this analysis includes all non homogeneous loans 
this analysis is performed at least on a quarterly basis 
we use the following definitions for risk ratings pass loans that meet a preponderance or more of the company underwriting criteria and evidence an acceptable level of risk 
special mention loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date 
substandard loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
loans so classified have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful loss loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
loans assigned a risk rating of special mention or worse are referred to as criticized loans and loans assigned a risk rating of substandard or worse are referred to as classified loans

the allowance is based on our regular quarterly assessments 
our methodologies for measuring the appropriate level of the 
table of contents allowance include the combination of a quantitative historical loss migration analysis migration analysis for pools of loans  and a qualitative analysis of subjective factors and a specific allowance method for impaired loans 
the following table reflects our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated allocation of allowance for loan losses amount of allowance for loan losses percent of loans to total loans amount of allowance for loan losses percent of loans to total loans amount of allowance for loan losses percent of loans to total loans amount of allowance for loan losses percent of loans to total loans amount of allowance for loan losses percent of loans to total loans dollars in thousands loan type real estate residential real estate commercial real estate construction commercial business trade finance consumer and other unallocated total the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined by management based upon an evaluation and review of the credit quality of the loan portfolio  consideration of historical loan loss experience  relevant internal and external factors that affect the collection of a loan  and other pertinent factors 
the migration analysis is a formula methodology based on the bank s actual historical net charge off experience for each loan pool and loan risk grade pass  special mention  substandard and doubtful 
the migration analysis is centered on the bank s internal credit risk rating system 
our internal loan review and external contracted credit review examinations are used to determine and validate loan risk grades 
this credit review system takes into consideration factors such as borrower s background and experience  historical and current financial condition  credit history and payment performance  economic conditions and their impact on various industries  type  fair value and volatility of the fair value of collateral  lien position  and the financial strength of any guarantors 
a general loan loss allowance is provided on loans not specifically identified as impaired non impaired loans 
for the acquired loans  the allowance is determined first based on a quantitative analysis using a loss migration methodology 
the loans are classified by type and loan grade  and the historical loss migration is tracked for the various stratifications 
loss experience is quantified for a specified period determined by management and then weighted to give more weight to the most recent losses 
that loss experience is then applied to the stratified portfolio at each quarter end 
during  the non impaired commercial real estate loan portfolio was stratified into ten different loan pools based on property types and the non impaired commercial and industrial loan portfolio was stratified into five different loan pools based on loan type  to allocate historic loss experience to more granular loan pools 
effective june  four additional pools  primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio  were further stratified 
in addition  a new software program was implemented effective june  and is used to track and allocate charge offs to the various loan grades by loan pools 
the quantitative general loan loss allowance was million at december   compared to million at december  additionally  in order to systematically quantify the credit risk impact of other trends and changes within the loan portfolio  the bank utilizes qualitative adjustments to the migration analysis within established parameters 
the parameters for making adjustments are established under a credit risk matrix that provides seven possible scenarios for each of the factors below 
the matrix allows for up to three positive major  moderate  and minor  three negative major  moderate  and minor  and one neutral credit risk scenarios within each factor for each loan type pool 
generally  the factors are considered to have no significant impact neutral to our historical migration ratios 
however  if information exists to warrant adjustment to the 
table of contents migration analysis  changes are made in accordance with the established parameters supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
the credit risk matrix and the nine possible scenarios enable the bank to qualitatively adjust the loss migration ratio or individual specific reserve allocations by as much as basis points in either direction positive or negative for each loan type pool 
this matrix considers the following nine factors  which are patterned after the guidelines provided under the ffiec interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments 
changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff 
changes in the trends of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and changes in trends in the volume of non accrual loans and troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications 
changes in the quality of our loan review system and the degree of oversight by the directors 
changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations 
the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated losses in our loan portfolio 
the qualitative loan loss allowance on the loan portfolio was million at december  compared to compared to million at december  we also establish specific loss allowances for loans where we have identified potential credit risk conditions or circumstances related to a specific individual credit 
the specific allowance amounts are determined by a method prescribed by fasb asc  measurement of impairment 
the loans identified as impaired are accounted for in accordance with one of the three acceptable valuation methods the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
for the collateral dependent impaired loans  we obtain an appraisal to determine the amount of impairment as of the date that the loan become impaired 
the appraisals are based on an as is valuation 
to ensure that appraised values remain current  we generally obtain an updated appraisal every twelve months from a qualified independent appraiser 
furthermore  if the most current appraisal is dated more than six months prior to the effective date of the impairment test  we validate the most current value with third party market data appropriate to the location and property type of the collateral 
if the third party market data indicates that the value of our collateral property has declined since the most recent valuation date  we adjust the value of the property downward to reflect current market conditions 
if the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
if an impaired loan is expected to be collected through liquidation of the collateral  the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent and the amount of impairment is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a loan to be impaired when it is probable that not all amounts due principal and interest will be collectible in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls is determined on a case by case basis by taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
for commercial business loans  real estate loans and certain consumer loans  we base the measurement of loan impairment on the present value of the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or on the fair value of the loan s collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we evaluate most consumer loans for impairment on a collective basis  because these loans have generally smaller balances and are homogeneous in the underwriting terms and conditions  and in the type of collateral 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is supported by a specific allowance amount which is included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
in the third quarter   based on current market conditions  we expanded the criteria for evaluating loans for potential impairment  which resulted in an increase in impaired loans from the prior quarter 
prior to the third quarter of  loans graded substandard were not individually evaluated for impairment and only considered impaired if they were days past due  unless other events existed that qualified the loan for impairment review 
therefore  a substandard credit that was current 
table of contents in its contractual payments  but was classified due to other risk issues would not necessarily be subject to individual review for impairment analysis 
effective september   we expanded the scope of the loans reviewed for individual impairment by including all loans of million or more that were risk graded as substandard  even though such loans were less than days delinquent and were performing under their contractual terms 
effective december   we expanded the scope to include all loans of million or more 
this enhancement to our impairment analysis provided more coverage in terms of current fair values on classified loans as updated market values are required as part of the impairment analysis process 
effective march   we implemented a higher level  preliminary non impairment test  that is applied to loans for million or more that are graded substandard  are less than days past due and accruing  and are not tdrs 
we use a five step test with the following criteria the loan is current with no day late payments in the past six months  the loan payments are the contractual  non modified amount  the financial information that supports payment capacity is not aged over one year  the global cash flow supports the current payment amount at a ratio of or better  and for cre loans secured by a first lien on real estate collateral  the most current ltv is below 
if the loan meets all of these criteria  it is not considered impaired and is subject to the general loan loss allowance for non impaired loans 
impaired loans at december   were million  a net decrease of million from million at december  this net decrease in impaired loans is due primarily to the return of loans back to non impaired status 
the return to non impaired status was based on a review of the current financial information and payment performance 
covered loans on april   the dfi closed innovative bank  california  and appointed the fdic as its receiver 
on the same date  center bank assumed the banking operations of innovative bank from the fdic under a purchase and assumption agreement and two related loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
upon the merger between nara bancorp and center financial  we assumed the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
covered nonperforming assets totaled thousand at december  these covered nonperforming assets are subject to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
the covered nonperforming assets at december  were as follows in thousands december  covered loans on non accrual status covered other real estate owned total covered nonperforming assets acquired covered loans covered nonperforming assets to net covered loans loans accounted for under asc are generally considered accruing and performing loans as the loans accrete the accretable discount to interest income over the estimate life of the loan when cash flows are reasonably estimable 
accordingly  acquired impaired loans that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing loans 
the loans may be classified as nonaccrual if the timing and amount of future cash flows is not reasonably estimable 
investment security portfolio the main objectives of our investment strategy are to provide a source of liquidity while managing our interest rate risk and to generate an adequate level of interest income without taking undue risks 
our investment policy permits investments in various types of securities  certificates of deposits and federal funds sold in compliance with various restrictions in the policy 
securities are classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
the securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities 
all other securities are classified as available for sale 
our available for sale securities totaled million at december   compared to million at december  we had no securities in the held to maturity category at december  or the decrease of million in available for sale securities was caused mainly by pay downs of million  sales of million and called matured securities of million which was partially offset by purchases totaling million 
all of the securities involved in these transactions were classified as available for sale

if either of these conditions is met  an entity must recognize an other than temporary impairment otti 
if an entity does not intend to sell the debt security and will not be required to sell the debt security  the entity must consider whether it will recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
if the present value of expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the security  otti shall be considered to have occurred 
otti is then separated into the amount of the total impairment related to credit losses and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
an entity determines the impairment related to credit losses by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security 
otti related to the credit loss is then recognized in earnings 
otti related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
we evaluate securities for otti on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value of the securities has been less than our cost for the securities  and our intention to sell  or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
we consider the losses on our investments in an unrealized loss position at december  to be temporary based on the likelihood of recovery  the information available to us relative to the extent and duration of the decline in market value  and our intention not to sell  and our determination that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
deposits deposits are our primary source of funds for loans and investments 
we offer a wide variety of deposit account products to commercial and consumer customers 
total deposits increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in deposits during was primarily due to an addition in wholesale deposits to help fund loan growth and the completion of a marketing campaign during the fourth quarter celebrating our first anniversary 
the increases reflect higher balances of non interest bearing demand deposits  money accounts and jumbo time deposits 
at december   we had million in brokered deposits and million in california state treasurer deposits  compared to million and million  respectively  at december  the brokered deposits represented approximately of our total deposits as of december  compared to as of december  the california state treasurer deposits have three months maturities with a weighted average interest rate of at december  compared to at december  although our deposits may vary with local and national economic conditions  we do not believe that our deposits are seasonal in nature

however  if we are unable to replace these maturing cds with new deposits  we believe that we have adequate liquidity resources to fund these obligations through secured credit lines with the fhlb and frb  as well as with liquid assets 
borrowings we utilize a combination of short term and long term borrowings to help manage our liquidity position 
federal funds purchased federal funds purchased generally mature within one to three business days from the transaction date 
at december  and  we did not have any federal funds purchased 
fhlb advances we may borrow from the fhlb on a longer term basis to provide funding for certain loan or investment securities strategies  as well as for asset liability management strategies 
as of december  and  fhlb advances totaled million and million with average remaining maturities of years and years  respectively 
the weighted

subordinated debentures at december   five wholly owned subsidiary grantor trusts trusts established by us had issued million of pooled trust preferred securities trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in the related indentures for the securities 
the trusts used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase a like amount of subordinated debentures the debentures issued by us 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts 
our obligations under the debentures and related documents  taken together  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the obligations of the trusts 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debentures  or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indentures 
we have the right to redeem the debentures in whole but not in part on or after specific dates  at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date

for this purpose  we perform ongoing assessments of our components of capital as well as projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and levels of risk 
on november   we issued  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a the series a preferred stock  having a liquidation preference of  per share  together with a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of nara bancorp common stock at an exercise price of per share  to the united states department of the treasury for gross proceeds of million

liquidity risk includes the risk of unplanned decreases or changes 
table of contents in funding sources and changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimum loss of value 
factors considered in liquidity risk management are the stability of the deposit base  the marketability  maturity  and pledging of our investments  the availability of alternative sources of funds  and our demand for credit 
the objective of our liquidity management is to have funds available to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and the demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs  and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
we manage our liquidity actively on a daily basis and it is reviewed periodically by our management level asset liability management committee alm and the board asset liability committee alco 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our liquidity needs  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet commitments 
in general  our liquidity is managed daily by controlling the level of federal funds and the funds provided by cash flow from operations 
to meet unexpected demands  lines of credit are maintained with the federal home loan bank of san francisco  the federal reserve bank of san francisco and other correspondent banks 
the sale of investment securities also serves as a source of funds 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities  which include customer and broker deposits  federal funds facilities  and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of san francisco and the federal reserve bank discount window 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  proceeds from sale of loans and the liquidation or sale of securities from our available for sale portfolio 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
net cash inflows from operating activities totaled million  million and million during  and  respectively 
net cash inflows from operating activities for were primarily attributable to proceeds from sales of loans and net income

net cash inflows for investing activities during were primarily due to the net cash received from the merger with center 
net cash inflows outflows from financing activities totaled million  million and million during  and  respectively 
net cash outflows from financing activities for were primarily attributable to repayments of fhlb borrowings 
when we have more funds than required for our reserve requirements or short term liquidity needs  we sell federal funds to other financial institutions 
conversely  when we have less funds than required  we may borrow funds from the fhlb or the frb s discount window 
the maximum amount that we are currently available to borrow on an overnight basis from the fhlb and the frb is billion  and currently we have million in borrowings from the fhlb the federal home loan bank system functions as a line of credit facility for qualifying financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the federal home loan bank of san francisco and may apply for advances from the fhlb utilizing as collateral  qualifying mortgage loans and certain securities as collateral for these advances 
the federal home loan bank of san francisco has suspended its regular stock dividend beginning with the fourth quarter of to preserve capital and recently reinstated partial redemptions of excess capital stock in may of at times we maintain a portion of our liquid assets in interest bearing cash deposits with other banks  in overnight federal funds sold to other banks  and in investment securities available for sale that are not pledged 
our liquid assets  consisted of cash and cash equivalent  interest bearing cash deposits with other banks  overnight federal funds sold to other banks  liquid investment securities available for sale  and loan repayments within days 
cash and cash equivalents  including federal funds sold were million at december  compared to million at december  because our primary sources and uses of funds are deposits and loans  the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides one measure of our liquidity 
typically  the closer the ratio of loans to deposits is to  or the more it exceeds   the more we rely on borrowings and other sources to provide liquidity 
alternative sources of funds such as fhlb advances  brokered deposits and other collateralized borrowings  that provide liquidity as needed from diverse liability sources are an important part of our asset liability management strategy 
for  our gross loan to deposit ratio averaged  compared to an average ratio of and for and we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our day to day cash flow requirements 
at december   we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
as of december   we are not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 

table of contents off balance sheet activities and contractual obligations the bank routinely engages in activities that involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk that are not reflected  in whole or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities are part of our normal course of business and include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  interest rate swap contracts  operating leases and long term debt 
traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these activities may require us to make cash payments to third parties in the event specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts represent the extent of our exposure in these off balance sheet activities 
however  since certain off balance sheet commitments  particularly standby letters of credit  are expected to expire or be only partially used  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of our customers 
the bank also has entered into interest rate swap and cap contracts where we are required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
we utilize interest rate swap and cap contracts to help manage the risk of changing interest rates 
our accounting for interest rate swap and cap contracts is discussed below under item a

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of our asset and liability management activities is to improve our earnings by adjusting the type and mix of assets and liabilities to effectively address changing conditions and risks 
through overall management of our balance sheet and by controlling various risks  we seek to optimize our financial returns within safe and sound parameters 
our operating strategies for attaining this objective include managing our net interest margin through appropriate risk return pricing of assets and liabilities and emphasizing growth in retail deposits  as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities  to reduce our cost of funds 
we also seek to improve earnings by controlling non interest expense  and enhancing non interest income 
we use risk management instruments to modify interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities to hedge against our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  reducing the effects these fluctuations might have on associated cash flows or values 
we also perform periodic internal analyses to measure  evaluate and monitor market risk 
interest rate risk 
table of contents market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to the fair value of our assets and liabilities  or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk impacting us 
interest rate risk occurs when interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not reprice simultaneously or at the same rate of interest or in equal volume 
a key objective of our asset and liability management is to manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash flows  values of our assets and liabilities  and market interest rate movements 
the management of our interest rate risk is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors of the bank 
the board delegates responsibility for interest rate risk management to the asset liability committee alco of the board and the asset and liability management committee alm  which is composed of the bank s senior executives and other designated officers 
the fundamental objective of our alm is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
the alm meets regularly to monitor the interest rate risk  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and fair values of assets and liabilities  and our investment activities and directs changes in the composition of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the alm reports at least quarterly to the alco 
our strategy has been to reduce the sensitivity of our earnings to interest rate fluctuations by more closely matching the effective maturities or repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
certain assets and liabilities  however  may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
further  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind 
we consider the anticipated effects of these factors when implementing our interest rate risk management objectives 
swaps and caps as part of our asset and liability management strategy  we may enter into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
interest rate swaps and caps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a three year interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of million 
under this cap agreement  we receive quarterly payments from the counterparty when the quarterly resetting month london interbank offered rate exceeds the strike level of 
the upfront fee paid to the counterparty in entering into this interest rate cap agreement was thousand 
the interest rate cap agreement is considered free standing due to non designation of a hedge relationship to any of its financial assets or liabilities 
under fasb asc  valuation gains or losses on interest rate caps not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in earnings 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate caps was and we recognized mark to market losses on valuation of thousand in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on swaps and caps 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements at december  interest rate sensitivity our monitoring activities related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and the use of a simulation model 
while traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the statement of financial condition  it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time 
accordingly  we combine the use of gap analysis with the use of a simulation model  which provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within that same time period 
a positive cumulative gap suggests that earnings will increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall 
a negative cumulative gap suggests that earnings will increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise

the simulation model discussed above provides our alm with the ability to simulate our net interest income 
in order to measure  at december   the sensitivity of our forecasted net interest income to changing interest rates  both in rising and falling interest rate scenarios  were projected and compared to base market interest rate forecasts 
one application of our simulation model measures the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from our assets and liabilities  defined as our market value of equity 
this analysis assesses the changes in market values of interest rate sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase in market interest rates 
our net interest income and market value of equity exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates are illustrated in the following table 
december  december  simulated rate changes estimated net interest income sensitivity market value of equity volatility estimated net interest income sensitivity market value of equity volatility basis points basis points basis points basis points the estimated sensitivity does not necessarily represent our forecast of future results and the estimated results may not be indicative of actual changes to our net interest income 
these estimates are based upon a number of assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayment on loans and securities  pricing strategies on loans and deposits  and replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while the assumptions used are based on current economic and local market conditions  there is no assurance as to the predictive nature of these conditions including how customer preferences or competitor influences may change 
the alco  which oversees our interest rate risk management  has established the exposure limits for acceptable changes in net interest income and market value of equity related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
given the limitations of the analyses  management believes that these hypothetical changes are considered tolerable and manageable as of december
