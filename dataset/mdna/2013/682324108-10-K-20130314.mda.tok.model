overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer 
our goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients 
our cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells  while our small molecule compounds are designed to inhibit the activity of specific cancer related proteins 
we are advancing our product candidates through in house development efforts and strategic collaborations 
our lead cancer vaccine product candidate  l blp formerly known as stimuvax  is being evaluated for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have granted an exclusive  worldwide license to merck kgaa of darmstadt  germany  or merck kgaa  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of l blp in december  merck kgaa announced that the phase start trial of l blp did not meet its primary endpoint of an improvement in overall survival in patients with unresectable  locally advanced stage iiia or stage iiib nsclc 
merck kgaa also announced  however  that notable treatment effects were seen for l blp in certain subgroups 
merck kgaa has stated that they are consulting with external experts and regulatory authorities to determine potential next steps  if any  for l blp the ongoing clinical program of l blp that includes studies in the asia pacific region is continuing pending discussion with relevant regulatory agencies 
we have also initiated a phase trial for ont  a cancer vaccine directed against a target similar to l blp  which is proprietary to us 
in addition to our vaccine product candidates  we have developed novel vaccine technology we may further develop ourselves and or license to others  including the novel vaccine adjuvant pet lipid a 
we are also developing novel targeted small molecules for treatment of cancer 
our most advanced targeted small molecule is px  for which we are currently conducting four phase trials in a variety of cancer indications with results expected in px is an irreversible  pan isoform phosphatidylinositol kinase  or pi kinase inhibitor we obtained when we acquired prolx pharmaceuticals corporation in we are also developing ont  a preclinical pan inhibitor of the b cell lymphoma  or bcl  family of anti apoptotic proteins 
overexpression of one or more of the bcl family of proteins is common in most human cancers 
we obtained rights to ont as part of an exclusive  
table of contents worldwide license agreement with sanford burnham medical research institute or sbmri 
as of the date of this report  we have not licensed any rights to our small molecules to any third party and retain all development  commercialization and manufacturing rights 
we believe the quality and breadth of our product candidate pipeline  strategic collaborations and scientific team will potentially enable us to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of novel  commercialized therapeutics for major diseases 
we were incorporated in in canada under the name biomira inc  or biomira 
on december   oncothyreon became the successor corporation to biomira by way of a plan of arrangement effected pursuant to canadian law 
the plan of arrangement represents a transaction among entities under common control 
the assets and liabilities of the predecessor biomira have been reflected at their historical cost in the accounts of oncothyreon

our strategy our pipeline of product candidates is comprised of cancer vaccines and small molecules 
our cancer vaccines attack cancer cells by stimulating the immune system  while our small molecule product candidates inhibit critical cancer related pathways 
the resulting product pipeline provides us with opportunities to diversify risk  develop new therapies and establish strategic partnerships 
this pipeline is the foundation on which we intend to build a valuable oncology franchise and become a leading developer of vaccine and small molecule therapies for cancer 
key elements of our strategy are to advance our product pipeline 
our primary focus is advancing our pipeline of product candidates l blp  px and ont  which are in clinical trials  and ont  which is in pre clinical development  on our own or with partners 
to that end  we maintain and are building internal expertise in our development  regulatory and clinical groups 
we also have relationships with key scientific advisors  research organizations and contract manufacturers to supplement our internal efforts 
establish and maintain strategic collaborations to advance our product pipeline 
our strategy is to enter into collaborations or license arrangements at appropriate stages in our research and development process to accelerate the commercialization of our product candidates 
collaborations can supplement our own internal expertise in areas such as clinical trials and manufacturing  as well as provide us with access to our collaborators 
table of contents and or licensees marketing  sales and distribution capabilities 
for example  in we initiated a collaboration with merck kgaa to pursue joint global product research  clinical development and commercialization of l blp that collaboration evolved over time and in december  the collaboration arrangement with merck kgaa was replaced with a license agreement  pursuant to which merck kgaa has sole responsibility for the clinical development  manufacture and commercialization of l blp all development costs for l blp have been borne exclusively by merck kgaa since march   with the exception of manufacturing process development costs  which merck kgaa also assumed beginning on december  we have no further performance obligations under our arrangement with merck kgaa and will potentially receive cash payments upon the occurrence of certain events and royalties based on net sales 
the opportunity to realize such payments is dependent upon merck kgaa s decisions regarding potential next steps with l blp selectively license our technologies 
as a result of our experience in cancer vaccine development  we have acquired and developed unique technologies that are available for license 
for example  we have developed a fully synthetic toll like receptor agonist called pet lipid a  which we believe to be useful as a vaccine adjuvant 
acquire or in license attractive product candidates and technologies 
in addition to our internal research and development initiatives  we have ongoing efforts to identify products and technologies to acquire or in license from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions 
for example  we acquired prolx in and we in licensed ont from the sbmri in we plan to continue supplementing our internal development programs through strategic acquisition or in licensing transactions 
product candidates overview product candidate technology most advanced indication development stage l blp vaccine non small cell lung cancer phase px small molecule to be determined phase ont vaccine to be determined phase ont small molecule to be determined preclinical in the table above  under the heading development stage  phase indicates evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety within an expanded patient population  at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites  phase indicates clinical safety testing  dosage testing and initial efficacy testing in a limited patient population  phase indicates initial clinical testing of safety  dosage tolerance  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and preclinical indicates the program has not yet entered human clinical trials 
vaccine products general the immunotherapeutic or cancer vaccine approach is based on the concept that tumors possess distinct antigens  like the mucin  or muc  antigen incorporated in our l blp and ont vaccines  which should be recognized by the body s immune system 
immunotherapy is designed to stimulate an individual s immune system to recognize cancer cells and control the growth and spread of cancers in order to increase the survival of cancer patients 
l blp formerly known as stimuvax our lead product candidate currently under clinical development is a vaccine we call l blp l blp incorporates a amino acid sequence of the cancer antigen muc  in a liposomal formulation 
l blp is designed to induce an immune response to destroy cancer cells that express muc  a protein antigen widely expressed on many common 
table of contents cancers  such as lung cancer  breast cancer and colorectal cancer 
l blp is thought to work by stimulating the body s immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells expressing muc l blp is being evaluated for the treatment of nsclc 
lung cancer 
lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women 
more people die of lung cancer than of colon  breast and prostate cancers combined 
according to a report of the world health organization  lung cancer both non small cell and small cell type affects more than million patients a year  with around million deaths annually and around  in the united states  europe and japan 
about of all lung cancers are of the non small cell type 
further  only about of people diagnosed with nsclc survive this disease after five years 
for most patients with nsclc  current treatments provide limited success 
according to a global data report  the nsclc market was estimated to exceed billion 
there are currently no therapeutic vaccines approved for the treatment of nsclc 
we believe therapeutic vaccines have the potential to substantially enlarge the nsclc market  both because of their novel mechanism of action and their expected safety profile 
l blp is currently being developed as maintenance therapy following treatment of inoperable locoregional stage iii nsclc with induction chemotherapy 
stage i iiia nsclc patients are generally treated with surgery and radiation  while stage iiib iv patients are inoperable and generally treated with chemotherapy  radiation and palliative care 
the market is currently driven by the use of several drug classes  namely chemotherapeutic agents taxanes and cytotoxics and targeted therapies iressa  nexavar  sutent  tarceva and avastin 
there are currently two products approved as maintenance therapy following treatment of inoperable locoregional stage iii nsclc with induction chemotherapy  tarceva erlotinib  a targeted small molecule from genentech  inc  a member of the roche group  and alimta pemetrexed  a chemotherapeutic from eli lilly and company 
l blp has not been tested in combination with or in comparison to these products 
it is possible that other existing or new agents will be approved for this indication 
clinical results and status 
in december  merck kgaa announced that the phase start trial of l blp did not meet its primary endpoint of an improvement in overall survival in patients with unresectable  locally advanced stage iiia or stage iiib nsclc 
start was a randomized  multicenter  double blind  placebo controlled trial initiated in january that assessed the efficacy  safety and tolerability of l blp in patients with unresectable stage iii nsclc who achieved a response or stable disease after chemoradiotherapy 
patients were randomized to receive either a single low dose of cyclophosphamide followed by l blp weekly injections for eight weeks followed by injections every six weeks until progression plus best supportive care  or bsc or placebo plus bsc 
more than  patients from countries were recruited into the start trial 
despite not meeting the primary endpoint  merck kgaa has indicated that notable treatment effects were seen for l blp in certain subgroups 
we believe that merck kgaa is conducting further analyses of the data from the start trial to explore the potential benefit risk profile of l blp in certain populations 
in addition  we believe that merck kgaa is consulting with external scientific advisors and regulatory authorities about potential next steps for the development of l blp patient safety in the start trial was monitored frequently by an independent data monitoring committee and no new or unexpected safety concerns were noted for the study 
in prior clinical studies  the most frequently reported adverse events included injection site reactions  flu like symptoms  nausea  cough  fatigue and dyspnea 
merck kgaa has indicated that other ongoing studies of l blp will continue pending discussions with the relevant regulatory authorities 
these studies include an additional phase trial of l blp in nsclc being conducted in asia  referred to as the inspire 
table of contents study 
the inspire study is a phase iii  multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled clinical trial initiated in december designed to evaluate the efficacy  safety and tolerability of l blp in patients of asian heritage suffering from unresectable  stage iiia or iiib nsclc who have had a response or stable disease after at least two cycles of platinum based chemoradiotherapy 
the design of the inspire study is almost identical to the start study 
inspire will enroll approximately unresectable  stage iii nsclc patients across china  hong kong  korea  singapore and taiwan 
merck kgaa is also conducting a phase trial of l blp in patients with nsclc in japan 
on march   we announced that merck suspended the clinical development program for l blp as the result of a suspected unexpected serious adverse event reaction in a patient with multiple myeloma participating in an exploratory clinical trial 
the exploratory trial was designed to investigate the mechanism of action of l blp and the effect of cyclophosphamide on regulatory t cells which may affect the response to the therapeutic vaccine 
the adverse event occurred in a patient receiving a more intensive cyclophosphamide regimen than is utilized in the phase clinical program for l blp the patient developed an encephalitis  or inflammation of the brain  of unknown cause  and subsequently died of such condition 
this suspension was a precautionary measure while investigation of the cause of this adverse event was conducted 
in june  the fda lifted the clinical hold on the nsclc trials 
the suspension affected the phase clinical program for l blp in nsclc 
for example  patients enrolled in the start trial were unable to receive l blp during the duration of the suspension 
ont liposome vaccine product candidate we have developed a completely synthetic muc based liposomal glycolipopeptide cancer vaccine  ont  for potential use in several cancer indications  including breast  thyroid  colon  stomach  pancreas  ovarian and prostate  as well as certain types of lung cancer 
the ont glycolipopeptide combines carbohydrate and peptide determinates in a multi epitopic vaccine that evokes both cellular and humoral immune responses against major cancer associated epitopes expressed on adenocarcinomas 
ont is our first completely synthetic vaccine candidate 
ont includes our proprietary liposomal delivery technology 
we initiated a phase clinical trial of ont in march the phase trial of ont consists of two parts 
part will study a dose escalation schedule in up to patients to determine the maximally tolerated and or recommended dose of ont administered either once every other week or once every week over an week period 
part will further investigate the safety of ont at the maximally tolerated or recommended dose in up to additional patients at the weekly and or biweekly schedule 
the ability of ont to induce both a humoral and a cellular immune response will be investigated in both parts of the study 
we currently expect to complete part of the phase trial of ont in because both ont and l blp are targeted at the muc antigen  we currently expect that the further development of ont will depend  in part  on the results of further analysis of results from the start trial 
we currently own all rights to ont as discussed in the section captioned  our strategic collaboration with merck kgaa  if we intend to license the development or marketing rights to ont  merck kgaa will have a right of first negotiation with respect to such license rights 
pet lipid a vaccine adjuvant product candidate we have developed a proprietary synthetic lipid a analog  pet lipid a  a toll like receptor tlr agonist 
pet lipid a has been produced under current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  conditions as an adjuvant for vaccine formulations for clinical trials and is a component of our vaccine candidate  ont we also have other effective lipid a 
table of contents analogs available for our own use and for evaluation by our licensing partners 
our synthetic lipid analogs provide strong innate immune stimulation 
these synthetic structures are easy to formulate and manufacture 
we are seeking new collaborations to discover novel applications of these molecules as stand alone therapeutics and as synergistic adjuvants for antibiotic and antiviral vaccines 
small molecule drugs general on october   we acquired prolx pharmaceuticals corporation  or prolx  of tucson  arizona  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel targeted small molecules for the treatment of cancer 
we are currently developing px  which we obtained as a part of the prolx acquisition 
we continue to evaluate new opportunities to acquire or in license additional small molecule compounds designed to inhibit the activity of specific cancer related proteins 
we believe this approach gives us multiple opportunities for successful clinical development while diversifying risk 
px px is an inhibitor of the pi kinase pten akt pathway  an important survival signaling pathway that is activated in many types of human cancer 
pi kinase is over expressed in a number of human cancers  especially ovarian  colon  head and neck  urinary tract and cervical cancers  where it leads to increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis  or programmed cell death 
the pi kinase inhibitor px induces prolonged inhibition of tumor pi kinase signaling following both oral and intravenous administration and has been shown to have good in vivo anti tumor activity in human ovarian and lung cancer  as well as intracranial glioblastoma  tumor models 
px may potentiate the anti tumor activity of other cancer therapeutics and radiation 
we have completed a phase trial of px in patients with advanced metastatic cancer which evaluated both an intermittent and a continuous dosing schedule of px based on the results in this open label trial  we initiated two phase trials of px in combination with other agents in we have completed the phase portions of both trials  and we initiated the randomized phase portions in the first trial is examining px in combination with docetaxel taxotere versus docetaxel alone in patients with either nsclc or locally advanced  recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck scchn 
the nsclc arm of this trial has completed enrollment  with data currently expected in the first half of the scchn arm is currently expected to complete enrollment in the first half of  with data currently expected late in the second trial is randomizing patients to cetuximab erbitux with or without px and will include patients with either scchn or colorectal cancer 
the scchn arm of this trial is currently expected to complete enrollment in the first half of  with data currently expected late in the colorectal arm of this trial has completed enrollment  with data currently expected in mid we also initiated two phase trials of px as a single agent in  one in patients with glioblastoma and the other in patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer 
these single agent trials are being conducted by the national cancer institute of canada clinical trials group 
data from both phase single arm trials is currently expected in mid we also initiated a phase trial of px in combination with vemurafinib zelboraf in vemurafenib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the braf ve mutation 

table of contents market opportunity for targeted small molecules the market for targeted cancer drugs  both small molecules and biologic agents  is expanding rapidly  with the approval of such agents as gleevec  herceptin  tarceva  nexavar  sutent and avastin 
for example  roche group reported aggregate world wide sales for herceptin  tarceva and avastin of billion in our small molecule compounds are highly targeted agents directed at proteins found in many types of cancer cells 
therefore  we believe that these product candidates could potentially be useful for many different oncology indications that address large markets 
our strategic collaboration with merck kgaa in may  we and merck kgaa entered into a collaborative arrangement to pursue joint global product research  clinical development and commercialization for our then two most advanced product candidates  l blp vaccine and theratope vaccine 
the collaboration covered the entire field of oncology for these two product candidates and was documented in collaboration and supply agreements  which we refer to as the agreements 
in addition to granting the license with respect to certain rights to develop and commercialize the product candidates  the parties agreed to collaborate in substantially all aspects of clinical development and commercialization and we agreed to manufacture the clinical and commercial supply of the product candidates 
in  following the failure of theratope in a phase clinical trial  merck kgaa returned all rights to theratope to us 
development of theratope was subsequently discontinued and we do not currently plan further clinical development 
following the discontinuation of theratope development efforts  we continued to collaborate with merck kgaa with respect to the development of l blp  pursuant to the terms of the agreements 
in january  we and merck kgaa entered into a binding letter of intent  pursuant to which the agreements were amended and we and merck kgaa agreed to negotiate in good faith to amend and restate the agreements 
pursuant to the letter of intent  in addition to the rights granted to merck kgaa under the agreements  we granted to merck kgaa additional rights with respect to the clinical development and commercialization of l blp in the united states and  subject to certain conditions  the right to act as a secondary manufacturer of l blp in august  we amended and restated the collaboration and supply agreements with merck kgaa  which restructured the agreements and formalized the terms of the letter of intent 
pursuant to the agreements  merck kgaa assumed world wide responsibility for the clinical development and commercialization of l blp  while we retained responsibility for manufacturing process development and manufacturing the clinical and commercial supply of l blp in december  we entered into a license agreement which replaced the agreements 
under the license agreement  we licensed to merck kgaa the exclusive right to manufacture l blp in addition to the previously licensed rights and the right to sublicense to other persons all rights licensed to merck kgaa by us  we transferred certain manufacturing know how  we agreed not to develop any product  other than ont  that is competitive with l blp and if we intend to license the development or commercialization rights to ont  merck kgaa will have a right of first negotiation with respect to such rights 
upon the execution of the license agreement and asset purchase agreement described below  all of our future performance obligations related to the collaboration for the clinical development and development of the manufacturing process for l blp were 
table of contents removed and continuing involvement by us in the development and manufacturing of l blp ceased although we continue to be entitled to certain information rights with respect to clinical testing  development and manufacture of l blp 
in return for the license of manufacturing rights and transfer of manufacturing know how under the license agreement  we received an up front cash payment of approximately million 
in addition  under the license agreement we may receive additional future cash payments of up to million which figure excludes the final million manufacturing process transfer payment received on december   pursuant to the terms of the license agreement and million received prior to the execution of the license agreement pursuant to the terms of the predecessor agreements  for biologics license application  or bla  submission for first and second cancer indications  for regulatory approval for first and second cancer indications  and for sales milestones 
we understand merck kgaa plans to investigate the use of l blp in multiple types of cancer 
we will receive a royalty based on certain net sales thresholds  ranging from a percentage in the mid teens to the high single digits  depending on the territory in which the net sales occur 
the royalty rate is higher in north america than in the rest of the world in return for our relinquishing our prior co promotion interest in us and canadian sales 
in connection with the entry into the license agreement  we also entered into an asset purchase agreement  pursuant to which we sold to merck kgaa certain assets related to the manufacture of  and inventory of  l blp  placebo and raw materials  and merck kgaa agreed to assume certain liabilities related to the manufacture of l blp and our obligations related to the lease of our edmonton  alberta  canada facility 
the aggregate purchase price paid by merck kgaa pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement consisted of approximately million  for aggregate consideration payable to us in connection with the license agreement and the asset purchase agreement of approximately million 
license agreements we have in licensed targets and intellectual property from academic institutions for use in our pipeline programs  including the following cancer research technology limited 
in  we acquired from cancer research technology limited  or crtl  of london  england an exclusive world wide license of crtl s rights to the mucin peptide antigen  or muc  found on human breast  ovarian  colon and pancreatic cancer and other types of solid tumor cells for uses in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer 
muc is incorporated in our l blp and ont vaccines 
this license agreement was amended and restated in november under the terms of the amended and restated agreement  we are required to pay royalties on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from crtl 
based on these issued patents  we would be required to pay a royalty on us sales of l blp in the mid single digits until expiry of these patents in the united states  which is currently anticipated to be we are also required to pay certain royalties on sublicense revenue received by us ranging from a percentage in the mid to high single digits 
these sublicense royalties will be credited against minimum sublicense royalty payments of million made by us in to date  we have utilized approximately million of these credits 
university of alberta 
in  we entered into an exclusive license with the university of alberta for certain patents relating to uses of liposomal cancer vaccines of muc  and an adjuvant  lipid a  for vaccine formulations which we use in l blp under the terms of this agreement  we have made payments of cdn million  and are required to make progress dependent milestone payments of up to cdn million and to pay royalties at a fraction of a percent on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from the university of alberta 
based on these issued patents  this royalty would be due on sales of l blp in the us until as late as january  
table of contents university of arizona 
we have an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to px from the university of arizona 
if px is commercialized  we will owe the university of arizona certain progress dependent milestone payments up to a maximum of  we will also owe the university of arizona low single digit royalties on net sales of products sold by us or sublicensees that are covered by the license agreements 
in addition  if we grant a third party a sublicense to patents we have licensed from the university of arizona  after we recoup any research costs relating to the applicable product that we incurred prior to granting the sublicense  we will owe to the university of arizona a sub teen double digit percentage of any sublicensing income we receive from a third party sublicensee with regard to such product 
sanford burnham medical research institute 
in september  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with sbmri for certain intellectual property related to sbmri s small molecule program based on ont and related compounds 
ont is a pan inhibitor of the bcl family of anti apoptotic proteins and is currently in pre clinical development 
under the terms of this agreement  we made a payment of million to sbmri  which was recorded as part of research and development expense 
in addition  we may be required to make milestone payments of up to approximately million upon the occurrence of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones and up to million based on certain net sales targets 
we would be required to pay a royalty in the low to mid single digits on net sales of licensed products 
in addition  if we generate income other than royalties on sales of licensed products from a sublicense of any of the licensed rights  we must pay sbmri a portion of certain income received from the sublicensee at a rate between mid single digits and  depending on stage of the clinical development of the rights when the sublicense is granted 
unless earlier terminated in accordance with the license agreement  the agreement shall terminate on a country by country basis upon the later of years after the first commercial sale of the first licensed product and the expiration of the last to expire patent within the licensed patents 
patents and proprietary information we seek appropriate patent protection for our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the united states and other countries 
as of december   we owned approximately us patents and patent applications  as well as the corresponding foreign patents and patent applications and held exclusive or partially exclusive licenses to us patents and patent applications  as well as the corresponding foreign patents and patent applications 
our patents and patent applications are directed to our product candidates as well as to our liposomal formulation technology 
although we believe our patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage  the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we and our corporate collaborators may not be able to develop patentable products or processes or obtain patents from pending patent applications 
even if patent claims are allowed  the claims may not issue  or in the event of issuance  may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us or our corporate collaborators 
our clinical product candidates are protected by composition and use patents and patent applications 
patent protection afforded by the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates will expire over the following time frames product candidate expiration of us patent protection l blp patent patent application px patent patent application ont patent patent  application ont patent patent  application 
table of contents in addition  our composition of matter patents for l blp and px will expire in and  respectively  and our composition of matter patents  for ont and ont will expire in and  respectively 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained 
our policy is to require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us 
these agreements provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us 
manufacturing we currently outsource the manufacturing of drug substances and drug products for all of our products in clinical development 
this arrangement allows us to use contract manufacturers that already have extensive cgmp manufacturing experience 
we have a staff with experience in the management of contract manufacturing and the development of efficient commercial manufacturing processes for our products 
we currently intend to outsource the supply of all our commercial products 
as discussed above under the caption  our strategic collaboration with merck kgaa  in december  we entered into a license agreement with merck kgaa pursuant to which we licensed to merck kgaa the exclusive right to manufacture l blp prior to the entry into the license agreement  we were responsible for the manufacture of l blp and merck kgaa purchased l blp and placebo from us for use in clinical trials in accordance with our arrangement with them 
concurrently with the entry into the license agreement  we also entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold to merck kgaa our remaining inventory of both l blp and placebo 
the manufacture of l blp is outsourced pursuant to agreements with baxter international inc  or baxter for the manufacture of l blp and corixa corporation  or corixa  a subsidiary of glaxosmithkline plc  or glaxosmithkline  for the manufacture of the adjuvant used in l blp 
these agreements were assigned to merck kgaa in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement 
the corixa agreement includes royalty payments payable to corixa  which merck kgaa is responsible for paying 
if l blp is not approved by  corixa may terminate its obligation to supply the adjuvant 
although in such a case we would retain the necessary licenses from corixa required to have the adjuvant manufactured  the transfer of the process to a third party would delay the development and commercialization of l blp in addition  prior to the entry into the license agreement and asset purchase agreement  we performed process development  assay development  quality control and scale up activities for l blp at our edmonton facility  this facility and those activities were also transferred to merck kgaa 
for our small molecule programs  we rely on third parties to manufacture both the active pharmaceutical ingredients  or api  and drug product 
we believe there are several contract manufacturers capable of manufacturing both the api and drug product for these compounds  however  establishing a relationship with an alternative supplier would likely delay our ability to produce material 
we believe that our existing supplies of drug product and our contract manufacturing relationships with our existing and other potential contract manufacturers with whom we are in discussions  will be sufficient to accommodate our planned clinical trials 
however  we may need to obtain additional manufacturing arrangements  if available on commercially reasonable terms  or increase our own manufacturing capability to meet our future needs  both of which would require significant capital investment 
we may also enter 
table of contents into collaborations with pharmaceutical or larger biotechnology companies to enhance the manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates 
competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive  and any product candidate developed by us would compete with existing drugs and therapies 
there are many pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  public and private universities  government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to cancer therapy 
many of these organizations have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have 
our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to design and develop products that are superior to other products in the market and under development  attract and retain qualified scientific  product development and commercial personnel  obtain patent and or other proprietary protection for our product candidates and technologies  obtain required regulatory approvals  successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the design  development and commercialization of new products  compete on  among other things  product efficacy and safety  time to market  price  extent of adverse side effects and the basis of and convenience of treatment procedures  and identify  secure the rights to and develop products and exploit these products commercially before others are able to develop competitive products 
in addition  our ability to compete may be affected if insurers and other third party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products  making branded products less attractive to buyers from a cost perspective 
l blp there are currently two products approved as maintenance therapy following treatment of inoperable locoregional stage iii nsclc with induction chemotherapy  tarceva erlotinib  a targeted small molecule from genentech  inc  a member of the roche group  and alimta pemetrexed  a chemotherapeutic from eli lilly and company 
l blp has not been tested in combination with or in comparison to these products 
it is possible that other existing or new agents will be approved for this indication 
in addition  there are at least three vaccines in development for the treatment of nsclc  including gsk s mage a vaccine in phase  novarx corporation s lucanix in phase and transgene s tg in phase tg also targets muc  although using technology different from l blp to our knowledge  these vaccines are not currently being developed in the same indications as l blp however  subsequent development of these vaccines  including l blp  may result in direct competition 
small molecule products 
we have two small molecule programs in development  px and ont px is an inhibitor of pi kinase 
we are aware of numerous companies that have entered clinical trials with competing compounds targeting the same protein  many of which have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and drug development resources than we do 
among these competitors are novartis phase  roche genentech phase  bayer phase  sanofi aventis phase  chugai phase and glaxosmithkline phase 
there are also several approved targeted therapies for cancer and in development against which px might compete 
ont is a small 
table of contents molecule inhibitor of the bcl anti apoptotic protein family 
we are aware of at least one company that is developing a competing drug that targets the same family  ascenta phase 
there are also several approved targeted therapies for cancer and in development against which our small molecule product candidates might compete 
government regulation government authorities in the united states  at the federal  state and local level  and other countries extensively regulate  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution  marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing 
us government regulation in the united states  the information that must be submitted to the fda in order to obtain approval to market a new drug varies depending on whether the drug is a new product whose safety and effectiveness has not previously been demonstrated in humans or a drug whose active ingredient s and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug 
a new drug will follow the new drug application  or nda  route for approval  a new biologic will follow the biologics license application  or bla  route for approval  and a drug that claims to be the same as an already approved drug may be able to follow the abbreviated new drug application  or anda  route for approval 
nda and bla approval process in the united states  the fda regulates drugs and biologics under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and  in the case of biologics  also under the public health service act  and implementing regulations 
if we fail to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process  approval process or after approval  we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions 
these sanctions could include the fda s refusal to approve pending applications  license suspension or revocation  withdrawal of an approval  a clinical hold  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  injunctions  fines  civil penalties or criminal prosecution 
any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 
the steps required before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the united states include completion of pre clinical laboratory tests  animal studies and formulation studies under the fda s good laboratory practices regulations  submission to the fda of an ind for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication  submission to the fda of an nda or bla  satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cgmp  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
an ind sponsor must submit the results of the pre clinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  to the fda as part of the ind 
the ind must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
an ind will automatically become effective days after receipt by the fda  unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the ind 
in that case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any 
table of contents outstanding fda concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed 
submission of an ind may not result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators 
clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing  among other things  the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated 
each clinical protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap or be combined 
each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board at each site where the trial will be conducted before it can begin at that site 
phase clinical trials usually involve the initial introduction of the investigational drug into humans to evaluate the product s safety  dosage tolerance  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and  if possible  to gain an early indication of its effectiveness 
phase clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage  identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications 
phase clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded patient population 
phase  phase and phase testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period  if at all 
the fda or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing  the results of the pre clinical studies and of the clinical studies  together with other detailed information  including information on the chemistry  manufacture and control criteria of the product  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications 
the fda reviews an nda to determine  among other things  whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use 
the fda reviews a bla to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe  pure and potent and whether the facility in which it is manufactured  processed  packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product s continued safety  purity and potency 
in connection with the submission of an nda or bla  an applicant may seek a special protocol assessment  or spa  which is an agreement between an applicant and the fda on the design and size of clinical trials that is intended to form the basis of an nda or bla 
before approving an application  the fda will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured 
the fda will not approve the product unless cgmp compliance is satisfactory 
if the fda determines the application  manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable  it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information 
notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information  the fda ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and each may take several years to complete 
the fda may not grant approval on a timely basis  or at all 
we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals  which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates 
the fda may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of our product candidates 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 

table of contents fast track designation priority review a fast track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition 
under the fast track program  the sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request that the fda designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the development of the product  prior to marketing 
the fda can base approval of a marketing application for a fast track product on an effect on a surrogate endpoint  or on another endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 
the fda may condition approval of an application for a fast track product on a commitment to do post approval studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint and require prior review of all promotional materials 
in addition  the fda may withdraw approval of a fast track product in an expedited manner on a number of grounds  including the sponsor s failure to conduct any required post approval study in a timely manner 
the fda also has established priority and standard review classifications for original ndas and efficacy supplements 
priority review applies to the time frame for fda review of completed marketing applications and is separate from and independent of the fast track and accelerated approval mechanisms 
the classification system  which does not preclude the fda from doing work on other projects  provides a way of prioritizing ndas upon receipt and throughout the application review process 
priority designation applies to new drugs that have the potential for providing significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment or prevention of a disease 
hence  even if an nda is initially classified as a priority application  this status can change during the fda review process  such as in the situation where another product is approved for the same disease for which previously there was no available therapy 
in addition  priority review does not guarantee that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval 
to date  none of our product candidates have obtained priority designation from the fda 
post approval requirements after regulatory approval of a product is obtained  we are required to comply with a number of post approval requirements 
holders of an approved nda or bla are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the fda  to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products 
also  quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval 
the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp  which imposes certain procedural  substantive and recordkeeping requirements 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cgmp and other aspects of regulatory compliance 
we use  and in at least the near term will continue to use  third party manufacturers to produce our product candidates in clinical and commercial quantities 
future fda inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
in addition  discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product  manufacturer or holder of an approved nda or bla  including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary  fda initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing 
also  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development 

table of contents in addition  as a condition of approval of an nda or bla  the fda may require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product s safety or efficacy 
canadian and foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product candidate  we must obtain approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product candidate in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
under the canadian regulatory system  health canada is the regulatory body that governs the sale of drugs for the purposes of use in clinical trials 
accordingly  any company that wishes to conduct a clinical trial in canada must submit a clinical trial application to health canada 
health canada reviews the application and notifies the company within days if the application is found to be deficient 
if the application is deemed acceptable  health canada will issue a letter to the company within the day review period which means the company may proceed with its clinical trial s 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization from one member state may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
reimbursement sales of biopharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third party reimbursement  including medicare 
each third party payor may have its own policy regarding what products it will cover  the conditions under which it will cover such products  and how much it will pay for such products 
it is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third party payors 
reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis 
in addition  in some foreign countries  the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed 
the requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country 
for example  the european union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use 
a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the united states to fundamental changes 
there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business  including the affordable care act of we anticipate that the us congress  state legislatures and the private sector will continue to 
table of contents consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs 
these cost containment measures include controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs  controls on healthcare providers  challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means  reform of drug importation laws  and expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person 
we are unable to predict what legislation  regulations or policies  if any  relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what the magnitude of the effect such legislation  regulations or policies would have on our business 
any cost containment measures  including those listed above  or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability 
research and development we devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new product candidates 
during the years ended december   and  we expended approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
employees as of december   we including our consolidated subsidiaries had employees  of whom are engaged in development activities  in finance and administration  and of whom hold phd and or phd degrees 
a number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with other pharmaceutical or medical products companies 
our ability to develop marketable products and to establish and maintain our competitive position in light of technological developments will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we have also chosen to outsource activities where skills are in short supply or where it is economically prudent to do so 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
financial information we manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reporting segment 
financial information regarding our operations  assets and liabilities  including our total revenue and net loss for the years ended december   and and our total assets as of december  and  is included in our audited financial statements located elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report  and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to our business we cannot be certain that our lead product candidate l blp formerly known as stimuvax will be successfully developed or receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized 
our lead cancer vaccine product candidate  l blp  is being evaluated for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
under our license agreement with merck kgaa for l blp  merck kgaa is entirely responsible for the development  manufacture and worldwide commercialization of l blp in december  merck kgaa announced that the phase start trial of l blp did not meet its primary endpoint of an improvement in overall survival in patients with unresectable  locally advanced stage iiia or stage iiib nsclc 
merck kgaa announced  however  that notable treatment effects were seen for l blp in certain subgroups and has stated that they are consulting with external experts and regulatory authorities to determine potential next steps  if any  for l blp before submitting a biologic license application or its foreign equivalent for approval  we expect that merck kgaa must successfully complete one or more clinical trials in nsclc potentially in a subgroup or additional subgroups identified in the start trial 
this process can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
pursuant to our agreement with merck kgaa  merck kgaa is responsible for the development and the regulatory approval process and any subsequent commercialization of l blp we cannot assure you that merck kgaa will identify subgroups in which to conduct additional clinical trials of l blp or continue to advance the development and commercialization of l blp in the event ongoing clinical trials proceed or additional clinical trials are pursued and these clinical trials fail to demonstrate that l blp is safe and effective  it will not receive regulatory approval 
even if l blp receives regulatory approval  it may never be successfully commercialized 
if l blp does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized  or if merck kgaa decides not to continue to advance the development and commercialization of l blp  we may not be able to generate revenue  become profitable or continue our operations which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition and could result in a substantial decline in the price of our common stock 
the results of further analysis of results from the start trial for l blp will influence our decisions regarding further development of our product candidate ont we have initiated a phase trial for ont  a cancer vaccine directed against a target similar to l blp  which is proprietary to us 
the phase trial of ont consists of two parts 
part will study a dose escalation schedule in up to patients to determine the maximally tolerated or recommended dose of ont administered either once every other week or once every week over an week period 
part will further investigate the safety of ont at the maximally tolerated or recommended dose in up to additional patients at the weekly or biweekly schedule 
we currently expect to complete part of the phase trial on ont in 
table of contents because both ont and l blp are targeted at the muc antigen  we currently expect that the further development of ont will depend  in part  on the results of further analysis of results from the start trial 
in the event that the results of this analysis indicate that further development of ont is unlikely to result in a safe and effective vaccine in its targeted indications or that further development is unwarranted for other reasons  then we may choose to discontinue further development of ont or otherwise modify our development efforts related to ont any announcement regarding the abandonment of or changes in our current plans for the development of ont would reduce the number of our clinical product candidates and could adversely impact the trading price of our common stock or our ability to obtain further funding for our remaining pre clinical and clinical pipeline of drug candidates 
the suspension or termination of merck s clinical development program for l blp could severely harm our business 
pursuant to our agreement  merck kgaa has the exclusive right to develop  manufacture and commercialize l blp in return for our right to receive cash payments upon the occurrence of certain events and royalties based on net sales 
merck kgaa has the right to terminate the license agreement upon days prior written notice if  in its reasonable judgment  it determines there are issues concerning the safety or efficacy of l blp that would materially and adversely affect l blp s medical  economic or competitive viability 
we believe that merck kgaa is consulting with external scientific advisors and regulatory authorities about potential next steps for the development of l blp  if any  and merck kgaa may ultimately decide not to continue development of l blp and may terminate the license agreement 
additionally  in march  merck kgaa temporarily suspended the clinical development program for l blp as the result of a suspected unexpected serious adverse event reaction in a patient participating in an exploratory clinical trial 
if other safety concerns arise in current or future clinical trials involving l blp  merck kgaa may decide to suspend the clinical trials or terminate the license agreement 
any future payments under the license agreement  including royalties to us  will depend on the extent to which merck kgaa advances l blp through development and commercialization 
the opportunity for us to realize these payments is dependent upon merck kgaa s decisions regarding potential next steps with l blp if merck kgaa terminates the agreement for safety or efficacy reasons  or breaches the agreement  the further development and commercialization of l blp would be severely impaired 
if we determined that we desired to continue the development  manufacturing and or commercialization of l blp subsequent to any such termination  we would be unable to use any data generated during merck kgaa s development of the product unless we were able to negotiate terms with merck kgaa for the use of such data 
we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to reach an agreement with merck kgaa on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we were unable to use those data  the development  manufacturing and commercialization of l blp would be more costly and could be delayed or terminated 
even if we were able to acquire the rights to use the merck kgaa data related to l blp  we would need to obtain the capital necessary to fund the further development and commercialization of l blp or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party related to such development and commercialization 
we could also become involved in disputes with merck kgaa  which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization of l blp and time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration 
if merck kgaa terminates or breaches its agreement with us  or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner  the likelihood of successfully developing or commercializing l blp would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents products that appear promising in research and development may be delayed or may fail to reach later stages of clinical development 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
products that appear promising in research and development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development 
for example  our product candidate l blp did not meet its primary endpoint in a phase clinical trial 
additionally  the phase clinical trials currently being run for px and for which we expect results in  may fail to demonstrate that px is sufficiently safe and effective to warrant further development 
furthermore  decisions regarding the further development of product candidates  such as phase product candidates with product profiles similar to px  must be made with limited and incomplete data  which makes it difficult to ensure or even accurately predict whether the allocation of limited resources and the expenditure of additional capital on specific product candidates will result in desired outcomes 
preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  and negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could delay  limit or prevent the development of a product candidate  which could harm our business  financial condition and results or the trading price of our securities 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates  including l blp or px l blp and ont are based on novel technologies  which may raise new regulatory issues that could delay or make fda or foreign regulatory approval more difficult 
the process of obtaining required fda and other regulatory approvals  including foreign approvals  is expensive  often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
l blp and ont are novel  therefore  regulatory agencies may lack experience with them  which may lengthen the regulatory review process  increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of l blp and our other active vaccine products under development 
to date  the fda has approved for commercial sale in the united states only one active vaccine designed to stimulate an immune response against cancer 
consequently  there is limited precedent for the successful development or commercialization of products based on our technologies in this area 
this may lengthen the regulatory review process  increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our products under development 
if we fail to acquire and develop products or product candidates at all or on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to grow our business 
the success of our product pipeline strategy depends  in part  on our ability to identify  select and acquire product candidates 
proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process 
we compete for partnering arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic research institutions 
our competitors may have stronger relationships with third parties with whom we are interested in collaborating or may have more established histories of developing and commercializing products 
as a result  our competitors may have a competitive advantage in entering into partnering arrangements with such third parties 
in addition  even if we find promising product candidates  and generate interest in a partnering or strategic arrangement to acquire such product candidates  we may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates or approved products on terms that we find acceptable  if at all 
if we fail to acquire and develop product candidates from others  we may be unable to grow our business 
we expect that any product candidate to which we acquire rights will require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive clinical evaluation and approval by the fda and non us regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are 
table of contents subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities 
even if the product candidates are approved  we can make no assurance that we would be capable of economically producing the product or that the product would be commercially successful 
we have a history of net losses  we anticipate additional losses and we may never become profitable 
other than the year ended december   we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since we commenced our research activities in the net income we realized in was due entirely to our december transactions with merck kgaa  and we do not anticipate realizing net income again for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our losses have resulted primarily from expenses incurred in research and development of our product candidates 
we may make significant capital commitments to fund the development of our product candidates 
if these development efforts are unsuccessful  the development costs would be incurred without any future revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we do not know when or if we will complete our product development efforts  receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  or successfully commercialize any approved products 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the extent of any future losses or the time required to achieve profitability  if at all 
any failure of our products to complete successful clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval and any failure to become and remain profitable would adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations 
there is no assurance that we will be granted regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
merck kgaa has been testing our lead product candidate  l blp  in clinical trials for the treatment of nsclc 
we are conducting four phase trials and one phase trial for px and a phase trial for ont our other product candidates remain in the pre clinical testing stages 
there can be no assurance that we will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals 
a number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  including our company  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
for example  in december  we and merck kgaa announced that l blp did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in overall survival in a phase trial in patients with nsclc 
further  we  any of our collaborators or merck kgaa may be unable to submit applications to regulatory agencies within the time frame we currently expect 
once submitted  applications must be approved by various regulatory agencies before we  any of our collaborators or merck kgaa can commercialize the product described in the application 
additionally  even if applications are submitted  regulatory approval may not be obtained for any of our product candidates  and regulatory agencies could require additional studies to verify safety or efficacy  which could make further development of our product candidates impracticable 
if our product candidates are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  we may not receive regulatory approval  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we and merck kgaa currently rely on third party manufacturers to supply our product candidates 
any disruption in production  inability of these third party manufacturers to produce adequate quantities to meet our needs or merck s needs or other impediments with respect to development or manufacturing could adversely affect the clinical development and commercialization of l blp  our ability to continue our research and development activities or successfully complete pre clinical studies and clinical trials  delay submissions of our regulatory applications or adversely affect our ability to commercialize our other product candidates in a timely manner  or at all 
merck kgaa currently depends on a single manufacturer  baxter international inc  or baxter  for the supply of our lead product candidate  l blp  and on corixa corp 
now a part of glaxosmithkline plc  or gsk for the manufacture of the adjuvant in l blp if l blp is not approved by  corixa gsk may terminate its obligation to supply the adjuvant 
in this case  we would retain the necessary licenses from corixa gsk required to have the adjuvant manufactured  but the transfer of the process to a third party would delay the development and commercialization of l blp  which could materially harm our business 
our product candidates have not yet been manufactured on a commercial scale 
in order to commercialize a product candidate  the third party manufacturer may need to increase its manufacturing capacity  which may require the manufacturer to fund capital improvements to support the scale up of manufacturing and related activities 
with respect to px  we may be required to provide all or a portion of these funds 
the third party manufacturer may not be able to successfully increase its manufacturing capacity for our product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval in a timely or economic manner  or at all 
if any manufacturer is unable to provide commercial quantities of a product candidate  we or merck kgaa  in the case of l blp will need to successfully transfer manufacturing technology to a new manufacturer 
engaging a new manufacturer for a particular product candidate could require us or merck kgaa  in the case of l blp to conduct comparative studies or use other means to determine equivalence between product candidates manufactured by a new manufacturer and those previously manufactured by the existing manufacturer  which could delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates 
if any of these manufacturers is unable or unwilling to increase its manufacturing capacity or if alternative arrangements are not established on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  the development and commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply 
any manufacturer of our products must comply with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  requirements enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program or by foreign regulatory agencies 
these requirements include quality control  quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these cgmp requirements and with other fda  state and foreign regulatory requirements 
we have little control over our manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
a failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties  suspension of production  suspension or delay in product approval  product seizure or recall  or withdrawal of product approval 
if the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products 

table of contents pre clinical and clinical trials are expensive and time consuming  and any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely harm our business 
we are currently conducting clinical trials for px and ont and pre clinical studies for ont each of our product candidates must undergo extensive pre clinical studies and clinical trials as a condition to regulatory approval 
pre clinical studies and clinical trials are expensive and take many years to complete 
the commencement and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed by many factors  including safety issues or side effects  delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials  poor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials  governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements  policy and guidelines  our or our collaborators ability to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial  our or our collaborators ability to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient for use in pre clinical studies and clinical trials  and varying interpretation of data by the fda and similar foreign regulatory agencies 
it is possible that none of our product candidates will complete clinical trials in any of the markets in which we or our collaborators intend to sell those product candidates 
accordingly  we or our collaborators may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary to market our product candidates 
any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates would prevent or delay their commercialization and severely harm our business and financial condition 
the failure to enroll patients for clinical trials may cause delays in developing our product candidates 
we may encounter delays if we  any collaboration partners or merck kgaa are unable to enroll enough patients to complete clinical trials 
patient enrollment depends on many factors  including  the size of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
moreover  when one product candidate is evaluated in multiple clinical trials simultaneously  patient enrollment in ongoing trials can be adversely affected by negative results from completed trials 
our product candidates are focused in oncology  which can be a difficult patient population to recruit 
if we fail to enroll patients for clinical trials  our clinical trials may be delayed or suspended  which could delay our ability to generate revenues 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform as contractually required or otherwise expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or be able to commercialize our product candidates 
we rely on third parties  such as contract research organizations  medical institutions  clinical investigators and contract laboratories  to assist in conducting our clinical trials 
we have  in the ordinary course of business  entered into agreements with these third parties 
nonetheless  we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol 
moreover  the fda and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards  commonly referred to as good clinical practices  for conducting  recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected 
our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements 
if these third parties 
table of contents do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines  if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons  our pre clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended  delayed  suspended or terminated  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
our product candidates may never achieve market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approvals 
even if we receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates  the commercial success of these product candidates will depend on  among other things  their acceptance by physicians  patients  third party payers such as health insurance companies and other members of the medical community as a therapeutic and cost effective alternative to competing products and treatments 
new patterns of care  alternative new treatments or different reimbursement and payor paradigms  possibly due to economic conditions or governmental policies  could negatively impact the commercial viability of our product candidates 
if our product candidates fail to gain market acceptance  we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business 
market acceptance of  and demand for  any product that we may develop and commercialize will depend on many factors  including our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy  the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects  availability  relative cost and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments  the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution strategy  publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments  and our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement 
if our product candidates do not become widely accepted by physicians  patients  third party payers and other members of the medical community  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
even if regulatory approval is received for our product candidates  the later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
approval of a product candidate may be conditioned upon certain limitations and restrictions as to the drug s use  or upon the conduct of further studies  and may be subject to continuous review 
after approval of a product  if any  there will be significant ongoing regulatory compliance obligations  and if we or our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements  we  any of our collaborators or merck kgaa could be subject to penalties  including warning letters  fines  product recalls  withdrawal of regulatory approval  operating restrictions  disgorgement of profits  injunctions  and criminal prosecution 

table of contents regulatory agencies may require us  any of our collaborators or merck kgaa to delay  restrict or discontinue clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
in addition  all statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future  which could affect the cost of such clinical trials 
any unanticipated delays in clinical studies could delay our ability to generate revenues and harm our financial condition and results of operations 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products internationally 
we intend to have our product candidates marketed outside the united states 
in order to market our products in the european union and many other non us jurisdictions  we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements 
to date  we have not filed for marketing approval for any of our product candidates and may not receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates in any market 
the approval procedure varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval 
the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval  and additional testing and data review may be required 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
additionally  approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other foreign countries or by the fda 
however  a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions  including approval by the fda 
the failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions could limit commercialization of our products  reduce our ability to generate profits and harm our business 
our ability to continue with our planned operations is dependent on our success at raising additional capital sufficient to meet our obligations on a timely basis 
if we fail to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be unable to complete the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates 
we have expended and continue to expend substantial funds in connection with our product development activities and clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the very limited funds generated currently from our operations will be insufficient to enable us to bring all of our products currently under development to commercialization 
accordingly  we need to raise additional funds from the sale of our securities  partnering arrangements or other financing transactions in order to finance the commercialization of our product candidates 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when and as needed or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if financing is available  it may be on terms that adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders or restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate financing is not available  we may need to continue to reduce or eliminate our expenditures for research and development  testing  production and marketing for some of our product candidates 
our actual capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including activities and arrangements related to the commercialization of our product candidates  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing of our product candidates  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  
table of contents the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights with respect to our intellectual property  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the effect of changes and developments in our existing licensing and other relationships  and the terms of any new collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish 
if we require additional financing and cannot secure sufficient financing on acceptable terms  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  any of which would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may expand our business through the acquisition of companies or businesses or in licensing product candidates that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we may in the future seek to expand our products and capabilities by acquiring one or more companies or businesses or in licensing one or more product candidates 
for example  in september we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with sanford burnham medical research institute  or sbmri  for certain intellectual property related to sbmri s small molecule program based on ont and related compounds 
acquisitions and in licenses involve numerous risks  including substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition  difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies  potential disputes regarding contingent consideration  diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies or businesses 
other than our license from sbmri  under our current management team we have not expanded our business through in licensing and we have completed only one acquisition  therefore  our experience in making acquisitions and in licensing is limited 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition or in license will result in short term or long term benefits to us 
we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or in licensed product candidate 
in addition  our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions and in licenses 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies or in licensed product candidates work or be successful 
furthermore  the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or company or in licensed product candidate may require a substantial capital investment by us 
we may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our capital stock  which could dilute our current stockholders ownership interest  or securities convertible into our capital stock  which could dilute current stockholders ownership interest upon conversion 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain and enforce our proprietary rights  we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably 
our success is dependent in part on maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights and will depend in large part on our ability to defend patents once issued  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
as of december   we owned approximately us patents and us patent applications  as well as the corresponding foreign patents and patent applications  and held exclusive or partially exclusive licenses to approximately us patents and us patent applications  as well as the corresponding foreign patents and patent applications 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
for example we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by any of our patents  if issued  or our pending patent applications  we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products and or duplicate any of our technologies and or products  it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or  if issued  these patents may not be sufficient to protect our technology or provide us with a basis for commercially viable products and may not provide us with any competitive advantages  if our pending applications issue as patents  they may be challenged by third parties as infringed  invalid or unenforceable under us or foreign laws  if issued  the patents under which we hold rights may not be valid or enforceable  or we may develop additional proprietary technologies that are not patentable and which may not be adequately protected through trade secrets  if for example a competitor were to independently develop duplicative  similar or alternative technologies 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves many complex legal and technical issues 
there is no clear policy involving the breadth of claims allowed in patents or the degree of protection afforded under patents 
although we believe our potential rights under patent applications provide a competitive advantage  it is possible that patent applications owned by or licensed to us will not result in patents being issued  or that  if issued  the patents will not give us an advantage over competitors with similar products or technology  nor can we assure you that we can obtain  maintain and enforce all ownership and other proprietary rights necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition to the intellectual property and other rights described above  we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets  trademarks and confidential information  particularly when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or available 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect and it is possible that others will independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and invention assignment agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
however  it is possible that these agreements will not provide effective protection of our confidential information or  in the event of unauthorized use of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of third parties  provide adequate or effective remedies or protection 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain intellectual property rights to develop or market our products or we infringe on a third party patent or other intellectual property rights  we may need to alter or terminate a product development program 
if our vaccine technology or our product candidates infringe or conflict with the rights of others  we may not be able to manufacture or market our product candidates  which could have a material and adverse effect on us and on our collaboration with merck kgaa 
issued patents held by others may limit our ability to develop commercial products 
all issued patents are entitled to a presumption of validity under the laws of the united states 
if we need licenses to such patents to permit us to develop or market our product candidates  we may be required to pay significant fees or royalties  and we cannot be certain that we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
competitors or third parties may obtain patents that may cover subject matter we use in developing the technology required to bring our products to market  that we use in producing our products  or that we use in treating patients with our products 
we know that others have filed patent applications in various jurisdictions that relate to several areas in which we are developing products 
some of these patent applications have already resulted in the issuance of patents and some are still pending 
we may be required to alter our processes or product candidates  pay licensing fees or cease activities 
certain parts of our vaccine technology  including the muc antigen  originated from third party sources 
these third party sources include academic  government and other research laboratories  as well as the public domain 
if use of technology incorporated into or used to produce our product candidates is challenged  or if our processes or product candidates conflict with patent rights of others  third parties could bring legal actions against us  in europe  the united states and elsewhere  claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products 
additionally  it is not possible to predict with certainty what patent claims may issue from pending applications 
in the united states  for example  patent prosecution can proceed in secret prior to issuance of a patent 
as a result  third parties may be able to obtain patents with claims relating to our product candidates  which they could attempt to assert against us 
further  as we develop our products  third parties may assert that we infringe the patents currently held or licensed by them and it is difficult to provide the outcome of any such action 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or forced to cease some aspect of our business operations  as a result of claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights  which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to protect our rights in  or to use  our technology 
there has been significant litigation in the biotechnology industry over patents and other proprietary rights and if we become involved in any litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources  regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
others may challenge the validity  inventorship  ownership  enforceability or scope of our patents or other technology used in or otherwise necessary for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we may not be successful in defending against any such challenges 
if these legal actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license  grant cross licenses and pay substantial royalties in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products 
moreover  the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents to prevent infringement or to otherwise protect our proprietary rights can be substantial 
if the outcome of litigation is 
table of contents adverse to us  third parties may be able to use the challenged technologies without payment to us 
there is also the risk that  even if the validity of a patent were upheld  a court would refuse to stop the other party from using the inventions  including on the ground that its activities do not infringe that patent 
there is no assurance that we would prevail in any legal action or that any license required under a third party patent would be made available on acceptable terms or at all 
if any of these events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely effected 
if any products we develop become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations  third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives  our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be impaired 
our future revenues  profitability and access to capital will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect a number of federal  state and foreign proposals to control the cost of drugs through government regulation 
we are unsure of the impact recent health care reform legislation may have on our business or what actions federal  state  foreign and private payers may take in response to the recent reforms 
therefore  it is difficult to provide the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the united states  private health insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  particularly for indications for which there is no current effective treatment or for which medical care typically is not sought 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product research and development 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payers for use of our products  our products may fail to achieve market acceptance and our results of operations will be harmed 
governments often impose strict price controls  which may adversely affect our future profitability 
we intend to seek approval to market our future products in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
if we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions  we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product 
in some foreign countries  particularly in the european union  prescription drug pricing is subject to government control 
in these countries  pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug candidate 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries  we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our future product to other available therapies 
in addition  it is unclear what impact  if any  recent health care reform legislation will have on the price of drugs in the united states 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or collectively  ppaca  became law in the united states 
ppaca substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry 
we anticipate that the ppaca  as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future  may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and downward pressure on the price for any approved product  and could seriously harm our prospects 
any reduction in reimbursement from medicare or other government programs may result 
table of contents in a similar reduction in payments from private payers 
if reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount  or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
we face potential product liability exposure  and if successful claims are brought against us  we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization 
the use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers  health care providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims  we will incur substantial liabilities 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  impairment of our business reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants  loss of revenues  and the inability to commercialize our product candidates 
although we currently have product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials for expenses or losses up to a million aggregate annual limit  our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any or all expenses or losses we may suffer 
moreover  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and  in the future  we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development  but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing 
on occasion  large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on products that had unanticipated side effects 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and  if judgments exceed our insurance coverage  could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing products before  or more successfully  than we do 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive  and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address cancer indications for which we are currently developing products or for which we may develop products in the future 
our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design  development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect any product candidate that we commercialize with our collaborative partners or on our own will compete with existing  market leading products and products in development 
l blp there are currently two products approved as maintenance therapy following treatment of inoperable locoregional stage iii nsclc with induction chemotherapy  tarceva erlotinib  a targeted small molecule from genentech  inc  a member of the roche group  and alimta pemetrexed  a chemotherapeutic from eli lilly and company 
l blp has not been tested in combination with or in comparison to these products 
it is possible 
table of contents that other existing or new agents will be approved for this indication 
in addition  there are at least three vaccines in development for the treatment of nsclc  including gsk s mage a vaccine in phase  novarx corporation s lucanix in phase and transgene s tg in phase tg also targets muc  although using technology different from l blp of these vaccines  only lucanix is being developed as a maintenance therapy in stage iii nsclc  the same indication as l blp however  subsequent development of these vaccines  including l blp  may result in additional direct competition 
small molecule products 
we have two small molecule programs in development  px and ont px is an inhibitor of pi kinase 
we are aware of numerous companies that have entered clinical trials with competing compounds targeting the same protein  many of which have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and drug development resources than we do 
among these competitors are novartis phase  roche genentech phase  bayer phase  sanofi aventis phase  chugai phase and glaxosmithkline phase 
there are also several approved targeted therapies for cancer and in development against which px might compete 
ont is a small molecule inhibitor of the bcl anti apoptotic protein family 
we are aware of at least one company that is developing a competing drug that targets the same family  ascenta phase 
there are also several approved targeted therapies for cancer and in development against which our small molecule product candidates might compete 
many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and personnel resources than we have 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have 
our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to design and develop products that are superior to other products in the market  attract qualified scientific  medical  sales and marketing and commercial personnel  obtain patent and or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates  obtain required regulatory approvals  and successfully collaborate with others in the design  development and commercialization of new products 
established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete 
in addition  any new product that competes with a generic market leading product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy  convenience  tolerability and safety in order to overcome severe price competition and to be commercially successful 
if we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors  our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer 
if we are unable to enter into agreements with partners to perform sales and marketing functions  or build these functions ourselves  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates 
we currently do not have any internal sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize any of our product candidates  we must either acquire or internally develop a sales  marketing and distribution infrastructure or enter into agreements with partners to perform these services for us 
under our agreements with merck kgaa  merck kgaa is responsible for developing and commercializing l blp  and any problems with that relationship could delay the development and commercialization of l blp additionally  we may not be able to enter into arrangements with respect to our product candidates not covered by the merck kgaa agreements on commercially acceptable terms  
table of contents if at all 
factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates without entering into arrangements with third parties include our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel  the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products  the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines  and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating a sales and marketing organization 
if we are not able to partner with a third party and are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing and distribution infrastructure  we will have difficulty commercializing our product candidates  which would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
if we lose key personnel  or we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel on a cost effective basis  it would be more difficult for us to manage our existing business operations and to identify and pursue new growth opportunities 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  clinical  manufacturing  and management personnel 
in addition  future growth will require us to continue to implement and improve our managerial  operational and financial systems  and continue to retain  recruit and train additional qualified personnel  which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
any difficulties in hiring or retaining key personnel or managing this growth could disrupt our operations 
the competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense 
we are highly dependent on our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified management  clinical and scientific personnel 
due to our limited resources  we may not be able to effectively recruit  train and retain additional qualified personnel 
if we are unable to retain key personnel or manage our growth effectively  we may not be able to implement our business plan 
furthermore  we have not entered into non competition agreements with all of our key employees 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
the loss of the services of existing personnel  the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  and the loss of our employees to our competitors would harm our research and development programs and our business 
our business is subject to increasingly complex environmental legislation that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
our business may involve the use of hazardous material  which will require us to comply with environmental regulations 
we face increasing complexity in our product development as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of many of our product candidates 
if we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury or violates laws  we may be liable for damages 
environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial position 
we maintain insurance under our general liability policy for any liability associated with our hazardous materials activities  and it is possible in the future that our coverage would be insufficient if we incurred a material environmental liability 

table of contents if we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls  our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired  which would adversely affect our consolidated operating results  our ability to operate our business  and our stock price and could result in litigation or similar actions 
ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be re evaluated frequently 
failure on our part to have effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition  and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall dramatically 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap 
our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company will have been detected 
for the year ended december   we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal controls that is described in item a controls and procedures management s report on internal control over financial reporting  of our annual report on form k a for the year ended december  remediation of the material weakness was fully completed as of december  we cannot be certain that the actions we are taking to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient or that we will be able to implement our planned processes and procedures in a timely manner 
in future periods  if the process required by section of the sarbanes oxley act reveals any other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies  the correction of any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could require additional remedial measures which could be costly and time consuming 
in addition  in such a case  we may be unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis 
any associated accounting restatement could create a significant strain on our internal resources and cause delays in our release of quarterly or annual financial results and the filing of related reports  increase our cost and cause management distraction 
any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth 
risks related to the ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market prices for and trading volumes of securities of biotechnology companies  including our securities  have been historically volatile 
in particular  we experienced significant volatility after we and merck kgaa announced in december that l blp failed to meet its primary endpoint in a phase trial 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  including the results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials by us  our collaborators  our competitors and or companies that are developing products that are similar to ours regardless of whether such products are potentially competitive with ours  
table of contents public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others technological innovations or new therapeutic products  governmental regulations  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  litigation  comments by securities analysts  the issuance of additional shares of common stock  or securities convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  shares of our common stock in connection with financings  acquisitions or otherwise  the incurrence of debt  general market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole  and political instability  natural disasters  war and or events of terrorism 
in addition  in the past  following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
we may seek to raise additional capital in the future  however  such capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all  when or as we require additional funding 
if we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  our common stock  our existing stockholders would experience further dilution 
we expect that we will seek to raise additional capital from time to time in the future 
for example  in connection with our april underwritten public offering  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
future financings may involve the issuance of debt  equity and or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities 
these financings may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all when and as we require funding 
if we are able to consummate such financings  the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected and or the terms of such financings may adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders 
any failure to obtain additional working capital when required would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and would be expected to result in a decline in our stock price 
any issuances of our common stock  preferred stock  or securities such as warrants or notes that are convertible into  exercisable or exchangeable for  our capital stock  would have a dilutive effect on the voting and economic interest of our existing stockholders 
in february we entered into an agreement with cowen and company  llc to sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of  from time to time  through an at the market equity offering program under which cowen will act as sales agent 
if we access the at the market equity offering program  we will set the parameters for the sale of shares  including the number of shares to be issued  the time period during which sales are requested to be made  limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made 
subject to the terms and conditions of our agreement with cowen  they may sell the shares by methods deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule under the securities act  including sales made directly on the nasdaq global market or other trading market or through a market maker 
the sale of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to our agreement with cowen will have a dilutive impact on our existing stockholders 
sales by us through cowen could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly 
sales of our common stock under such agreement  
table of contents or the perception that such sales will occur  could encourage short sales by third parties  which could contribute to the further decline of our stock price 
because we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock  stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common shares and have no present intention to pay any dividends in the future 
we are not profitable and do not expect to earn any material revenues for at least several years  if at all 
as a result  we intend to use all available cash and liquid assets in the development of our business 
any future determination about the payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings  if any  capital requirements  operating and financial conditions and on such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
as a result  the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 
we can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of a stockholder of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with designations  rights  and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock 
for example  an issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  limit or eliminate any payments that the holders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation  or otherwise adversely affect the market price or our common stock 
we have in the past  and we may at any time in the future  issue additional shares of authorized preferred stock 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in future periods  which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we believe they will continue to do so in the future 
some of these fluctuations may be more pronounced than they were in the past as a result of the issuance by us in may and september of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with equity financings 
as of december   there were outstanding warrants from the may and september financings exercisable for up to  shares of our common stock and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
these warrants are classified as a liability 
accordingly  the fair value of the warrants is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting date with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model can result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
due to the classification of such warrants and other factors  quarterly results of operations are difficult to forecast  and period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be predictive of future performance 
in one or more future quarters  our results of operations 
table of contents may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline regardless of our operating performance 
our management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock and may not use such proceeds in ways that increase the value of our stock price 
in april  we generated approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
we will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from the sale of those shares and the sale  if any  of additional shares of common stock to cowen pursuant to the at the market equity offering program that replaced our committed equity line financing facility and we could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock 
our failure to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  delay the development of our product candidates and cause the price of our common stock to decline

overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer 
our goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients 
our cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells  while our small molecule compounds are designed to inhibit the activity of specific cancer related proteins 
we are advancing our product candidates through in house development efforts and strategic collaborations 
our lead cancer vaccine product candidate  l blp formerly known as stimuvax  is being evaluated for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have granted an exclusive  worldwide license to merck kgaa of darmstadt  germany  or merck kgaa  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of l blp in december merck kgaa announced that the phase start trial of l blp did not meet its primary endpoint of an improvement in overall survival in patients with unresectable  locally advanced stage iiia or stage iiib nsclc 
merck kgaa also announced  however  that notable treatment effects were seen for l blp in certain subgroups 
merck kgaa has stated that they are consulting with external experts and regulatory authorities to determine potential next steps  if any  for l blp the ongoing clinical program of l blp that includes studies in the asia pacific region is continuing pending discussion with relevant regulatory agencies 
we have also initiated a phase trial for ont  a cancer vaccine directed against a target similar to l blp  which is proprietary to us 
in addition to our vaccine product candidates  we have developed novel vaccine technology we may further develop ourselves and or license to others  including the novel vaccine adjuvant pet lipid a 
we are also developing novel targeted small molecules for the treatment of cancer 
our most advanced targeted small molecule is px  for which we are currently conducting four phase trials in a variety of cancer indications with results expected in px is an irreversible  pan isoform phosphatidylinositol kinase  or pi kinase inhibitor we obtained when we acquired prolx pharmaceuticals corporation in we are also developing ont  a preclinical pan inhibitor of the b cell lymphoma  or bcl  family of anti apoptotic proteins 
overexpression of one or more of the bcl family of proteins is common in most human cancers 
we obtained rights to ont as part of an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with sbmri 
as of the date of this report  we have not licensed any rights to our small molecules to any third party and retain all development  commercialization and manufacturing rights 
we believe the quality and breadth of our product candidate pipeline  strategic collaborations and scientific team will potentially enable us to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of novel  commercialized therapeutics for major diseases 

table of contents in may  we entered into a collaborative arrangement with merck kgaa to pursue joint global product research  clinical development and commercialization of l blp the collaboration covered the entire field of oncology for this product candidate and was documented in collaboration and supply agreements  which we refer to as the agreements 
in connection with the execution of the collaboration and supply agreements  we received up front cash payments of million and million  respectively 
in january  we and merck kgaa entered into a binding letter of intent  pursuant to which the agreements were amended and we granted additional rights to merck kgaa 
in august  we amended and restated our collaboration and supply agreements with merck kgaa  which we refer to as the agreements  which restructured the agreements and formalized the terms set forth in the letter of intent 
as a result of the agreements  merck kgaa obtained an exclusive world wide license with respect to the development and commercialization of l blp we had responsibility for the development of the manufacturing process and plans for the scale up for commercial manufacturing and merck kgaa had the right to act as a secondary manufacturer of l blp we also continued to be responsible for manufacture of the clinical and commercial supply of l blp for which merck kgaa agreed to pay us our cost of goods and provisions for certain contingent payments to us related to manufacturing scale up and process transfer were added 
the entry into the agreements triggered a million payment to us contemplated by the letter of intent  which we received in september in addition  under the agreements  we were entitled to receive a million payment tied to the transfer of certain assays and methodology related to the manufacture of l blp  which we received in december  a million payment tied to the transfer of certain l blp manufacturing technology  which we received in may  and a million payment tied to the earlier of receipt of the first manufacturing run at commercial scale of l blp and december   which we received in december  various additional contingent payments up to a maximum of million in the aggregate tied to a biologics license application  or bla  submission for first and second cancer indications  for regulatory approval of first and second cancer indications  and for various sales milestones  royalties in the low twenties based on net sales outside of north america and royalties based on net sales inside of north america with percentages in the mid twenties  depending on the territory in which the net sales occur 
if the manufacturing process payments due by december  were paid in full  the royalty rates would be reduced in all territories by  relative to the agreements and the letter of intent 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with merck kgaa which replaced the agreements 
pursuant to the license agreement  in addition to the rights granted pursuant to the agreements  we licensed to merck kgaa the exclusive right to manufacture l blp and the right to sublicense to other persons all such rights licensed  we transferred certain manufacturing know how to merck kgaa  we agreed not to develop any product  other than ont  that is competitive with l blp and we granted to merck a right of first negotiation in connection with any contemplated collaboration or license agreement with respect to the development or commercialization of ont upon the execution of the license agreement  all of our future performance obligations related to the collaboration for the clinical development and development of the manufacture process of l blp were removed and our continuing involvement in the development and manufacturing of l blp ceased 
in return for the license of manufacturing rights and transfer of manufacturing know how  we received an up front cash payment of approximately million 
the provisions with respect to contingent payments under the agreements remained unchanged  and we may receive cash payments of up to million  which figure excludes the million received in december and million received prior to the execution of the 
table of contents license agreement 
we are also entitled to receive royalties based on net sales of l blp ranging from a percentage in the mid teens to high single digits  depending on the territory in which the net sales occur 
royalty rates were reduced relative to prior agreements by a specified amount that we believe is consistent with our estimated costs of goods  manufacturing scale up costs and certain other expenses assumed by merck kgaa 
in connection with the entry into the license agreement  we also entered into an asset purchase agreement  which  together with the license agreement we refer to as the agreements  pursuant to which we sold to merck kgaa certain assets related to the manufacture and inventory of l blp  placebo and raw materials  and merck kgaa agreed to assume certain liabilities related to the manufacture of l blp and our obligations related to the lease of our edmonton  alberta  canada facility 
the plant and equipment in the edmonton facility and inventory of raw materials  work in process and finished goods were sold for a purchase price of million including the assumption of lease obligation of  and million  respectively 
the purchase price of the inventory was first offset against advances made in prior periods resulting in net cash to us of million 
in addition  employees at our former edmonton facility were transferred to an affiliate of merck kgaa  significantly reducing our operating expenses related to this program 
for additional information regarding our relationship with merck kgaa  see note collaborative and license agreements of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have not developed a therapeutic product to the commercial stage 
as a result  with the exception of the unusual effects of the transaction with merck kgaa in december  our revenue has been limited to date  and we do not expect to recognize any material revenue for the foreseeable future 
in particular  our ability to generate revenue in future periods will depend substantially on the progress of ongoing clinical trials for l blp and our small molecule compounds  our ability to obtain development and commercialization partners for our small molecule compounds  merck kgaa s success in obtaining regulatory approval for l blp  our success in obtaining regulatory approval for our small molecule compounds  and merck kgaa s and our respective abilities to establish commercial markets for these drugs 
any adverse clinical results relating to l blp or any decision by merck kgaa to discontinue its efforts to develop and commercialize the product would have a material and adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our small molecule compounds are much earlier in the development stage than l blp  and we do not expect to realize any revenues associated with the commercialization of our products candidates for the foreseeable future 
the continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing costs and the expenses of seeking regulatory approval 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies  all of our clinical trials and all of the manufacturing of cgmp material 
we expect expenditures associated with these activities to increase in future years as we continue the development of our small molecule product candidates and ont we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million 
we incurred a net loss of million for compared to a net loss of million for primarily due to the noncash income from the change in the fair value of the warrant liability 
the change in the fair value of the warrant liability is primarily due to changes in our stock price 
in future periods  we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our research and development activities with respect to our small molecules product candidates 
to date we have funded 
table of contents our operations principally through the sale of our equity securities  cash received through our strategic alliance with merck kgaa  government grants  debt financings  and equipment financings 
in september  we completed a financing in which we raised approximately million in net proceeds 
in addition  in february  we entered into a loan and security agreement  which we refer to as the loan agreement  pursuant to which we incurred million in term loan indebtedness 
in june  we paid approximately million to extinguish our term loan prior to its maturity date 
in may  we completed a financing  in which we issued an aggregate of million shares and generated net proceeds of approximately million 
in october  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a per share price of approximately resulting in net proceeds of million 
in november  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price of approximately resulting in net proceeds of million 
during  warrants with respect to  underlying shares of our common stock were exercised  resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million 
in april  we completed a financing in which we issued an aggregate of million shares and generated net proceeds of approximately million 
see liquidity and capital resources below and note notes payable of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information 
because we have limited revenues and substantial research and development and operating expenses  we expect that we will in the future seek additional working capital funding from the sale of equity  debt securities  or loans or the licensing of rights to our product candidates 
key financial metrics revenue we had no revenue in our revenue in and was immaterial  however  the type of revenue described in this section  which relates to revenue from collaborative arrangements  is relevant for and historically  our revenue has been derived from payments under our collaborative and license agreements 
licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements 
revenue from collaborative and license agreements consists of up front cash payments for initial technology access or licensing fees and contingent payments triggered by the occurrence of specified events or other contingencies derived from our collaborative and license agreements 
royalties from the commercial sale of products derived from our collaborative and license agreements are reported as licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
for more information on revenue recognition for licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements  see critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements below 
expenses research and development 
research and development consists of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  and clinical trial and manufacturing costs 
these expenses include external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  technology access and licensing fees related to the use of proprietary third party technologies  employee and consultant related expenses  including salaries  share based compensation expense  benefits  and related costs  allocated facility overhead  which includes depreciation and amortization  and third party supplier expenses 
we recognize research and development expenses  including those paid to third parties  as they have been incurred 

table of contents our research and development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
similarly  any of our continuing product candidates may be found to be ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to complete clinical trials than we have anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaboration or license agreements with larger third party pharmaceutical companies to complete the development and commercialization of our small molecule or other product candidates  and it is unknown whether or on what terms we will be able to secure collaboration or license agreements for any candidate 
in addition  it is difficult to provide the impact of collaboration or license agreements  if any  on the development of product candidates 
establishing product development relationships with large pharmaceutical companies may or may not accelerate the time to completion or reduce our costs with respect to the development and commercialization of any product candidate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  share based compensation expense  and related costs for personnel in our executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal  consulting  accounting services and allocation of our facility costs  which includes depreciation and amortization 
investment and other income expense  net 
net investment and other income expense consists of interest and other income on our cash  short term investments  long term investments and foreign exchange gains and losses 
our investments consist of debt securities of u 
s government agencies  corporate bonds and certificates of deposit insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
in  we were awarded a federal grant for million under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  which was recorded as other income since the amounts pertained to expenses incurred in and in we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt which consists of a prepayment penalty of on the outstanding principal  the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized debt discount and legal expenses 
for more information  see note notes payable of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest paid and accrued and includes non cash amortization of the debt discount and capitalized loan fees 
for more information  see note notes payable of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
change in fair value of warrants 
warrants issued in connection with our securities offering in september and may are classified as a liability due to their settlement features and  as such  were recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the closing of the transaction 
the warrants are marked to market for each financial reporting period  with changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in our statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of significant judgment and estimates for the inputs used in the model 
for more information  see note fair value measurements and note share capital of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
income tax benefit provision for income tax 
due to our history of significant losses  we do not recognize the benefit of net operating losses and have established a full valuation allowance  since it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized 
in we 
table of contents recorded a tax benefit for recovery of taxes paid in the previous year 
in and  no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been included in this report beginning on page f and which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make significant estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of our consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  goodwill impairment  share based compensation  and warrant liability 
revenue recognition we had no revenue in our revenue in and was immaterial  however  the type of revenue described in this section  which relates to revenue from collaborative arrangements  is relevant for and we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine whether the deliverables represent one or more units of accounting 
revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  through december  have been accounted for in accordance with accounting standards that state that a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting if the following separation criteria are met the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  the delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 
the relevant revenue recognition accounting policy is then applied to each unit of accounting 
effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance on a prospective basis and will no longer rely on objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the elements in a revenue arrangement in order to separate a deliverable into a separate unit of accounting 

table of contents we will instead use a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which will be used to determine the allocation of consideration to each unit of accounting under an arrangement 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
this new guidance will be applied by us to revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  beginning january  as of december   we have not entered into any new revenue arrangements  or materially modified any of our existing  revenue arrangements and as such  these provisions do not apply 
we have historically generated revenue from the following activities licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements 
revenue from collaborative and license agreements consists of up front cash payments for initial technology access or licensing fees and contingent payments triggered by the occurrence of specified events or other contingencies derived from our collaborative and license agreements 
royalties from the commercial sale of products derived from our collaborative and license agreements are reported as licensing  royalties and other revenue 
if we have continuing obligations under a collaborative agreement and the deliverables within the collaboration cannot be separated into their own respective units of accounting  we utilize a multiple attribution model for revenue recognition as the revenue related to each deliverable within the arrangement should be recognized upon the culmination of the separate earnings processes and in such a manner that the accounting matches the economic substance of the deliverables included in the unit of accounting 
as such  up front cash payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of performance under the applicable agreement 
if we have no continuing obligations under a license agreement  or a license deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting included in a collaborative arrangement  consideration that is allocated to the license deliverable is recognized as revenue upon commencement of the license term and contingent payments are recognized as revenue upon the occurrence of the events or contingencies provided for in such agreement  assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance for recognizing milestone revenue  which will be applied on a prospective basis 
consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone for research or development deliverables will be recognized in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement  such that it is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  relates solely to past performance  and is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
the provisions of the new milestone revenue guidance apply only to those milestones payable for research or development activities and do not apply to contingent payments for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a collaborative partner s performance 
our existing collaboration agreements entail no performance obligations on our part  and milestone payments would be earned based on the collaborative partner s performance  therefore  milestone payments under existing agreements are considered contingent payments to be accounted for outside of the new milestone revenue guidance 
we will recognize contingent payments as revenue upon the occurrence of the specified events  assuming the payments are deemed collectible at that time 

table of contents with respect to our arrangement with merck kgaa  we determined that the estimated useful life of the products and estimated period of our ongoing obligations corresponded to the estimated life of the issued patents for such product 
under the agreements  payments that we received were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period from the date of execution of the agreements to we chose that amortization period because  at the time  we believed it reflected an anticipated period of market exclusivity based upon our expectation of the life of the patent protection  after which the market entry of competitive products would likely occur 
payments received pursuant to the letter of intent and the agreements were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the remaining estimated product life of l blp  which was until upon entering into the agreements  all of our future performance obligations related to our collaboration with merck kgaa regarding l blp were removed and our continuing involvement in the development and manufacturing of l blp ceased  therefore  we recognized the balance of all previously recorded deferred revenue relating to our arrangement with merck kgaa 
similarly  our receipt of the final manufacturing process transfer milestone payment in december was recognized since we had no continuing obligations pursuant to such arrangement 
any future contingent payments we receive pursuant to the license agreement will be immediately recognized in revenue 
goodwill impairment goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed annually for impairment on october of each year  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
as of december   we had one reporting unit and there was an excess of fair value compared to the carrying value 
there were no impairment charges recorded for any of the periods presented 
share based compensation we maintain a share option plan under which an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlie outstanding options as of december  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock were available for future issuance 
we maintain an employee stock purchase plan  or espp  under which a total of  shares of common stock were reserved for sale to employees of the company 
as of december   there were  shares reserved for future purchases 
we maintain a restricted share unit plan under which an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlie restricted stock units  or rsus  as of december  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock were available for future issuance as of december  we have generally granted options to our employees and directors under the share option plan  and we have granted rsus to non employee directors under the rsu plan 
pursuant to an october amendment to the rsu plan  we are required to settle of the shares of our common stock otherwise deliverable in connection with the vesting of any rsu and deliver to each non employee director an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date 
the amendment is designed to facilitate satisfaction of the non employee directors income tax obligation with respect to the vested rsus 
this modification resulted in the rsus being classified as a liability 
the outstanding rsu awards are required to be remeasured at each reporting date until settlement of the award  and any changes in valuation are recorded as compensation expense for the period 
to the extent that the liability recorded in the balance sheet is less than the original award value  the difference is recognized in equity 
we use the closing share price of our shares in the nasdaq global market at the reporting or settlement date to determine the fair value of rsus 
we use the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for our share option plan and employee stock purchase plan awards  which requires the use of highly subjective and 
table of contents complex assumptions to determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest as non cash expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight line basis for the entire award in our consolidated statements of operations 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we base our risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option on the yield available on a us treasury security with an equivalent expected term 
the expected life of options in years represents the period of time stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on the simplified method 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock for a period equal to the stock option s expected life 
for more information  see note share based compensation of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
warrant liability in may and september  we issued warrants to purchase  and  shares of our common stock respectively in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants 
these warrants are classified as liabilities due to potential cash settlement upon the occurrence of certain transactions specified in the warrant agreement 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the outstanding warrants is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting period with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model can result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated 
overview years ended december  in millions  except per share amounts revenue operating expenses other income expense  net change in fair value of warrant liability benefit for income tax net loss loss per share basic loss per share diluted we incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the decrease in our net loss was primarily due to million non cash income from the change in the fair value of our warrant liability during the year ended december  compared to a million non cash loss during the year ended december   partially offset by increases in research and development expenses primarily related to the development of px 
table of contents the increase in our net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in was primarily driven by a million non cash loss from the change in the fair value of our warrant liability during the year ended december  compared to a million non cash income charge during the year ended december  in addition  the increase in our net loss was also due to increases in research and development expenses related to the development of px and ont this increase was partly offset by lower general and administrative professional expenses incurred in income or loss associated with the change in fair value of the warrant liability are the result of the remeasurement of the fair value of the warrant liability at each reporting date 
changes in the fair value of the warrant liability are primarily attributable to increases or decreases in our stock price 
for more information  see note fair value measurements of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
based on our development plans for our small molecule and vaccine candidates  we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
revenue years ended december  in millions licensing revenues from collaborative and license agreements we did not recognize any revenue for the years ended december  and during  we recognized million of previously deferred revenue relating to an agreement with prima biomed limited as we have no continuing performance obligations related to such agreement 
we do not expect revenue in research and development years ended december  in millions research and development the million  or  increase in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily driven by higher clinical trial expenses of million related to the development of px and increased salaries and benefits expense of million attributable to increased headcount 
such increase was partly offset by lower preclinical and manufacturing development expenses of million  including a reduction in license payments due to a million payment to sbmri in for more information see note collaborative and license agreements of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  long term investments and working capital as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  money market funds and securities with an initial maturity of less than days 
our short term investments are invested in debt securities of u 
s government agencies and corporate bonds with maturities not exceeding months from the reporting date 
our long term investments are invested in debt securities of u 
s government agencies with maturities exceeding months from the reporting date 
our primary source of cash has historically been proceeds from the issuance of equity securities  exercise of warrants  debt and equipment financings  and payments to us under grants  licensing and collaboration agreements 
these proceeds have been used to fund our operations 
our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to net proceeds of million from our april underwritten public offering of common stock 
such increase was partially offset by cash used to fund our operations of million  net purchase of investments of million  principal payments of million on notes payable  repayment of million to gecc to extinguish the term loan and purchase of equipment in the amount of million 
as of december   our working capital was million compared to million as of december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 
table of contents million and an increase in short term investments of million as a result of the application of the net proceeds of our april underwritten public offering of common stock 
in addition  such increase was also attributable to a decrease in current portion of notes payable of million 
on february   we entered into a loan agreement with ge capital  pursuant to which the lenders extended to us a term loan with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the proceeds of the term loan  after payment of lender fees and expenses  were approximately million

on april   we closed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after deducting the underwriters discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us  were approximately million 
we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months 
nevertheless  we expect that we will require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to continue the development of products in our pipeline and to expand our product portfolio 
we would expect to seek additional financing from the sale and issuance of equity or debt securities  but we cannot provide assurance that financing will be available when and as needed or that  if available  the financing terms will be commercially reasonable 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when and if we require  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
to the extent we issue additional equity securities  our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our net loss 
however  operating cash flows differ from net loss as a result of non cash charges or differences in the timing of cash flows  changes in warrant liabilities and earnings recognition 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in the increase in net cash used in operating activities for as compared to was primarily due to an increase in research and development expenses related to increased activity in the development of px and ont net cash used in operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in the increase in net cash used in operating activities for as compared to was primarily due to an increase in research and development expenses related to increased activity in the development of px and ont  which was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses

table of contents cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities during was million  which consisted primarily million of proceeds from our april common stock offering

contractual obligations and contingencies in our continuing operations  we have entered into long term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities  the provision of goods and services  and the acquisition of technology access rights  among others

in connection with the acquisition of prolx  we may become obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of prolx upon satisfaction of certain milestones 
we may become obligated to issue shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million determined based on a weighted average trading price at the time of issuance upon the initiation of the first phase clinical trial for a prolx product that qualifies as a subject product as such term is defined in the prolx acquisition agreement  which we refer to as a prolx product 
we may also become obligated to issue shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million determined based on a weighted average trading price at the time of issuance upon regulatory approval of a prolx product in a major market 
under certain licensing arrangements for technologies incorporated into our product candidates  we are contractually committed to payment of ongoing licensing fees and royalties  as well as contingent payments when certain milestones as defined in the agreements have been achieved 
guarantees and indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we have entered into agreements with our collaboration partners  vendors  and other persons and entities that include guarantees or indemnity provisions 
for example  our agreements with merck kgaa contain certain tax indemnification provisions  and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during the period presented  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
it allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting pronouncement on january  has no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  fasb and the international accounting standards board  or iasb issued guidance on presentation of items within other comprehensive income 
the guidance requires an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity has been eliminated 
although the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under existing guidance 
we adopted these standards using the two separate but consecutive statements approach on january  for all periods presented  which impacted presentation only and had no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  fasb and the iasb published converged standards on fair value measurement and disclosure 
the standards do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
the standards clarified some existing rules and provided guidance for additional disclosures the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement are relevant only when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and are not relevant when measuring the fair value of financial assets or of liabilities  when measuring the fair value of instruments classified in equity for example  equity issued in a business combination  the entity should measure it from the perspective of a market participant that holds that instrument as an asset  and quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in level measurements should be included 
the amendments in this update are applied prospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement on january  only impacted the disclosures within our financial statements  and not our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are not exposed to any significant foreign exchange risk 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investment totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these assets as a result of changes in interest rates since a majority of these assets are of a short term nature 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
a basis points decline in interest rates  occurring january  and sustained throughout the period ended december   would have resulted in a decline in investment income of approximately  for that same period
