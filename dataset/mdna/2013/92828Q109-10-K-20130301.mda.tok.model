the company released its valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of on all net deferred tax assets other than those related to capital losses and state net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company offset all changes in its deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance which led to an effective tax rate that was substantially different from the applicable statutory tax rates 
in addition primarily as a result of business changes and growth  the company s future state tax rate is expected to decrease in the current and future years as compared to this 
table of contents change resulted in the reduction of the recorded value of the company s state net deferred tax asset of million 
the company may experience continued volatility in its state effective tax rate as the company continues to experience changes in its business and as states seek to increase revenue 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  the company determined that recent historical operating results and projections of future income provided sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of its deferred tax assets would be realized

our effective tax rate was  for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate in as compared to is primarily attributable to the release of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in in  the company maintained a valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets on items of a capital nature as well as certain state deferred tax assets where the company determined that at the current level of projected taxable income would not be sufficient to realize these assets prior to their expiration 
effects of inflation inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways 
first  inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure  especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted 
to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
secondly  the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment 
declines in the values of these assets under management could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of assets under management

net assets of consolidated sponsored investment products comprise million of total assets  million of total liabilities and million of redeemable noncontrolling interests 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
capital requirements our business does not require us to maintain significant capital balances 
our short term capital requirements  which we consider to be those capital requirements due within one year  include payment of annual incentive compensation  salary costs and other operating expenses  primarily consisting of investment research costs  professional fees and occupancy expenses 
incentive compensation  which is generally the company s largest annual operating cash payment  is paid in the first quarter of the year

for the year ended december   a total of  rsus were withheld through net share settlement by the company to settle employee tax withholding obligations 
the company paid million in employee tax withholding obligations related to the rsus withheld 
these net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced the number of shares that otherwise would have been issued as a result of the vesting 
the amount we pay in future periods will vary based on our stock price  the number of rsus vesting during the period and whether we and our employees elect to satisfy withholding taxes through net share settlement 
approximately  rsus are expected to vest in march that may require a capital outlay related to employee tax withholdings 
we currently maintain a significant portion of our assets in highly liquid positions primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and marketable securities 
our working capital was million as of december   an increase of million from million as of december   excluding investments of consolidated sponsored investment products  working capital was million 
we believe our working capital and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our short term capital requirements 
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to i invest in our organic growth  including our distribution efforts and closed end fund launches  ii seed new investment strategies and mutual funds to ensure a strong pipeline of future saleable products  iii invest in inorganic growth opportunities as they arise  iv acquire shares of our common stock  v fund ongoing and potential investments in our infrastructure to achieve greater economies of scale and a more efficient overall cost structure  and vi principal payments on our outstanding credit facility  which matures in september 
table of contents we believe we will be able to fund these uses of capital with existing working capital levels and with cash flows from operations 
we also have the ability to issue equity or debt securities and borrow under our current credit facility

current or unexpected events that could require additional liquidity may occur affecting our results of operations  access to financing and generation of cash 
capital and reserve requirements we have a subsidiary that is a broker dealer registered with the sec and is therefore subject to certain rules regarding minimum net capital  as defined by those rules

off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity  capital resources  market or credit risk support  or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the use of estimates 
actual results will vary from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries and sponsored investment products in which it has a controlling financial interest 
the company is generally considered to have a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the voting interest in an entity or otherwise has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the subsidiary 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the consolidation of sponsored investment products 
the company also evaluates for consolidation any variable interest entities vies in which the company is the primary beneficiary 
a vie is an entity in which either a the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or b the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that has the obligation to absorb a majority of the expected losses or the right to receive the majority of the residual returns 
the company evaluates whether entities in which it has an interest are vies and whether the company is the primary beneficiary of any vies identified in its analysis 
fair value measurements and fair value of financial instruments the fasb defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
asc  fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability 
classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the valuation hierarchy contains three levels as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level assets and liabilities may include debt securities and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level inputs may include observable market data such as closing market prices provided by independent pricing services after considering factors such as the yields or prices of comparable investments of comparable quality  coupon  maturity  call rights and other potential prepayments  terms and type  reported transactions  indications as to values from dealers and general market conditions 
in addition  pricing services may determine the fair value of equity securities 
table of contents traded principally in foreign markets when it has been determined that there has been a significant trend in the us equity markets or in index futures trading 
level assets and liabilities may include debt and equity securities  purchased loans and over the counter derivative contracts whose fair value is determined using a pricing model without significant unobservable market data inputs 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable in active exchange markets 
the following is a discussion of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value 
sponsored mutual funds and variable insurance funds include amounts in affiliated investment products 
the fair value of these securities are generally determined based on their published net asset values and are included as level within the hierarchy 
investments of consolidated sponsored investment products include debt and equity securities held in portfolios of sponsored funds that are consolidated by the company 
equity securities are valued at the official closing price on the exchange on which the securities are traded and categorized as level in the hierarchy 
certain non us securities may be fair valued in cases where closing prices are not readily available or are deemed to not reflect readily available market prices 
in such cases  the fair value is determined using an independent pricing service and fair valuations are categorized as level in the hierarchy 
most debt securities are valued based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities 
these investments are generally categorized as level in the hierarchy 
pricing services do not provide pricing for all securities and therefore indicative bids from dealers are utilized which are based on pricing models used by market makers in the security and are generally categorized as level in the hierarchy equity securities include securities traded on active markets and are valued at the official closing price typically last sale on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded  or if no closing price is available  at the last bid price and are categorized as level in the hierarchy 
sponsored closed end funds include amounts in affiliated investment products 
these investments are valued as level within the valuation hierarchy because they are valued through the use of quoted market prices available in active markets 
nonqualified retirement plan assets include mutual funds whose fair value is generally determined based on their published net asset value 
they are classified as level within the valuation hierarchy 
cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities equal or approximate fair value based on the short term nature of these instruments 
the estimated fair value of long term debt at december   which has a variable interest rate  approximates its carrying value 
marketable securities are reflected in the financial statements at fair value based upon publicly quoted market prices 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of goodwill  indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets was million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of identified net assets and liabilities acquired 
indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of acquired  closed end fund investment advisory contracts 
for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment tests are performed annually  or more frequently  should circumstances change  which would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
we have determined that the company has only one reporting unit for purposes of assessing the carrying value of goodwill 
for definite lived intangible assets  impairment testing is performed whenever events or 
table of contents changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the company determines the carrying value of the definite lived intangible assets is less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset we will quantify the impairment using a discounted cash flow model 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include  the estimated remaining useful life of the intangible asset  the discount rate  investment management fee rates on assets under management  and the market expense ratio factor 
definite lived intangible assets are comprised of acquired investment advisory contracts 
the company monitors the useful lives of definite lived intangible assets and revises the useful lives  if necessary  based on the circumstances 
significant judgment is required in estimating the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on our amortization expense 
all amortization expense has been  and continues to be  calculated on a straight line basis 
we apply the rules issued in accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard which amends the rules for testing goodwill for impairment by allowing an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the standard provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment to determine if additional impairment testing is necessary 
the standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   however early adoption is allowed 
the company has adopted this asu 
in assessing the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit for goodwill and each unit of accounting for indefinite lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount  we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount for each 
the identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact the fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions 
the judgment and assumptions include the identification of macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  historical trends in operating margins  trending of each unit s assets under management levels  overall financial performance  specific events such as secondary offerings and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact 
based upon our fiscal qualitative impairment analysis for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  prepared in accordance with asu and asu  we concluded that there was no requirement to do a quantitative annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test 
the key qualitative factors that led to our conclusion were i that our fiscal goodwill impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying amount  ii that our fiscal indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of our units of accounting significantly exceeded the carrying amount  iii the significant increase in our share price and market capitalization since our fiscal annual goodwill impairment analysis  iv the significant increase in our assets under management since our fiscal indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis  and iii that we continue to show positive financial performance overall and related to operating margins and performance of the underlying funds that represent the indefinite lived intangible assets recorded 
during the year ended december   no events or circumstances occurred that indicated the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets might be impaired and therefore no impairment tests were performed during this period 

table of contents no impairments have been identified or recorded by the company for the year ended december  significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
revenue recognition investment management fees  distribution and service fees and administration and transfer agent fees are recorded as revenue during the period in which services are performed 
investment management fees are earned based upon a percentage of assets under management  and are paid pursuant to the terms of the respective investment management contracts  which generally require monthly or quarterly payment 
management fees for structured finance products  such as cdos  are earned as services are rendered  but are subordinated to other interests and payable only if certain financial criteria of the underlying collateral are met  are recorded as revenue when the structured finance products are in compliance with required financial criteria and collectability is reasonably assured

investment management fees are calculated based on our assets under management 
we rely on data provided to us by mutual funds and custodians in the pricing of assets under management  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
the boards of our mutual funds and the custodians of the assets we manage have formal pricing policies and procedures over pricing of investments 
part of the fund administration services we provide includes establishing internal procedures to corroborate that mutual fund and custodial pricing appears adequate 
as of december   our total assets under management by fair value hierarchy level as defined by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  was approximately level  level and level gross investment management fees earned on long term open end mutual funds range from to of average assets under management  depending on the type of fund

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes which recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in company s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance that is recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our methodology for determining the realizability of deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our operations and consideration of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented by us  if necessary  as well as the expiration dates and amounts of carryforwards related to net operating losses and capital losses 
these estimates are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with demonstrated operating results 
the assessment also includes consideration of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities that serve as a source of income for recorded deferred tax assets 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
loss contingencies the likelihood that a loss contingency exists is evaluated using the criteria of asc  loss contingencies  and an accrued liability is recorded if the likelihood of a loss is considered both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our reasonable estimate of the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisor for the assets we manage as investment advisor 
substantially all of our revenue for the three years ended december  was derived from investment management  distribution and fund administration fees  which are typically based on the market value of assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the market value of our investments  consisting primarily of marketable securities 
at december   the fair value of marketable securities was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the fair value of marketable securities at december   our net income would change by million and our total comprehensive income would change by million for the year ended december  interest rate risk at december   the company has million outstanding under the credit facility that has a variable interest rate 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at the company s option  either libor for interest periods of   or months or an alternate base rate as defined in the credit facility agreement  plus  in each case  an applicable margin  that ranges from to 
at december  the interest rate in effect for the credit facility was 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates for the year ended december  would have changed our interest expense by approximately million
