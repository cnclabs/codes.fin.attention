therefore  mild winter temperatures could decrease the amount of natural gas sold by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s electric sales also are temperature sensitive  but less so than its natural gas sales 
the highest usage of electricity typically occurs in the summer months due to air conditioning demand and the winter months due to heating related and lighting requirements 
therefore  mild summer temperatures and mild winter temperatures could decrease the amount of electricity sold by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
also  because of this temperature sensitivity  sales by the company s distribution utilities vary from year to year  depending on weather conditions 
in addition  the company s results of operations generally reflect seasonality 
in particular  the company expects that results of operations will be positively affected during the first and fourth quarters  when sales of natural gas are typically higher due to heating related requirements  and negatively affected during the second and third quarters  when gas operating and maintenance expenses usually exceed sales margins in the period 
long term global climate change could adversely affect customer demand or cause extreme weather events that could disrupt the company s electric and natural gas distribution services 
milder winter and summer temperatures that may be due to long term global climate change could cause a decrease in the amount of natural gas and electricity sold by the company 
conversely  colder winter temperatures and warmer summer temperatures that may be due to long term global climate change could cause an increase in the amount of natural gas and electricity sold by the company 
in addition  extreme weather events such as hurricanes and severe winter storms that may be related to long term global climate change could damage facilities or result in increased service interruptions and outages and increase the company s operations and maintenance costs 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of such costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of such costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations may be adversely affected 
the company is unable to predict the impacts on its financial condition and results or operations due to changes in weather that may be related to long term global climate change 
unitil is a public utility holding company and has no operating income of its own 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on dividends and other payments received from its subsidiaries and on factors directly affecting unitil  the parent corporation 
the company cannot assure that its current annual dividend will be paid in the future 
the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to unitil depends on  among other things the actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial condition of the company s subsidiaries  the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock  mortgage bonds  long term notes and other debt issued by the company s subsidiaries  the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the existing loan agreements of the company s subsidiaries and that may be contained in future debt agreements of the company s subsidiaries  if any  and limitations that may be imposed by new hampshire  massachusetts and maine state regulatory agencies 

table of contents in addition  before the company can pay dividends on its common stock  it has to satisfy its debt obligations and comply with any statutory or contractual limitations 
the company s current annual dividend is per share of common stock  payable quarterly 
however  the company s board of directors reviews unitil s dividend policy periodically in light of the factors referred to above  and the company cannot assure the amount of dividends  if any  that may be paid in the future 
the company s electric and natural gas distribution activities including storing natural gas and supplemental gas supplies involve numerous hazards and operating risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 
any such accident or costs could adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
inherent in the company s electric and natural gas distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operating risks  including leaks  explosions  electrocutions and mechanical problems 
these hazards and risks could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  damage to natural resources and impairment of the company s operations  which could adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses in accordance with customary industry practice 
the location of pipelines  storage facilities and electric distribution equipment near populated areas including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages associated with these hazards and operating risks 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s business is subject to environmental regulation in all jurisdictions in which it operates and its costs of compliance are significant 
new  or changes to existing  environmental regulation  including those related to climate change or greenhouse gas emissions  and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s utility operations are generally subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  and the health and safety of the company s employees 
the company s utility operations also may be subject to new and emerging federal  state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change or greenhouse gas emissions including the us environmental protection agency s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties and other sanctions  imposition of remedial requirements  and issuance of injunctions to ensure future compliance 
liability under certain environmental laws and regulations is strict  joint and several in nature 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that the company will not incur significant costs and liabilities in the future 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly stringent federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations  including those related to climate change or greenhouse gas emissions  could result in increased environmental compliance costs 
catastrophic events could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the electric and natural gas utility industries are from time to time affected by catastrophic events  such as unusually severe weather and significant and widespread failures of plant and equipment 
other catastrophic occurrences  such as terrorist attacks on utility facilities  may occur in the future 
such events could inhibit the company s ability to provide electric or natural gas distribution services to its customers for an extended period  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company s operational and information systems on which it relies to conduct its business and serve customers could fail to function properly due to technological problems  a cyber attack  acts of terrorism  severe weather  a solar event  an electromagnetic event  a natural disaster  the age and condition of information technology assets  human error  or other reasons  that could disrupt the company s operations and cause the company to incur unanticipated losses and expense 
the operation of the company s extensive electricity and natural gas systems rely on evolving information technology systems and network infrastructures that are likely to become more complex as new technologies and systems are developed to establish a smart grid to monitor and manage the nation s interconnected electric transmission grids 
the company s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor  on a daily basis  a very large number of transactions  many of which are highly complex 
the failure of these information systems and networks could significantly disrupt operations  result in outages and or damages to the company s assets or operations or those of third parties on which it relies  and subject the company to claims by customers or third parties  any of which could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company s information systems  including its financial information  operational systems  metering  and billing systems  require constant maintenance  modification  and updating  which can be costly and increases the risk of errors and malfunction 
any disruptions or deficiencies in existing information systems  or disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems  could result in increased costs  the inability to track or collect revenues  the diversion of management s and employees attention and resources  and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the company s control environment  and or the company s ability to timely file required regulatory reports 
despite implementation of security and mitigation measures  all of the company s technology systems are vulnerable to impairment or failure due to cyber attacks  viruses  human errors  acts of war or terrorism and other reasons 
if the company s information technology systems were to fail or be materially impaired  the company might be unable to fulfill critical business functions and serve its customers  which could have a material effect on the company s financial conditions  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  in the ordinary course of its business  the company collects and retains sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees  customer energy usage  and other confidential information 
the theft  damage  or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data could subject the company to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws or claims from third parties and could harm the company s reputation 
public utility companies are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks  which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions 
utility companies  including the company s distribution utility subsidiaries  have a large consumer customer base and  as a result  are subject to public criticism focused on the reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  public utility commissions and other regulatory authorities and government officials  less likely to view public utility companies in a favorable light  and may cause the company to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight 
unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include more stringent laws and regulations governing the company s operations  such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements  as well as fines  penalties or other sanctions or requirements 
the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
the company s business could be adversely affected if it is unable to retain its existing customers or attract new customers 
the success of the company s business depends  in part  on its ability to maintain and increase its customer base 
the company s failure to maintain or increase its customer base could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a note references are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item  below 
overview unitil is a public utility holding company headquartered in hampton  new hampshire 
unitil is subject to regulation as a holding company system by the ferc under the energy policy act of unitil s principal business is the local distribution of electricity and natural gas to approximately  customers throughout its service territory in the states of new hampshire  massachusetts and maine 
unitil is the parent company of three wholly owned distribution utilities i unitil energy  which provides electric service in the southeastern seacoast and state capital regions of new hampshire  ii fitchburg  which provides both electric and natural gas service in the greater fitchburg area of north central massachusetts  and iii northern utilities  which provides natural gas service in southeastern new hampshire and portions of southern and central maine  including the city of portland and the lewiston auburn area 
unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities are collectively referred to as the distribution utilities 
together  the distribution utilities serve approximately  electric customers and  natural gas customers in their service territory 
in addition  unitil is the parent company of granite state  a natural gas transmission pipeline  regulated by the ferc  operating miles of underground gas transmission pipeline primarily located in maine and new hampshire 
granite state provides northern utilities with interconnection to three major natural gas pipelines and access to north american pipeline supplies 
the distribution utilities are local pipes and wires operating companies  and unitil had an investment in net utility plant of million at december  unitil s total revenue was million in  which includes revenue to recover the approved cost of purchased electricity and natural gas in rates on a fully reconciling basis 
as a result of this reconciling rate structure  the company s earnings are not affected by changes in the cost of purchased electricity and natural gas 
earnings from unitil s utility operations are derived from the return on investment in the three distribution utilities and granite state 
unitil also conducts non regulated operations principally through usource  which is wholly owned by unitil resources 
usource provides energy brokering and consulting services to a national client base of large commercial and industrial customers 
usource s total revenues were million in the company s other subsidiaries include unitil service  which provides  at cost  a variety of administrative and professional services to unitil s affiliated companies  and unitil realty  which owns and manages unitil s corporate office building and property located in hampton  new hampshire 
unitil s consolidated net income includes the earnings of the holding company and these subsidiaries 
regulation unitil is subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities 
unitil and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation as a holding company system by the ferc under the energy policy act of with regard to certain bookkeeping  accounting and reporting requirements 
unitil s utility operations related to wholesale and interstate energy business activities are also regulated by the ferc 
unitil s distribution utilities are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions  with regard to their rates  issuance of securities and other accounting and operational matters unitil energy is subject to regulation by the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  fitchburg is subject to regulation by the massachusetts department of public utilities mdpu  and northern utilities is regulated by the nhpuc and maine public utilities commission mpuc 
granite state  unitil s interstate natural gas transmission pipeline  is subject to regulation by the ferc with regard to its rates and operations 
because unitil s primary operations are subject to rate regulation  the regulatory treatment of various matters could significantly affect the company s operations and financial position 

table of contents unitil s distribution utilities deliver electricity and or natural gas to all customers in their service territory  at rates established under traditional cost of service regulation 
under this regulatory structure  unitil s distribution utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on a historical test year  in addition to earning a return on their capital investment in utility assets 
in addition  the company s distribution utilities and its natural gas transmission pipeline company may also recover certain base rate costs  including capital project spending and enhanced reliability and vegetation management programs  through annual step adjustments and cost tracker rate mechanisms 
as a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in new hampshire  massachusetts and maine  unitil s customers  with the exception of northern utilities residential customers  have the opportunity to purchase their electricity or natural gas supplies from third party energy supply vendors 
most customers  however  continue to purchase such supplies through the distribution utilities under regulated energy rates and tariffs 
unitil s distribution utilities purchase electricity or natural gas from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual approved costs of these supplies on a pass through basis  as well as certain costs associated with industry restructuring  through reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted 
in and  the company completed base rate cases for unitil energy  the electric and gas divisions of fitchburg  the new hampshire and maine divisions of northern utilities  and granite state 
the completion of these rate cases resulted in increases in annual distribution revenues of million for unitil energy  million and million for the electric and gas divisions of fitchburg  respectively  and million and million for the new hampshire and maine divisions  respectively  of northern utilities 
granite state received approval for an increase of million in annual revenue 
additionally  in and  the company completed rate filings that resulted in increases in annual revenues  through step adjustments and cost tracker rate mechanisms  of million for unitil energy  million for the electric division of fitchburg  and million for granite state 
on august   the mdpu issued an order approving revenue decoupling mechanisms rdm for the electric and natural gas divisions of fitchburg 
revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility s distribution revenue on the volume of its electricity or natural gas sales 
one of the primary purposes of decoupling is to eliminate the disincentive a utility otherwise has to encourage and promote energy conservation programs designed to reduce energy usage 
under the rdm  the company will recognize  in its consolidated statements of earnings from august  forward  distribution revenues for fitchburg based on established revenue targets 
the established revenue targets for the gas division may be subject to periodic adjustments to account for customer growth and special contracts  for which rdm does not apply 
the difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted amounts is recognized as increases or decreases in accrued revenue which form the basis for future reconciliation adjustments in periodically resetting rates for future cash recoveries from  or credits to  customers 
the company estimates that rdm applies to approximately and of its annual electric and natural gas sales volumes  respectively 
as a result  the sales margins resulting from those sales are no longer sensitive to weather and economic factors 
the company s other electric and natural gas distribution utilities are not subject to rdm 
results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
the company s results of operations are expected to reflect the seasonal nature of the natural gas business 
annual gas revenues are substantially realized during the heating season as a result of higher sales of natural gas due to cold weather 
accordingly  the results of operations are historically most favorable in the first and fourth quarters 
fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions may have a significant effect on the result of operations 
sales of electricity are generally less sensitive to weather than natural gas sales  but may also be affected by the weather conditions in both the winter and summer seasons 
on may   the company sold  shares of its common stock at a price of per share in a registered public offering 
the company used the net proceeds of approximately million 
table of contents from this offering to make equity capital contributions to its regulated utility subsidiaries  repay short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
overall  the results of operations and earnings reflect the higher number of average shares outstanding year over year 
net income and eps overview compared to the company s earnings applicable to common shareholders earnings were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over the million the company earned in earnings per common share eps were for compared to per share in as discussed above  the eps reflect the higher number of average shares outstanding year over year 
the results for were positively affected by higher natural gas and electric sales margins due to higher distribution rates and new customer growth 
margins were negatively affected in by the effect on sales of fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions year over year 
the company estimates that the mild weather in negatively impacted earnings for the gas division by about million  or per share  and the electric division by about million  or per share 
according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  was the warmest year on record for the northeast region of the united states  in which the company s service areas are located 
the company s earnings were million  or per share  for the fourth quarter of  compared to earnings of million  or per share  in the fourth quarter of earnings for include a non recurring pre tax credit of million recorded in the fourth quarter of that year in connection with the company s court appeal and the resulting favorable ruling vacating a regulatory order that had resulted in the previous charge off of purchased gas costs 
natural gas sales margins were million in  or an increase of million compared to  reflecting higher gas distribution rates and new customer growth  partially offset by lower gas therm sales  principally in the first quarter of  due to mild winter weather 
also  gas margins in include the one time recovery of million in purchased gas costs that had been charged off in a prior period 
based on weather data collected in the company s service areas  there were and fewer heating degree days in compared to and normal  respectively 
weather normalized gas therm sales excluding decoupled sales in are estimated to be higher compared to approximately of natural gas therm sales are decoupled and changes in these sales due to the weather do not affect sales margins 
electric sales margins were million in  or an increase of million compared to  reflecting higher electric distribution rates and new customer growth  partially offset by lower electric kilowatt hour kwh sales  principally in the first quarter of  due to mild winter weather 
weather normalized electric kwh sales excluding decoupled sales in are estimated to be about the same compared to approximately of electric kwh sales are decoupled and changes in these sales due to the weather do not affect sales margins 
total operation maintenance o m expenses increased million in compared to the change in o m expenses reflects higher utility operating costs of million  higher employee compensation and benefit costs of million  and higher professional fees of million 
the increase in utility operating costs in compared to includes an increase of million in new spending on vegetation management and electric reliability enhancement programs of which approximately million is recovered through cost tracker rate mechanisms that result in corresponding and offsetting increase in revenue 
also  the increase in utility operating costs includes million in higher bad debt expenses  million in higher storm costs and an increase in all other utility operating costs  net of million 
the increase in o m costs in over the prior year also reflects lower o m expenses recorded in the first quarter of due to the receipt of a non recurring insurance payment of million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to principally reflecting normal utility plant additions and amortization of regulatory assets 
local property and other taxes increased million in compared to  reflecting higher local property taxes on higher levels of utility plant in service 
federal and state income taxes increased million in due to higher pre tax earnings in compared to 
table of contents other non operating expenses decreased million in compared to interest expense  net decreased million in compared to primarily reflecting lower interest rates and lower borrowing balances as a result of the equity offering in as well as the recognition of a non recurring pre tax charge  in  against interest income of million to charge off previously accrued carrying costs that were disallowed for rate recovery 
usource  the company s non regulated energy brokering business  recorded revenues of million in  on par with usource s revenues are primarily derived from fees and charges billed to suppliers as customers take delivery of energy from these suppliers under term contracts brokered by usource 
the company will also realize future fees estimated at the end of december of million from executed energy supply term contracts running from through in  unitil s annual common dividend was  representing an unbroken record of quarterly dividend payments since trading began in unitil s common stock 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on the company s common stock of per share 
compared to the company s earnings applicable to common shareholders were million  or per share  for  an increase of million  or per share  over  reflecting higher natural gas and electric sales margins partially offset by higher utility operating and interest costs 
the results include a non recurring pre tax credit of million recorded in the fourth quarter of in connection with the company s court appeal and the resulting favorable ruling vacating a regulatory order that had resulted in the previous charge off of purchased gas costs 
the results for also include a non recurring pre tax charge of million recorded in the third quarter  related to the resolution of the ice storm cost recovery in the company s massachusetts rate case and a credit of million  recorded in the first quarter  for the proceeds from insurance related settlements 
a more detailed discussion of the company s and results of operations and a year to year comparison of changes in financial position are presented below 
gas sales  revenues and margin therm sales unitil s total therm sales of natural gas decreased in compared to the decrease in gas therm sales in the company s utility service areas reflects the effect of milder winter weather in compared to based on weather data collected in the company s service areas  there were and fewer heating degree days in compared to and normal  respectively 
weather normalized gas therm sales excluding decoupled sales in are estimated to be higher compared to the increase in weather normalized gas therm sales reflects the addition of new residential and c i business customers during the year 
approximately of natural gas therm sales are decoupled and changes in these sales due to the weather do not affect sales margins 
as discussed above  under revenue decoupling for fitchburg  distribution revenues  which are included in sales margin  will be recognized in the company s consolidated statements of earnings from august  forward  on established revenue targets and will no longer be dependent on sales volumes 
unitil s total therm sales of natural gas increased in compared to the increase in gas therm sales reflects the addition of new residential and c i business customers during the year  increased gas usage and colder weather in compared to  particularly in the first quarter of heating degree days in were greater than in weather normalized gas therm sales excluding decoupled sales in are estimated to be higher compared to the following table details total therm sales for the last three years  by major customer class therm sales millions change vs

the company analyzes operating results using gas sales margin 
gas sales margin is calculated as total gas operating revenues less the associated cost of sales  which are recorded as purchased gas and conservation load management c lm in operating expenses 
the company believes gas sales margin is a better measure to analyze profitability than total gas operating revenues because the approved cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer  resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in total gas operating revenues

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in making those estimates and assumptions  the company is sometimes required to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements 
if actual results were to differ significantly from those estimates  assumptions and judgment  the financial position of the company could be materially affected and the results of operations of the company could be materially different than reported 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies where judgments or uncertainties could materially affect the application of those policies 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to the financial statements and note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the company s principal business is the distribution of electricity and natural gas by the three distribution utilities unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities 
unitil energy and fitchburg are subject to regulation by the ferc 
fitchburg is also regulated by the mdpu  unitil energy is regulated by the nhpuc and northern utilities is regulated by the mpuc and nhpuc 
granite state  the company s natural gas transmission pipeline  is regulated by the ferc 
accordingly  the company uses the regulated operations guidance as set forth in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb codification 
in accordance with the fasb codification  the company has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 
the fasb codification specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs 
table of contents would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities 
the company s principal regulatory assets and liabilities are included on the company s consolidated balance sheet and a summary of the company s regulatory assets is provided in note thereto 
the company receives a return on investment on its regulated assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs  which can have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is probable that its regulated distribution and transmission utilities will recover their investments in long lived assets  including regulatory assets 
if the company  or a portion of its assets or operations  were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met  if such deferred costs were not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of the fasb codification topic on regulated operations 
if unable to continue to apply the fasb codification provisions for regulated operations  the company would be required to apply the provisions for the discontinuation of rate regulated accounting included in the fasb codification 
in the company s opinion  its regulated operations will be subject to the fasb codification provisions for regulated operations for the foreseeable future 
utility revenue recognition utility revenues are recognized according to regulations and are based on rates and charges approved by federal and state regulatory commissions 
revenues related to the sale of electric and gas service are recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenues are estimated 
these unbilled revenues are estimated each month based on estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer rates 
on august   the massachusetts department of public utilities mdpu issued an order approving revenue decoupling mechanisms rdm for the electric and natural gas divisions of the company s massachusetts combination electric and natural gas distribution utility  fitchburg 
revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility s distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or natural gas sales 
one of the primary purposes of decoupling is to eliminate the disincentive a utility otherwise has to encourage and promote energy conservation programs designed to reduce energy usage 
under the rdm  the company will recognize  in its consolidated statements of earnings from august  forward  distribution revenues for fitchburg based on established revenue targets 
the established revenue targets for the gas division may be subject to periodic adjustments to account for customer growth and special contracts  for which rdm does not apply 
the difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted amounts is recognized as increases or decreases in accrued revenue which form the basis for future reconciliation adjustments in periodically resetting rates for future cash recoveries from  or credits to  customers 
the company s other electric and natural gas distribution utilities are not subject to rdm 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes a provision for doubtful accounts each month based upon the company s experience in collecting electric and gas utility service accounts receivable in prior years 
at the end of each month  an analysis of the delinquent receivables is performed which takes into account an assumption about the cash recovery of delinquent receivables 
the analysis also calculates the amount of written off receivables that are recoverable through regulatory rate reconciling mechanisms 
the company s distribution utilities are authorized by regulators to recover the costs of their energy commodity portion of bad debts through rate mechanisms 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment about the assumptions used in the analysis  including expected fuel assistance payments from governmental authorities and the level of customers enrolling in payment plans with the company 
it has been the company s experience that the assumptions it has used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts have proven to be reasonably accurate 

table of contents retirement benefit obligations the company sponsors the unitil corporation retirement plan pension plan  which is a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the company also sponsors an unfunded retirement plan  the unitil corporation supplemental executive retirement plan serp  covering certain executives of the company  and an employee k savings plan 
additionally  the company sponsors the unitil employee health and welfare benefits plan pbop plan  primarily to provide health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees 
the fasb codification requires companies to record on their balance sheets as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of their retirement benefit obligations rbo based on the projected benefit obligation 
the company has recognized a corresponding regulatory asset  to recognize the future collection of these obligations in electric and gas rates 
the company s rbo and reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  future compensation  health care cost trends  and appropriate discount rates 
the company s rbo are affected by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also affect current and future costs 
if these assumptions were changed  the resultant change in benefit obligations  fair values of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit costs could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the discount rate assumptions used in determining retirement plan costs and retirement plan obligations are based on an assessment of current market conditions using high quality corporate bond interest rate indices and pension yield curves 
for the years ended december  and  a change in the discount rate of would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately  and  respectively  in the net periodic benefit cost for the pension plan 
for the years ended december  and  a increase in the assumption of health care cost trend rates would have resulted in increases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
similarly  a decrease in the assumption of health care cost trend rates for those same time periods would have resulted in decreases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company is subject to federal and state income taxes as well as various other business taxes 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax liabilities as well as assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from the timing of the deductions of expenses and recognition of taxable income for tax and book accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company accounts for income tax assets  liabilities and expenses in accordance with the fasb codification guidance on income taxes 
the company classifies penalty and interest expense related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense and interest expense  respectively  in the consolidated statements of earnings 
provisions for income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates for each period for which a statement of earnings is presented 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the fasb codification guidance on income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company s current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect its best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
periodically  the company assesses the realization of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and adjusts the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the revision become known 
depreciation depreciation expense is calculated on a group straight line basis based on the useful lives of assets and judgment is involved when estimating the useful lives of certain assets 
the company conducts independent depreciation studies on a periodic basis as part of the regulatory ratemaking process and considers the results presented in these studies in determining the useful lives of the company s fixed assets 
a change in the estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents commitments and contingencies the company s accounting policy is to record and or disclose commitments and contingencies in accordance with the fasb codification as it applies to an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
as of december   the company is not aware of any material commitments or contingencies other than those disclosed in the significant contractual obligations table in the contractual obligations section above and the commitments and contingencies footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements below 
refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards 
for further information regarding the foregoing matters  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes  note energy supply  note retirement benefit plans and note commitment and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk please also refer to item a 
risk factors 
interest rate risk as discussed above  unitil meets its external financing needs by issuing short term and long term debt 
the majority of debt outstanding represents long term notes bearing fixed rates of interest 
changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long term debt securities 
however  the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long term debt securities 
changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuances of long term debt securities 
in addition  short term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest 
as a result  changes in short term interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense in future periods 
for example  if the average amount of short term debt outstanding was million for the period of one year  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately  the average interest rate on short term borrowings was   and during   and  respectively 
market risk although unitil s three distribution utilities are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of electric power and natural gas supply costs in rates on a pass through basis 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
additionally  as discussed in the section entitled rates and regulation in part i  item business and in note commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company has divested its commodity related contracts and therefore  further reduced its exposure to commodity risk
