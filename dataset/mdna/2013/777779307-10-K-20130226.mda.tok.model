index to financial statements a breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the agreements governing our indebtedness  including the financial covenants in our credit facility  could result in a default under such indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the lenders under our credit facility could terminate their commitments to us  and they could accelerate the repayment of all of our indebtedness 
in such case  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the facilities  which is substantially all of our assets 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 
our exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful 
exploration and development activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive quantities of oil  ngls and natural gas will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors  including reductions in oil  ngl and natural gas prices  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  disruptions to production from producing wells related to hydraulic fracturing operations in nearby wells  interference between producing wells  as a result of  among other things  spacing between wells  equipment failures  including corrosion of aging equipment  systems failures and extended downtime  or accidents  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  lost or damaged oilfield development and services tools  limitations in midstream infrastructure or the lack of markets for oil  ngls and natural gas  unavailability or high cost of processing and transportation  human error  community unrest  sabotage  terrorism and border issues  including encounters with illegal aliens and drug smugglers  adverse weather conditions  including severe droughts resulting in new restrictions on water usage  environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations  possible federal  state  regional and municipal regulatory moratoriums on new permits  delays in securing new permits  changes to existing permitting requirements without grandfathering of existing permits and possible prohibition and limitations with regard to certain completion activities  and increases in severance taxes 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend  in part  on data obtained through geological and geophysical analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are uncertain 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying potentially productive hydrocarbon traps and geohazards 
they do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or economic 
in addition  the use of d 
table of contents 
index to financial statements seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
because of these factors  we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures 
poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
numerous uncertainties are inherent in our estimates of oil  ngl and natural gas reserves and our estimated reserve quantities  and our present value calculations may not be accurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by our engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers and geologists 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our engineers control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil  ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil  ngl and natural gas prices  expenditures for future development and exploration activities  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil  ngls and natural gas 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an average price  calculated as the twelve month first day of the month historical average price for the twelve month period prior to the end of the reporting period  and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our reserves as of december  were based on the trailing twelve month first day of the month historical unweighted averages of west texas intermediate oil prices  adjusted for basis and quality differentials  of per bbl and henry hub natural gas prices  adjusted for basis and quality differentials  of per mmbtu 
actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
the timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor that we use to calculate the standardized measure of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with the sec s rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry  in general  will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor in arriving at the standardized measure of future net cash flows 
downward revisions of reserves or lower oil and natural gas prices could result in impairments of our oil and natural gas properties 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation  on the amount of our oil and natural gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the cost ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down of our estimated net reserves to the extent of such excess 
if required  a write down would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgment 
the current ceiling calculation utilizes a trailing twelve month first day of the month historical unweighted average price and does not allow us to re evaluate the calculation subsequent to the end of the period if prices increase 
it also dictates that costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying 
table of contents 
index to financial statements value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  a write down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
it is possible that we may recognize revisions to our proved reserves in the future 
write downs recorded in one period will not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable in the subsequent period 
we have not recorded any write downs or impairments for the years ended december   or due to the volatility of commodity prices  however  should oil and natural gas prices decline in the future  it is possible that write downs could occur

changes in governmental laws  regulations  and rules could materially affect our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial position and future growth 
our activities are subject to federal  state  regional and local laws and regulations 
some of the laws  regulations and rules contain provisions for significant fines and penalties for non compliance 
changes in laws and regulations could affect our costs of operations  production levels  royalty obligations  price levels  environmental requirements  and other aspects of our business  including our general profitability 
we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations 
for example  the epa has recently focused on public concerns about the risk of water contamination and public health problems from drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities 
on august   the epa published final rules that extend new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to certain exploration and production operations 
this renewed focus could lead to additional federal and state regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry 
new regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations could materially affect our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial position and future growth 
our business requires a staff with technical expertise  specialized knowledge and training and a high degree of management experience 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and experience required for our business 
an inability to sufficiently staff our operations or the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with technical skills could have a negative effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and future growth 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil  ngl and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil  ngl and natural gas processing and transportation to available markets or the remote location of certain of our drilling operations may hinder our access to markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our various products depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil  ngls and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines  terminals and trucking  railroad and or barge transportation and processing facilities 
our ability to market our production also depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines  terminals  other means of transportation and processing facilities 
we may be required to shut in wells or delay production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of gathering systems  pipelines  or other means of transportation or processing facilities 
the transportation of our production may be interrupted under the terms of our interruptible or short term transportation agreements due to capacity constraints on the applicable system 
the transportation of our production may also be interrupted under the terms of our firm long term transportation  terminal and processing agreements due to operational upset  third party force majeure or other events beyond our control 
further  any disruption of third party facilities due to maintenance  repairs  debottlenecking  expansion projects  weather or other interruptions of service could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products 
our concentration of operations in the eagle 
table of contents 
index to financial statements ford area increases these risks and their potential impact upon us 
if we experience any interruptions to the transportation and or processing of our products  we may be unable to realize revenue from our wells until our production can be tied to a pipeline or gathering system  transported by truck  rail and or barge  or processed  as applicable  into the particular products 
this can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil  ngls and natural gas and ultimate realization of revenues 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil  ngls and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our competitors include major and large independent oil and natural gas companies that possess financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties at a lower cost and more quickly than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
our strategy as an onshore unconventional resource player has resulted in operations concentrated in one geographic area and increases our exposure to many of the risks enumerated herein 
currently our operations are highly concentrated in the eagle ford area 
as our largest producing area  this play provided approximately of our total revenue for  excluding the impact of derivative instruments  and represents nearly of our estimated total proved reserves as of december  this concentration increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform 
for example  we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting texas  natural disasters in the geographic area  competition for equipment  services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
if the level of exploration and production increases in the future  the demand for and costs of oilfield services could rise  while the quality of these services may decline 
if the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in the eagle ford area  we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in this area 
operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  
table of contents 
index to financial statements explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  hurricanes  tropical storms and flooding  pollution  releases of toxic gas  and surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives 
any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition or could result in a loss of our properties 
we are not fully insured against all risks  including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to sudden and accidental pollution  but not for other types of pollution 
our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities 
our energy package is written on reasonably standard terms and conditions that are generally available to the exploration and production industry 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
insurance costs could increase in the future as the insurance industry adjusts to difficult exposures and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur a liability for a risk at a time when we do not have liability insurance  then our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our current insurance policies provide some coverage for losses arising out of our hydraulic fracturing operations 
however  these policies may not cover fines  penalties or costs and expenses related to government mandated clean up activities  and total losses related to a spill  contamination or blowout during completion operations could exceed our per occurrence or aggregate policy limits 
furthermore  our current insurance policies do not provide coverage for ground water contamination due to any migration if not discoverable within a certain period  from fractured areas or from leaking associated with inadequate casing or cementing or defective and or inadequate pipe and or casing in the vertical sections of any of our shale wells that traverse aquifers in the locations of our producing properties 
any losses due to hydraulic fracturing that are not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
regulation and competition of hydraulic fracturing services could impede our ability to develop our shale plays 
hydraulic fracturing activities are required for all of our wells on our shale producing properties 
our shale properties are dependent on our ability to hydraulically fracture the producing formations 
commonly referred to as fracking  hydraulic fracturing is an integral part of the well completion process for all of our shale properties  including all of our exploration and development activities related to these properties 
the fracking process involves pumping fluid at high pressure into underground shale formations through steel pipe that is perforated at the location of the hydrocarbons 
the composition of the fluid is generally water and sand or a ceramic material called proppant and less than of highly diluted chemical additives  many of which are commonly found in household items 
the high pressure creates small fractures that allow the oil and natural gas to flow into the well bore for collection at the surface 
while the majority of the proppant remains wedged underground to prop open the fractures  a percentage of the water and additives flows back from 
table of contents 
index to financial statements hydraulic fracturing operations 
these fluids are then either recycled onsite or must be transported to and disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by applicable regulatory authorities 
the practice of hydraulic fracturing formations to stimulate production of oil and natural gas has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community 
various federal  state and local initiatives are underway to regulate  or further investigate  the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing 
for example  in  texas has adopted regulations requiring certain hydraulic fracturing disclosures 
although hydraulic fracturing has been largely exempt from the federal safe drinking water act since  bills have been considered in congress that would repeal this exemption 
in addition  the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices  and a number of federal agencies are analyzing environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing 
for example  the epa has commenced a multi year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing  the results of which are anticipated to be available in further  on may   the bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule that would require public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations  and impose other operational requirements for all hydraulic fracturing operations on federal lands  including native american trust lands 
the department of the interior announced on january  that the blm will issue a revised draft rule by march  the adoption of any future federal  state or local laws or regulations imposing additional permitting  disclosure or regulatory obligations related to  or otherwise restricting or increasing costs regarding the use of  hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult to conduct drilling activity 
as a result  such additional regulations could affect the volume of hydrocarbons we recover  and could increase the cycle times and costs to receive permits  delay or possibly preclude receipt of permits in certain areas  impact water usage and waste water disposal and require air emissions  water usage and chemical additives disclosures 
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the proposed legislation and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing  any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and  if the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited or prohibited  could lead to our inability to access existing and new oil  ngl and natural gas reserves in the future 
our industry is experiencing a growing emphasis on the exploitation and development of shale resource plays which are dependent on hydraulic fracturing for economically successful development 
we engage third party contractors to provide hydraulic fracturing services and related services  equipment and supplies 
the availability or high cost of high pressure pumping services or hydraulic fracturing services  chemicals  proppant  water  and related services and equipment could limit our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
hydraulic fracturing in shale plays requires high pressure pumping service crews 
a shortage of service crews or proppant  chemicals or water could materially and adversely affect our operations and the timeliness of executing our development plans within our budget 
hydraulic fracturing operations can result in air emissions  surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination  or ground water contamination by reason of well design and or construction  and a blowout during completion operations when hydraulic services are being provided could result in personal injury or death and loss or damage to property 
additionally  pre existing or concurrent non company spillage  contamination or property damage could result in litigation  government fines and penalties or remediation or restoration obligations  and damages 
environmental matters and costs can be significant 
the oil and natural gas business is subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
such laws and regulations may impose liability on us for pollution clean up  remediation  restoration and other liabilities arising from or related to our operations 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil 
table of contents 
index to financial statements or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production 
we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
the cost of future compliance is uncertain and is subject to various factors  including future changes to laws and regulations 
we have no assurance that future changes in or additions to the environmental laws and regulations will not have a significant impact on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and future growth 
possible regulations related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil  ngls and natural gas 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a byproduct of the burning of refined oil products and natural gas  are examples of greenhouse gases 
in recent years  the us congress has considered climate related legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
in addition  at least states have developed measures to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
the epa has adopted regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities and is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the existing federal clean air act 
in november  the epa adopted rules expanding the industries subject to greenhouse gas reporting to include certain petroleum and natural gas facilities 
these rules required data collection beginning in and reporting beginning in  with annual reporting thereafter if emissions exceed  tons per year of coe although our emissions did not exceed this threshold in and our emissions data collection is in progress  some of our facilities may be subject to these rules in the future 
passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various states  or the adoption of other regulations by the epa or analogous state agencies  that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane or carbon dioxide in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas 
our property acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make property acquisitions and or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy includes acquiring oil and natural gas properties 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  ability or impediments to conducting thorough due diligence activities  potential lack of operating experience in the geographic market where the acquired properties are located  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements  the validity of our assumptions about reserves  future production  revenues  capital expenditures and operating costs  including synergies  a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our credit facility to finance acquisitions  a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  the assumption of unknown liabilities  losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the incurrence of other significant charges  such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties  asset devaluation or restructuring charges  and the inability to transition and integrate successfully or timely the businesses and or assets we acquire 
our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies  geophysical and geological analyses  environmental compliance review and seismic and other information  the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations 
also  our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully access their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as groundwater contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
derivative transactions may limit our potential revenue or result in financial losses which would reduce our income 
we have entered into oil  ngl and natural gas price derivative contracts with respect to a portion of our expected production through these derivative contracts may limit our potential revenue if oil  ngl and natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the contract 
such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative contract  or the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform under the contracts 
our current derivative instruments are with counterparties that are lenders under our credit facility or were lenders under our credit facility upon origination of the derivative instrument 
a default by any of our counterparties could negatively impact our financial performance 
the adoption of the dodd frank act could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business  resulting in our operations becoming more volatile and our cash flows less predictable 
congress has adopted the dodd frank act  a comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market 
the legislation was signed into law by president obama in and requires the cftc  the sec and other regulators to promulgate regulations implementing the new legislation 
while certain regulations are already in effect  the implementation process is still ongoing  and we cannot yet predict the ultimate effect of the regulations on our business 
the dodd frank act expanded the types of entities that are required to register with the cftc and the sec as a result of their activities in the derivatives markets or otherwise become specifically qualified to enter into derivatives contracts 
we will be required to assess our activities in the derivatives markets  and to monitor such activities on an ongoing basis  to identify any potential change in our regulatory status 
reporting and recordkeeping requirements also could significantly increase operating costs and expose us to penalties for non compliance 
certain cftc recordkeeping and reporting requirements are already effective  and additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements will be phased in through april these additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements may require additional compliance resources and may also have a negative effect on market liquidity  which could negatively impact commodity prices and our ability to hedge our commercial price risk 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the cftc has also issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures  options  and swap contracts in the major energy markets 
a united states district court recently vacated and remanded the position limits rules to the cftc 
the cftc has appealed that ruling and it is uncertain at this time whether  when  and to what extent the cftc s position limits rules will become effective 
the new regulations may also require us to comply with certain margin requirements for our over the counter derivative contracts with certain regulated entities  which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to use derivatives to hedge our risks  however  the proposed margin rules are not yet final and therefore the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time 
the financial reform legislation may also require our counterparties to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which entity may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
the new legislation also requires that certain derivative instruments be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform  which may result in increased costs in the form of additional margin requirements imposed by clearing organizations 
on december   the cftc published final rules regarding mandatory clearing of certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps and setting compliance dates for different categories of market participants  the earliest of which is march  the cftc has not yet proposed any rules requiring the clearing of any other classes of swaps 
although there may be an exception to the mandatory exchange trading and clearing requirement that applies to our trading activities  we must obtain approval from our board of directors and make certain filings in order to rely on this exception 
in addition  mandatory clearing requirements applicable to other market participants  such as swap dealers  may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for our commercial hedging program 
rules promulgated under the dodd frank act further defined forward contracts as well as instances where forwards may become swaps 
because guidance regarding forwards is still developing  it is possible that some arrangements that previously qualified as forwards or energy service contracts may fall within the regulatory category of swaps 
in addition  the cftc s rules applicable to trade options may further impose burdens on our ability to conduct our traditional hedging operations 
the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through restrictions on the types of collateral we are required to post  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 
finally  if we fail to comply with applicable laws  rules or regulations  we may be subject to fines  cease and desist orders  civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions 
the impairment of financial institutions or counterparty credit default could adversely affect us 
our commodity derivative transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparties 
deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us 
we may have significant exposure to our derivative counterparties and the value of our derivative positions may provide a significant amount of cash flow 
in addition  if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment  our liquidity may be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our credit facility 
currently  no single lender in our credit facility has commitments representing more than of our total commitments 
however  if banks continue to consolidate  we may experience a more concentrated credit risk 

table of contents 
index to financial statements certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
among the changes contained in the president s fiscal year budget proposal  released by the white house on february   is the elimination of certain us federal income tax deductions and credits currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
such proposed changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain us production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
recently  members of the us congress have considered  and in some cases proposed  similar changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
it is unclear  however  whether any such changes will be enacted or  if enacted  how soon such changes would be effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposal or any other similar change in us federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion addresses material changes in our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and material changes in our financial condition since december  results for full year include the following production of mmboe compared to mmboe for the year ended december   gross net wells drilled with a success rate compared to gross net wells drilled with a success rate for the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our principal business strategy is focused on the acquisition  development and production of oil  ngls and natural gas from unconventional resource plays 
our current assets are primarily located in the eagle ford area in south texas  one of the most active plays in the us in the last three years  we have become a significant producer in the liquids rich window of the region and have established an inventory of lower risk  higher return drilling opportunities that offer more predictable and long term production  reserve growth and a more valuable commodity mix 
in addition to our focus in the eagle ford area  we are pursuing new opportunities to drive the long term growth and sustainability of the company 
we continue to evaluate investments in other unconventional resource basins that offer a viable inventory of projects including new higher risk exploration projects and producing property acquisitions 
we believe we have the financial and operational flexibility to react quickly should such attractive opportunities that fit our profile be presented 
our current operations in the eagle ford area are focused in four areas 
our original discovery is located in the  acre gates ranch leasehold in webb county 
we are also active in the karnes trough area  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the briscoe ranch leasehold and in central dimmit county  where our positions were delineated in and overall  as of december  we hold  net acres in the region with approximately  acres located in the crude oil and liquids producing portions of the play 
we were an early entrant into the eagle ford area  accumulating most of our acreage positions during and when the trend was still in its infancy as an unconventional resource play 
the development of our assets in the eagle ford has led to substantial growth for the company 
during  we recorded a increase in daily production  with total liquids production growth of and total proved reserves growth of from as of december   our total estimated proved reserves were mmboe as compared to mmboe at the prior year end 
of our total reserves  approximately were liquids and were classified as proved developed 
approximately of our production during was attributable to crude oil and ngls and of our total liquids production was attributable to oil 
this compares to of our production being attributable to crude oil and ngls and of our total liquids production being attributable to oil in we replaced of production from all sources at a reserve replacement cost of per boe 
we successfully drilled gross wells and completed gross wells during of those wells  were drilled and were completed in the eagle ford area 
as of december   we had completed a total of gross wells in the eagle ford area 
during  we continued to record strong sequential growth in eagle ford volumes  averaging a record mboe d in the fourth quarter  a increase from the same period in and a increase from the prior quarter 
to handle the increased demand  we have secured multiple options for transportation and processing capacity with firm commitments in place to meet total planned production levels through  and we have begun the process of securing additional firm capacity 
the development of our eagle ford assets combined with the sale of non strategic assets continued to lower our overall cost structure as a company  with direct lease operating expenses for full year decreasing to per boe from per boe for the same period in we also benefited from a decline in drilling and completion costs in the eagle ford area during the latter part of the year due to more favorable contractual terms that were the result of increased availability of services and materials and improvements in well completion design 
projected drilling and completion costs dropped in some areas by million per well since our announcement of our capital program in december with our shift to an unconventional resource strategy  we have streamlined our operations by divesting of assets that no longer fit our operating model 
since  we have executed sale agreements for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
during  we sold our lobo assets and a portion of our olmos properties in south texas for million  subject to customary closing adjustments  with a january  effective date 
during the second quarter of  our exploratory drilling program in the southern alberta basin in northwest montana was concluded 
of the seven horizontal wells that were drilled  five were completed 
based on results that were not economic  we have suspended all capital activity for exploration in the area 
our southern alberta basin leases and lease options will begin to expire in january our capital program is expected to range from million to million  as compared to our original million capital budget 
we announced that approximately of our capital program is budgeted for the evaluation of new venture opportunities inside as well as outside of the eagle ford area 
our announced capital program is based on an average five rig program and includes the drilling of wells along with the completion of eagle ford wells 
approximately half of the completions will be located in the gates ranch area with the remainder in other areas in the liquids rich window of the play  including the karnes trough area  briscoe ranch and central dimmit county 
since the announcement of our capital program  we have experienced reduced drilling and completion costs which we expect will provide greater flexibility in our capital expenditures 

table of contents 
index to financial statements while our unconventional resource strategy is proving to be successful  we recognize that there are risks inherent to our industry that could impact our ability to meet future goals 
although we cannot completely control all external factors that could affect our operating environment  our business model takes into account the threats that could impede achievement of our stated growth objectives and the building of our asset base 
we have diversified our production base to include a greater mix of crude oil and ngls  which continue to be priced at more favorable levels than natural gas 
with our high concentration of production located in the eagle ford area  we have taken various steps to provide access to necessary services and infrastructure 
we believe our capital program can be executed from internally generated cash flow supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility 
we continuously monitor our liquidity to respond to changing market conditions  commodity prices and service costs 
if our internal funds are insufficient to meet projected funding requirements  we would consider curtailing capital spending or accessing the capital markets 
availability under our credit facility is restricted to a borrowing base and committed amount  which is subject to review and adjustment on a semi annual basis and other interim adjustments  including adjustments based on hedging arrangements and asset divestitures 
the amount of the borrowing base and committed amount is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of reserves  as well as the pricing outlook at the time of the redetermination 
as of december   our borrowing base and committed amount under our credit facility was million 
as of february   we had million of borrowings outstanding with million available for borrowing 
financial highlights our consolidated financial statements reflect total revenue of million based on total volumes of mmboe and derivative gains of million for significant transactions which affect the comparability of our financial results between periods include the divestiture of our lobo assets and a portion of our olmos assets  the divestitures of our sacramento basin and dj basin assets and the divestitures of our pinedale  san juan  arklatex  and gulf coast sabine lake assets

the increase in natural gas production of in from was primarily attributable to our gates ranch wells in the eagle ford area  whose total natural gas production in  and was mmcf per day  mmcf per day and mmcf per day  respectively 
the decrease in natural gas production of in from was primarily due to asset divestitures of our former gas based assets  the suspension of drilling programs in areas that produce primarily from dry gas reservoirs and the natural decline of gas based properties

derivative instruments 
in  derivative instruments include realized and unrealized derivative gains of million and million  respectively 
realized derivative gains represent cash settlements associated with our commodity derivative contracts  while unrealized derivative gains represent changes in fair value on commodity derivative contracts and the reclassification of commodity hedging gains from accumulated other comprehensive income 
in  derivative instruments included an unrealized derivative gain of million associated with the change in fair value of our crude oil basis and nymex roll swaps 
these instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting in  the last year in which we elected hedge accounting  and the associated derivative gain has been reclassified from oil sales to derivative instruments to conform to our current year presentation

lease operating expense 
lease operating expense increased in from primarily due to our completion of wells in the eagle ford area in as of december   we had completed a total of gross eagle ford area wells 
lease operating expense decreased in primarily due to our divestitures of our sacramento basin assets in california and our dj basin assets in colorado  as well as our overall lease operating expense reduction efforts 
treating and transportation 
treating and transportation expense increased year over year as a result of increased daily production of and  respectively  from and in the eagle ford area as well as higher unit costs required to transport incremental production from the area 
in addition  we accrued deficiency fees of million in related to shortfalls in delivering the minimum volumes required under our transportation and processing agreements during production taxes 
production taxes are highly correlated to commodity revenues  production volumes and commodity prices  which have impacted this expense item 
production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales  excluding derivative instruments  were  and for  and  respectively  and are reflective of certain production tax incentives 
the increase in rate from was primarily due to a higher percentage of our oil revenues being subject to taxation in the state of texas

in  general and administrative costs  net of capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million  increased from the increase in was primarily related to a million increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of our increased stock price and incentive compensation related to performance share units  a million increase in consultant costs related to various internal projects and divestiture activities  and a million increase in other administrative costs  partially offset by a decrease of million in salaries  wages and bonuses due to lower headcount as a result of closing our former denver office 
total other expense total other expense includes interest expense  net of interest capitalized  interest income and other income expense  net 
total other expense increased million in from primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility 
total other expense decreased million in from primarily due to our repayment of million under the credit facility in april  which resulted in lower interest expense and an increase in capitalized interest resulting from an increase in our weighted average interest rate 
the weighted average interest rate of in was higher than the rate of due to the higher interest rate associated with the senior notes  which were issued in april provision for income taxes our income tax expense was million 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was compared to the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes differs from the taxes computed at the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effect of state taxes  the non deductibility of certain incentive compensation and a valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets 
the company provides for deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax liability of million  compared to a net deferred tax asset of approximately million at december   resulting primarily from the difference between the book and tax bases of our oil and natural gas properties and net operating loss carryforwards nols 
in connection with our asset divestitures in  and  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the nols and other deferred tax assets in those states impacted by our divestitures would not be realized 
therefore  valuation allowances were established for these items as well as state nols in other jurisdictions in which we previously operated but had since divested of operating assets 
annually  changes in our valuation allowance are made to reflect revised estimates of the utilization of state deferred tax assets 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considering all available evidence obtained in future reporting periods 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity and capital is our operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility  which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow 

table of contents 
index to financial statements operating cash flow 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil  ngls and natural gas and the success of our development and exploration activities 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by executing derivative transactions to hedge the change in prices of a portion of our production  thereby mitigating our exposure to price declines  but these transactions may also limit our earnings potential in periods of rising commodity prices 
the effects of these derivative transactions on our oil  ngl and natural gas sales are discussed above under results of operations revenues 
the majority of our capital expenditures are discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows decline from expected levels 
economic conditions and lower commodity prices could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 
we will continue to monitor our cash flow and liquidity and  if appropriate  we may consider adjusting our capital expenditure program or raising additional debt or equity capital 
senior secured revolving credit facility 
on april   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility 
under this amendment  among other things  our borrowing base and commitments were increased from million to million and our capacity to hedge our production was increased 
availability under the credit facility is restricted to a borrowing base and committed amount  which are subject to review and adjustment on a semi annual basis and other interim adjustments  including adjustments based on our hedging arrangements as well as asset divestitures 
the amount of the borrowing base and committed amount is affected by a number of factors  including our level of reserves  as well as the pricing outlook at the time of the redetermination 
therefore  a significant reduction in capital spending may result in a reduced level of reserves that could lower our borrowing base and committed amount 
as of december   we had million outstanding with million of available borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at specified margins over the london interbank offered rate libor of to and mature in may the weighted average borrowing rate for the year ended december  under the credit facility was 
borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets  including a mortgage lien on oil and natural gas properties having at least of the pre tax sec pv proved reserve value  a guaranty by all of our domestic subsidiaries  and a pledge of of the membership and limited partnership interests of our domestic subsidiaries 
collateralized amounts under the mortgages are subject to semi annual reviews based on updated reserve information 
we are also subject to certain financial covenants  including the requirement to maintain i a minimum current ratio of consolidated current assets  including the unused amount of available borrowing capacity  to consolidated current liabilities  excluding certain non cash obligations  of not less than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter and ii a maximum leverage ratio of total debt to earnings before interest expense  income taxes and noncash items  such as depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment  of not greater than to  calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended  after giving pro forma effect to acquisitions and divestitures 
at december   our current ratio as defined under the agreement was and our leverage ratio was in addition  we are subject to covenants limiting dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  changes of control  asset sales  and liens on properties 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  in early  we borrowed an additional million under the credit facility and our borrowing capacity was reduced to million

in connection with the prepayment of the restated term loan  million of prepayment fees were incurred and have been reflected as a component of interest expense 
senior notes 
on april   we issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in a private offering 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture the indenture with wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
provisions of the indenture limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or purchase

at december   we were in compliance with the terms and provisions as contained within the indenture 
proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to repay million outstanding under our credit facility and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding under our restated term loan  and to pay fees and expenses associated with the offering

commodity price risk and related derivative activities the energy markets have historically been very volatile and oil  ngl and natural gas prices will be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices  management hedges oil  ngl and natural gas prices from time to time  primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments  including fixed price swaps  basis swaps  nymex roll swaps  costless collars and put options 
although not risk free  we believe these activities will reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and thereby enable us to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
consistent with this policy  we have entered into a series of oil  ngl and natural gas fixed price swaps  basis swaps  nymex roll swaps and costless collars for each year through our fixed price swap  basis swap  nymex roll swap and costless collar agreements require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a notional quantity of oil  ngls and natural gas  as applicable  without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments were based on a portion of our expected production from existing wells upon inception of the derivative instruments 
as of december   our derivative instruments are with counterparties who are lenders under our credit facility or were lenders under our credit facility upon origination of the derivative instrument 
this practice allows us to satisfy any need for any margin obligation resulting from an adverse change in the fair market value of the derivative contracts with the collateral securing our credit facility  thus eliminating the need for independent collateral postings 
as of december   we had no deposits for collateral in regard to our commodity derivative instruments 
capital requirements our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including capitalized internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities of million and capitalized interest of million 
we have plans to execute a capital program in of million to million that will be funded from internally generated cash flows supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility 
commitments and contingencies as is common within the oil and natural gas industry  we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved oil and natural gas properties 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
