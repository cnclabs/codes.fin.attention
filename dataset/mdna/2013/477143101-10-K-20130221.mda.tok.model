we generated million in cash from operations while strengthening our balance sheet with increased lines of credit and reductions to our overall debt balance 
we expanded our portfolio of commercial airline partnerships  adding eight new airline partnerships during the year  bringing our total to airline partnerships as of december  we further solidified our position as new york hometown airline with the opening of our new headquarters in long island city and as we commenced construction of an international arrivals facility at john f 
kennedy international airport  or jfk

in addition  our commitment to deliver increased returns for our shareholders remains at the core of our overall business strategy 
we believe our continued focus on financial discipline  product innovation and network enhancements  combined with our service excellence  will drive our future success 
some of our major initiatives are described below 
strengthening of our balance sheet throughout  we were focused on strengthening our balance sheet 
we believe we made significant progress in doing so  and we remain committed to further improving our balance sheet 
we ended the year with unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at approximately of trailing twelve months revenue 
during  we prudently used cash to invest in our business while maintaining a solid liquidity profile 
throughout the year  we reduced our overall debt balance by million while increasing our total property and equipment by nearly 
our investments also included capital spending for slot acquisitions  our international arrival facility at jfk and aircraft prepayments 
we believe spending wisely now will generate future returns  through balance sheet improvements and  ultimately  by helping us maintain the flexibility to be able to take advantage of future growth opportunities 
additionally  in september  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million shares over a five year period 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million 
airport infrastructure investments during  we made significant airport infrastructure enhancements in several of our focus cities 
in san juan  we moved into a larger space in the all new terminal a at luis mu oz marin international airport 
in boston  we opened a newly renovated hangar to support our growing operations 
in new york  we commenced construction of a new international arrival extension to our existing terminal at jfk 
the creation of a new dedicated site to handle us customs and border protection checks at terminal will eliminate the need for our international customers to arrive at an often slow terminal in long beach  we moved into our own concourse in the newly modernized terminal facility 
network initiatives we continue to make network adjustments in furtherance of our overall network growth plans 
our network focus over the past several years has primarily been on boston and the caribbean and latin america 
we feel there remains opportunity to grow our revenue in these regions due to our differentiated product offerings 
in boston  for example  with our product and network enhancements  we have been able to better accommodate business customers which has helped us to build revenue momentum from corporate share gains 
throughout  we continued to improve our relevance to business customers in boston 
we offer non stop service to more destinations from boston logan international airport than any other carrier at boston 
east coast short haul markets in boston were the best performing region in our network during  as measured by year over year unit revenue growth  even while we added significant capacity 
our growth in the caribbean and latin america also continued in  we now have approximately of our capacity in this important region 
we remain focused on growing our network and further reducing seasonality by targeting new customers  including leisure travelers  business travelers  visiting friends and relatives  or vfr  traffic and international airline partners 
new service as part of our ongoing network initiatives and route optimization efforts  we continued to make schedule and frequency adjustments throughout in boston  particularly  we did so to better accommodate business customers and increase our relevance 
during  we commenced service to five new destinations dallas fort worth  texas  cartagena  colombia  samana  dominican republic  grand cayman  cayman islands and providence  rhode island 
additionally  we have announced plans to begin service to the following destinations in charleston  south carolina  albuquerque  new mexico  philadelphia  pennsylvania and medellin  colombia 
our growth includes adding new routes between existing cities 
our commitment to profitable growth also resulted in the discontinuation of certain routes and reduced service in our network throughout ancillary revenue initiatives our ancillary revenue initiatives are focused on increasing high margin revenue streams 
our evenmore product continued to be successful throughout we reconfigured our embraer fleet  converting eight seats per aircraft to evenmore space seats 
additionally  we began selling evenmore speed  our expedited security option  on a standalone basis in most of our us domestic locations 
during  we introduced a new badge to our trueblue frequent flyer program called mosaic  which is designed to recognize and reward our most loyal customers 
the program enhancements include early boarding and a free second checked bag  among many others 
we also launched a new co branded credit card exclusively for residents of puerto rico  where we are the largest carrier  which will allow residents to enjoy the full benefits of our trueblue loyalty program 
outlook for as we enter  we believe we are well positioned to build upon our performance 
we aim to deliver improved year over year margins and increased returns for our shareholders 
our plan aims to achieve these goals and assumes we are able to maintain our competitive cost advantage and build upon our high value network 
we plan to introduce new service as well as expand our portfolio of commercial airline partnerships during we continuously look to expand our other ancillary revenue opportunities  including our evenmore product offering and improving our trueblue loyalty program 
we also remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and prudently investing in infrastructure and product enhancements to enable us to reap future benefits 
for the full year  we estimate our operating capacity to increase approximately to over with the net addition of three airbus a aircraft and seven embraer aircraft to our operating fleet 
we will also take delivery of our first four airbus a aircraft in the latter part of the entry into service date of the airbus a will depend on the timing and successful completion of the faa certification process 
assuming fuel prices of per gallon  net of our fuel hedging activity  our cost per available seat mile for is expected to increase by to over this expected increase is primarily a result of continued maintenance cost pressures associated with the aging of our fleet 
additionally  salaries  wages and benefits are expected to increase due to the increasing tenure of our crewmembers combined with efforts to maintain competitiveness of our compensation packages 
results of operations year compared to year we reported net income of million in compared to net income of million in in  we had operating income of million  an increase of million over  and an operating margin of  up points from diluted earnings per share were for compared to diluted earnings per share of for during  despite uncertain economic conditions  a severe hurricane hitting the core of our operations and the persistent competitiveness of the airline industry  we managed to produce solid financial results 
we generated consistent unit revenue growth throughout the year by continuing to manage the structure and mix of our network 
we further complemented our historically leisure focused travel markets with higher yielding business markets 
our efforts to capitalize on key growth regions were primarily focused in boston and the caribbean region  which resulted in increased capacity during our on time performance  defined by the dot as arrivals within minutes of schedule  was in compared to in while improved in  our on time performance throughout the year and on a year over year basis remained challenged by our concentration of operations in the northeast united states  which contains some of the most congested and delay prone airports in the us vs 
highlights during the fourth quarter of  hurricane sandy directly and significantly impacted our operations  closing many east coast airports for several days 
we canceled approximately  flights over a six day period 
operating capacity increased approximately to billion available seat miles in average fares for the year increased to  which also resulted in an increase of million in associated credit card fees 
operating expenses per available seat mile increased to cents 
excluding fuel  our cost per available seat mile increased in invested in four new owned embraer aircraft and seven new owned airbus a aircraft 
eight of these aircraft were debt financed 
commenced service to five new cities during total departures increased 
extended the leases on three aircraft during at lower rates 
the average age of our fleet increased to years  and as of december   our oldest operating aircraft had an age of years 
early extinguishment of approximately million in principal of long term debt resulted in a net of million in losses recorded in interest income and other 
operating revenues revenues in millions year over year change passenger revenue other revenue operating revenues average fare yield per passenger mile cents passenger revenue per asm cents operating revenue per asm cents average stage length miles revenue passengers thousands revenue passenger miles millions available seat miles asms load factor pts we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue accounted for of our total operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes  including puerto rico  accounted for of our total passenger revenues in revenue is recognized either when transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles  which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 
we attempt to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher revenue per available seat mile  or rasm 
our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our customers with competitive fares 
passenger revenue also includes revenue from our evenmore space ancillary product offering 
in  the increase in passenger revenues was mainly attributable to the increased capacity and increase in yield 
our evenmore space seats continued to be a significant ancillary product  generating approximately million in revenue  an increase of approximately over primarily as a result of additional evenmore space seats on our embraer fleet  increased capacity and revised pricing 
other revenue consists primarily of fees charged to customers in accordance with our published policies 
these include reservation changes and baggage limitations  evenmore speed expedited security  the marketing component of trueblue point sales  concession revenues  revenues associated with transporting mail and cargo  revenues associated with the ground handling of other airlines and rental income 
revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems on other airlines are also included in other revenue 
other revenue increased primarily as a result of an million increase in revenues from certain passenger related fees such as change fees and excess baggage 
these increased fees were slightly offset by a million guarantee recorded in related to our co branded credit card 
operating expenses dollars in millions year over year change per asm change aircraft fuel and related taxes salaries  wages and benefits landing fees and other rents depreciation and amortization aircraft rent sales and marketing maintenance materials and repairs other operating expenses total operating expenses aircraft fuel and hedging the price and availability of aircraft fuel are extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors we can neither control nor accurately predict 
during fuel prices remained volatile  increasing over average prices 
we maintain a diversified fuel hedge portfolio by entering into a variety of fuel hedge contracts in order to provide some protection against sharp and sudden volatility and further increases in fuel prices 
in total  we hedged of our total fuel consumption 
we also use fixed forward price agreements  or ffps  which allow us to lock in a price for fixed quantities of fuel to be delivered at a specified date in the future  to manage fuel price volatility 
as of december   we had outstanding fuel hedge contracts covering approximately of our forecasted consumption for the first quarter of and for the full year as of december   we had of our fuel consumption requirements covered under ffps 
in january and february  we entered into jet fuel swap and cap agreements covering an additional of our forecasted consumption 
we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and intend to take advantage of reasonable fuel hedging opportunities as they become available 
aircraft fuel expense represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
the increase in year over year average fuel cost per gallon resulted in million of higher fuel expense 
additionally  we consumed million more gallons of aircraft fuel  resulting in million of higher fuel expense 
based on our expected fuel volume for  a per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately million 
during  we recorded million in effective fuel hedge gains which offset fuel expense  this compares to million in fuel derivatives not qualifying as cash flow hedges in resulted in approximately million in losses recorded in interest income and other  compared to an insignificant amount in accounting ineffectiveness on fuel derivatives classified as cash flow hedges resulted in insignificant losses in and million in  recorded in interest income and other 
we are unable to predict what the amount of ineffectiveness will be related to these instruments  or the potential loss of hedge accounting which is determined on a derivative by derivative basis  due to the volatility in the forward markets for these commodities 
salaries  wages and benefits the increasing tenure of our crewmembers  rising healthcare costs and efforts to maintain competitiveness in our overall compensation packages are presenting cost pressures 
in an attempt to proactively manage future increases in healthcare costs as a result of new healthcare reform legislation and impending tax increases  we comprehensively re designed our healthcare plans 
during  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased by resulting in an increase to salaries  wages and benefits 
the average tenure of our crewmembers increased to years as of december  resulting in an increase to average wages and benefits per full time equivalent employees 
as a result of increased wages  our guaranteed retirement contribution  which we refer to as retirement plus  to all of our eligible crewmembers increased by million 
our increased profitability resulted in million of profit sharing expense to be paid to our crewmembers in march during  we also introduced a retirement advantage program  providing an additional retirement contribution for certain of our faa licensed crewmembers  which resulted in million of increased expense 
maintenance materials and repairs maintenance materials and repairs are generally expensed when incurred unless covered by a long term flight hour services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft of years is relatively young  all of our aircraft currently require less maintenance than the fleet of many of our competitors 
as our fleet ages  our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as older aircraft require additional  more expensive repairs over time 
in addition to the increase in operating aircraft and the aging of our fleet  several aircraft coming off of warranty contributed to higher maintenance costs in additionally  one of our key engine and component repair maintenance providers liquidated during the first quarter of we believe the overall impact of the liquidation was approximately million in more costly repairs while we found alternative providers 
during the third and fourth quarter of  we engaged new maintenance providers to replace the liquidated provider 
these new maintenance providers will provide similar services at competitive rates 
we are also working on a long term maintenance agreement for our embraer aircraft components  which are currently not covered under a maintenance agreement 
we believe expanding the scope of our maintenance services covered under long term agreements will help us to better manage and predict maintenance costs over time 
we are continuously exploring opportunities to mitigate and level the increase in maintenance expense  including by improving operational efficiencies 
we also continue to work with our various maintenance repair partners and manufacturers  most recently we entered into an agreement to mitigate the risk of cost overruns associated with our embraer heavy maintenance checks 
we expect the rate of increase in maintenance expense to lessen in the next few years as the heavy maintenance hurdle from our mid aircraft deliveries subsides and we benefit from new maintenance agreements for both our a and e fleets 
other operating expenses other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  cost of goods sold to other airlines by livetv  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes 
during  we had several non recurring items impacting other operating expenses 
livetv terminated a customer contract resulting in a gain of approximately million 
we sold two embraer aircraft and six spare aircraft engines resulting in a gain of approximately million 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and the non deductibility of certain items for tax purposes as well as the relative size of these items to our pre tax income of million and our pre tax income of million 
the rate decrease was attributable to reductions in certain non deductible items and the relative size of these items to our pre tax income 
year compared to year we reported net income of million in compared to net income of million in in  we had operating income of million  a decrease of million over  and an operating margin of  down points from diluted earnings per share were for compared to diluted earnings per share of for we generated consistent unit revenue growth throughout the year by managing our network and balancing the seasonality created by our highly leisure focused business 
we complemented our leisure travel markets with higher yielding business markets and capitalized on key growth regions  primarily boston and the caribbean  which resulted in increased capacity 
our on time performance  defined by the dot as arrivals within minutes of schedule  was in compared to in our on time performance throughout the year and on a year over year basis remained challenged by our significant operations in the northeast united states 
vs highlights during the first quarter of  the winter storm season was extremely severe 
the operational impact of the severe storm season pressured our casm  excluding fuel  and negatively impacted our completion factor 
during the third quarter of  hurricane irene severely impacted our operations as its path travelled directly through the core of our network 
flights were suspended in new york and boston  resulting in approximately cancellations over a three day period 
operating capacity increased approximately to billion available seat miles in average fares for the year increased over to  which also resulted in an increase of million in associated credit card fees 
operating expenses per available seat mile increased to cents 
excluding fuel  our cost per available seat mile increased in invested in five new owned embraer aircraft and four new owned airbus a aircraft  all of which were debt financed 
opened seven new cities in total departures increased 
extended the leases on four aircraft during at lower rates 
the average age of our fleet increased to years  and as of december   our oldest operating aircraft had an age of years 
in  we had several items impacting other operating expenses which did not recur in we incurred approximately million in one time implementation expenses related to our new customer service system 
we recorded a million one time impairment expense related to the intangible assets and other costs associated with developing an air to ground connectivity capability 
we paid a million rescheduling fee in connection with the deferral of aircraft 
early extinguishment of million par value of our series a convertible debt due resulted in million in losses recorded in interest income and other 
operating revenues revenues in millions year over year change passenger revenue other revenue operating revenues average fare yield per passenger mile cents passenger revenue per asm cents operating revenue per asm cents average stage length miles revenue passengers thousands revenue passenger miles millions available seat miles asms load factor pts passenger revenues increased mainly attributable to the capacity increase along with the increase in yield 
revenue from our even more space seats increased million as a result of increased capacity and revised pricing 
other revenue increased as a result of a million increase in marketing related revenues as well as an million increase in revenues from certain passenger related fees such as change fees and excess baggage 
livetv third party revenues increased approximately million 
operating expenses dollars in millions year over year change per asm change aircraft fuel and related taxes salaries  wages and benefits landing fees and other rents depreciation and amortization aircraft rent sales and marketing maintenance materials and repairs other operating expenses total operating expenses aircraft fuel and hedging aircraft fuel expense increased  and represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
average fuel cost per gallon increased to compared to in  resulting in million of higher fuel expense 
additionally  we consumed million more gallons of aircraft fuel  resulting in million of higher fuel expense 
we hedged approximately of our total fuel consumption 
we recorded million in effective fuel hedge gains  which offset fuel expense  versus million in effective fuel hedge losses during  which were an increase to fuel expense 
accounting ineffectiveness on fuel derivatives classified as cash flow hedges resulted in losses of million in each of and  recorded in interest income and other 
we are unable to predict what the amount of ineffectiveness will be related to these instruments  or the potential loss of hedge accounting which is determined on a derivative by derivative basis  due to the volatility in the forward markets for these commodities 
salaries  wages and benefits the increase in salaries  wages and benefits was primarily due to a increase in the number of average number of full time equivalent employees needed to support our profitable growth plans 
the increasing seniority levels of our crewmembers combined with pay and benefit increases also contributed to higher expense 
maintenance materials and repairs maintenance expense represented a significant cost challenge in  increasing million 
in addition to the additional operating aircraft and the aging of our fleet  several aircraft coming off of warranty contributed to higher maintenance costs 
maintenance expense is expected to increase significantly as our fleet ages  as older aircraft need additional  more expensive repairs over time 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes  the change in valuation allowance and the non deductibility of certain items for tax purposes and the relative size of these items to our pre tax income of million and our pre tax income of million 
the rate increase was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance attributable to state net operating loss carryforwards in costs per available seat mile non gaap our costs per available seat mile  or casm  a common metric used in the airline industry  are summarized in the table below 
we have listed separately our fuel costs and profit sharing expense 
while these amounts are included in casm  we believe excluding fuel costs  which are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control  as well as profit sharing  which is sensitive to volatility in earnings  from this metric is useful to management and investors 
we believe this non gaap measure is more indicative of our ability to manage our costs and provides a meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry and our prior year results 
investors should consider this non gaap financial measure in addition to  and not as a substitute for  our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap

during the second quarter of  we recorded net gains of approximately million related to the sale of two embraer aircraft and six spare aircraft engines 
during the fourth quarter of  operating income was negatively impacted by approximately million as a result of hurricane sandy 
during the second and fourth quarters of  we recorded million in gains and million in losses  respectively  related to the early extinguishment of a portion of our long term debt 
excludes results of operations and employees of livetv  llc  which are unrelated to our airline operations and are immaterial to our consolidated operating results 
although we experienced significant revenue growth in  this trend may not continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
network concentrations and seasonality we have historically been a highly leisure focused airline subject to seasonality in our business 
our focus in recent years has been to increase our mix of business customers  particularly in boston  to lessen the seasonality impact on our business 
additionally  we believe vfr markets complement our leisure driven markets from both a seasonal and day of week perspective 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes along the east coast are generally realized from october through april and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience poor weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with de icing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced customers 
many of our florida and caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 
as such  we remain focused on trying to reduce the seasonal impact of our operations and increase demand and travel during the trough periods 
liquidity and capital resources the airline business is capital intensive 
our ability to successfully execute our profitable growth plans is largely dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms 
in addition  our ability to successfully operate our business depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity 
we believe we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents and investment securities on hand and two available lines of credit 
additionally  as of december   we had unencumbered a aircraft and nine unencumbered spare engines which we believe could be an additional source of liquidity  if necessary 
we believe a healthy cash balance is crucial to our ability to weather any part of the economic cycle while continuing to execute on our plans for profitable growth and increased returns 
our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity  maintaining financial flexibility and allowing for prudent capital spending  which in turn we expect to lead to improved returns for our shareholders 
as of december  our cash balance declined as compared to a year ago 
the current environment of strong industry fundamentals and low interest rates enabled us to adopt a more reasonable cash balance as compared to prior years as measured by a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 
we believe our current level of cash of approximately of trailing twelve months revenue  combined with our available lines of credit and portfolio of unencumbered assets provides us with a strong liquidity position and the potential for higher returns on cash deployment 
we believe we have taken several important actions during in solidifying our strong balance sheet and overall liquidity position  including increased our available lines of credit up to million as of december  prepaid approximately million in high cost debt  which will result in an annual interest expense savings of approximately million 
increased the number of unencumbered aircraft from one as of december  to as of december  reduced our overall debt balance by million while increasing our total property and equipment by million during prepaid million for certain deliveries and deposits on future aircraft deliveries in exchange for favorable pricing terms 
return on invested capital return on invested capital  or roic  is an important financial metric which we believe provides meaningful information as to how well we generate returns relative to the capital invested in our business 
during  we improved our roic by nearly one percentage point to 
we are committed to taking appropriate actions which will allow us to continue to improve roic while adding capacity and continuing to grow 
we believe this non gaap measure provides a meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry and our prior year results 
investors should consider this non gaap financial measure in addition to  and not as a substitute for  our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap

as of december   our unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue was approximately 
we rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations 
investing activities during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included million for seven airbus a aircraft  four embraer aircraft and five spare engines  million for flight equipment deposits  which includes a million prepayment in exchange for favorable pricing terms and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases  facilities improvements and livetv inflight entertainment equipment inventory were million  which includes the final million for the slots we purchased at laguardia international airport and ronald reagan international airport in and million for ti  which was paid for using cash from operations 
the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of two embraer aircraft and six spare engines is included in investing activities 
investing activities also include the net purchase of million in investment securities 
during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included million for four airbus a aircraft  five embraer aircraft and nine spare engines  million for flight equipment deposits and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases  facilities improvements and livetv inventory  were million  which includes million for the slots we purchased at laguardia international airport and ronald reagan international airport 
investing activities in also included the net proceeds from the sale and maturities of million in investment securities 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases to be approximately million  including approximately million for our investment at ti 
financing activities financing activities during consisted of scheduled maturities of million of debt and capital lease obligations  the pre payment of million in high cost debt secured by seven airbus a aircraft  the repayment of million of debt related to two embraer aircraft which were sold in  proceeds of million in non public floating rate aircraft related financing secured by four airbus a aircraft and four embraer aircraft  the net repayment of million under our available lines of credit  the repayment of million in principal related to our construction obligation for terminal and the acquisition of million treasury shares for million primarily related to our share repurchase program and the withholding of taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock units

in november  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec 
under this universal shelf registration statement  we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time debt securities  pass through certificates  common stock  preferred stock and or other securities 
the net proceeds of any securities we sell under this registration statement may be used to fund working capital and capital expenditures  including the purchase of aircraft and construction of facilities on or near airports 
through december   we had not issued any securities under this registration statement 
at this time  we have no plans to sell any such securities under this registration statement 
we may utilize this universal shelf in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our products and services  the commercialization of our products and services or for other general corporate purposes 
none of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us 
capital resources we have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements 
approximately of our property and equipment is encumbered  excluding airbus a aircraft and nine spare engines which we own free and clear 
we have historically financed our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of aircraft  of which were financed under operating leases  four were financed under capital leases and all but of the remaining were financed by private and public secured debt 
as noted above  we pre paid some of aircraft deliveries 
we have committed financing for two embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery in we plan to opportunistically finance the remaining scheduled deliveries at favorable borrowing terms relative to our weighted average cost of debt 
although we believe debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot give assurance we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to pay in cash  further modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital we had working capital deficit of million at december  compared to working capital of million at december  working capital deficits can be customary in the airline industry since air traffic liability is classified as a current liability 
the significant decrease in our working capital is primarily attributable to approximately million in debt prepayments made during and the million prepayment for future aircraft deliveries 
our working capital includes the fair value of our short term fuel hedge derivatives  which was a net liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
also contributing to our working capital deficit as of december  is million in marketable investment securities classified as long term assets  including million related to a deposit made to lower the interest rate on the debt secured by two aircraft 
these funds on deposit are readily available to us  however  if we were to draw upon this deposit  the interest rates on the debt would revert to the higher rates in effect prior to the re financing 
we have a corporate purchasing line with american express allowing us to borrow up to a maximum of million for the purchase of jet fuel 
borrowings  which are to be paid monthly  are subject to a annual interest rate subject to certain limitations 
this borrowing facility will terminate no later than january  during  we had borrowed up to million on this corporate purchasing line  all of which was fully repaid  leaving the line undrawn as of december  in july  we entered into a revolving line of credit with morgan stanley for up to million  and increased the line of credit for up to million in december this line of credit is secured by a portion of our investment securities held by morgan stanley and the borrowing amount may vary accordingly 
this line of credit bears interest at a floating rate of interest based upon libor plus basis points 
during  we had borrowed up to the maximum million  all of which was fully repaid  leaving the line undrawn as of december we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by financing activities  as they may be available to us 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events beyond our control  such as volatile fuel prices  economic conditions  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies  restructurings or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
debt and capital leases our scheduled debt maturities are expected to increase over the next five years  with a scheduled peak in of nearly million 
our scheduled debt maturities in include final mortgage payments on six airbus a aircraft  which will further increase our portfolio of unencumbered assets 
as part of our efforts to effectively manage our balance sheet and improve roic  we expect to continue to actively manage our debt balances 
our approach to debt management includes managing the mix of fixed vs 
floating rate debt  managing the annual maturities of debt  and managing the weighted average cost of debt 
further  we intend to continue to opportunistically pre purchase outstanding debt when market conditions and terms are favorable 
additionally  our unencumbered assets  including a aircraft  allows us some flexibility in managing our cost of debt and capital requirements 
contractual obligations our noncancelable contractual obligations at december  include in millions payments due in total thereafter long term debt and capital lease obligations lease commitments flight equipment obligations financing obligations and other total includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates 
amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
the interest rates are fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the weighted average maturity of all of our debt was years at december  we are subject to certain financial ratios for our unsecured line of credit issued in september  including a requirement to maintain certain cash and short term investment levels and a minimum earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda margin  as well as customary events of default 
we are subject to certain collateral ratio requirements in our spare parts pass through certificates and spare engine financing issued in november and december  respectively 
if we fail to maintain these collateral ratios  we are required to provide additional collateral or redeem some or all of the equipment notes so the ratios return to compliance 
as a result of lower spare parts inventory balances and the associated reduced third party valuation of these parts  we pledged as collateral a previously unencumbered spare engine with a carrying value of approximately million during the second quarter of during the third quarter of  we did not meet the minimum ratios on our spare parts pass through certificates due to the reduced third party valuation of these parts 
in order to maintain the ratios  we elected to redeem million of the equipment notes in november at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt and lease agreements and of our owned property and equipment were pledged as security under various loan agreements 
we have operating lease obligations for aircraft with lease terms that expire between and five of these leases have variable rate rent payments that adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have approximately million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related leases 
our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft  airbus a aircraft  airbus a neo aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in and in we expect to meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
our aircraft orders reflect contract modifications entered in in july  we amended our embraer purchase agreement accelerating the delivery of one aircraft to which was previously scheduled for delivery in additionally  we extended the date by which we may elect not to further amend our purchase agreement to order a new embraer variant  if developed  to july  if the new variant is not elected  seven embraer aircraft we previously deferred may either be returned to their original delivery dates in and or canceled and subject to cancellation fees 
in december  we further amended this agreement effectively accelerating the delivery of four aircraft from to in october  we began operating out of our new terminal at jfk  or terminal  which we had been constructing since november the construction and operation of this facility is governed by a lease agreement we entered into with the panynj in we are responsible for making various payments under the lease  including ground rents for the terminal site which began on lease execution in and facility rents commenced in october upon our occupancy of the terminal 
the facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the terminal  subject to annual minimums 
the panynj has reimbursed us for costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease  except for approximately million in leasehold improvements provided by us 
for financial reporting purposes  this project is being accounted for as a financing obligation  with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our balance sheets 
minimum ground and facility rents for this terminal totaling billion are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with various suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed crewmembers as well as inspectors and air traffic controllers 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless the crewmember is terminated for cause or the crewmember elects not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these crewmembers can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business requiring a reduction in flying and related work hours  we are obligated to pay these crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are with variable interest entities  as defined by the consolidations topic of the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or codification  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each financing alternative and a consideration of liquidity implications 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and certain aircraft spare parts owned by jetblue and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates and the spare parts certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we use a policy provider to provide credit support on our class g and class g floating rate enhanced equipment notes 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financial statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially deferred in air traffic liability 
the air traffic liability also includes customer credits issued and unused tickets whose travel date has passed 
credit for unused tickets and customer credits can each be applied towards another ticket within months of the original scheduled service or months from the issuance of the customer credit 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket or customer credit expires 
we also defer  in air traffic liability  an estimate for customer credits issued in conjunction with the jetblue airways customer bill of rights we expect to be ultimately redeemed 
these estimates are based on historical experience and are periodically evaluated  and adjusted if necessary  based on actual credit usage 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  or trueblue 
we record a liability  which was million and million as of december  and  respectively  for the estimated incremental cost of outstanding points earned from jetblue purchases that we expect to be redeemed 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
we adjust this liability  which is included in air traffic liability  based on points earned and redeemed  changes in the estimated incremental costs associated with providing travel and changes in the trueblue program 
in november  we launched an improved version of trueblue  which allows customers to earn points based on the value paid for a trip rather than the length of the trip 
in addition  unlike our original program  the improved version does not result in the automatic generation of a travel award once minimum award levels are reached  but instead the points are maintained in the account until used by the member or until they expire months after the last account activity 
as a result of these changes  breakage  or the points that ultimately expire unused  has been substantially reduced 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the minimum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
points in trueblue can also be sold to participating companies  including credit card and car rental companies 
these sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  with one element representing the fair value of the travel that will ultimately be provided when the points are redeemed and the other consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company 
the fair value of the transportation portion of these point sales is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is provided 
the marketing portion  which is the excess of the total sales proceeds over the estimated fair value of the transportation to be provided  is recognized in other revenue when the points are sold 
deferred revenue for points sold and not redeemed is recognized as revenue when the underlying points expire 
deferred revenue was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the terms of expiration of all points under our original loyalty program were modified with the launch of a new version of trueblue in we recorded million and million in revenue for point expirations in and  respectively 
our co branded credit card agreement  under which we sell trueblue points as described above  provided for a minimum cash payment guarantee  which was paid to us throughout the life of the agreement if specified point sales and other ancillary activity payments were not achieved and was subject to refund in the event that cash payments exceeded future minimums through april we recorded revenue related to this guarantee when the likelihood of us providing any future service was remote 
we recognized approximately million related to this guarantee in and the balance of this guarantee of approximately million in accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive operating cash flows  we have not identified any significant impairment related to our long lived assets at this time 
lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term and periodic adjustments of lease rates  landing fees  and other charges applicable under such agreements  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations and other adjustments have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the lease that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes 
at december   we had a net million liability related to the net fair value of these derivative instruments  the majority of which are not traded on a public exchange 
fair values are determined using commodity prices provided to us by independent third parties 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by the derivatives and hedging topic of the codification which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
the derivatives and hedging topic is a complex accounting standard and requires that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and fuel management approach  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged ie aircraft fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires we estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel 
these prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or jet fuel swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all hedge contracts existing at december  settle by september  the financial derivative instrument agreements we have with our counterparties may require us to fund all  or a portion of  outstanding loss positions related to these contracts prior to their scheduled maturities 
the amount of collateral posted  if any  is periodically adjusted based on the fair value of the hedge contracts 
interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
the interest rate is fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
if interest rates were  on average  basis points higher in than they were during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would remain relatively constant  similar to the relative constant level of interest income for measured as of december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt had a total estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if there were a increase in stock prices  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
