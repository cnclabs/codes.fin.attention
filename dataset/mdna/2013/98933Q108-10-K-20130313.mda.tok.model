item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary controlled cooling technology platform 
our first commercial product  the coolsculpting system  is designed to selectively reduce stubborn fat bulges that may not respond to diet or exercise 
we generate revenues from sales of our coolsculpting system and from sales of consumables when our physician customers pay for each coolsculpting procedure they perform 
we received clearance from the fda in september to market coolsculpting for the selective reduction of fat around the flanks  an area commonly referred to as the love handles 
in may  coolsculpting was cleared by the fda for treatment of belly fat or non surgical reduction of fat for the abdomen area 
we may seek additional regulatory clearances from the fda to expand our us marketed indications for coolsculpting to areas on the body other than the flanks and abdomen 
we have received regulatory approval or are otherwise free to market coolsculpting in international markets where use of the product is generally not limited to specific treatment areas 
physicians in these markets commonly perform coolsculpting procedures on the inner thighs  back  and chest  in addition to the flanks and abdomen 
as of december   our worldwide sales force consisted of professionals 
in the united states  canada and four key markets in europe united kingdom  germany  france and spain  we use our direct sales organization to selectively market 
table of contents coolsculpting 
in markets outside of north america and the four key markets in europe  we sell coolsculpting through a network of distributors 
we intend to continue developing our international sales and marketing organization to focus on increasing sales and strengthening our physician relationships 
we also intend to seek regulatory approval to market coolsculpting in key additional international markets  including china 
revenues from markets outside of north america accounted for of our total revenues for the years ended december  and our ongoing research and development activities are primarily focused on improving and enhancing our coolsculpting system and coolsculpting procedure 
in addition to these development activities related to coolsculpting  we are exploring additional uses of our proprietary controlled cooling technology platform for the dermatology  plastic surgery  and aesthetic markets 
we are also exploring potential therapeutic uses for our platform technology  either directly or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners 
in october  we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  at which time we sold a total of  shares of our common stock and certain of our stockholders sold  shares of our common stock 
we received net proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with the offering 
revenues we generate revenues from sales of our coolsculpting system and from sales of consumables when our physician customers pay for each coolsculpting procedure they perform 
we generated revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
systems revenues 
sales of our coolsculpting system include the coolsculpting control unit and our coolsculpting vacuum applicators 
some practices may purchase more than one coolsculpting system 
our standard terms do not allow for trial or evaluation periods  rights of return  or refund payments contingent upon the customer obtaining financing or other terms that could impact the customer s obligation 
during the year ended december   our system sales were impacted by new product launches and trial offers by our competitors that created competition for physician capital equipment dollars 
despite this  we grew our worldwide installed base by from units as of december   to  units as of december  consumable revenues 
we generate consumable revenues through sales of coolsculpting procedure packs  each of which includes our consumable coolgels and coolliners and a disposable computer cartridge that we market as the coolcard 
the coolcard contains enabling software that permits our physician customer to perform a fixed number of coolsculpting procedures 
consumable revenues accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and december   we shipped approximately  and  coolsculpting procedure packs to our physician customers  respectively 
our business plan focuses on expanding our base of physician customers  and increasing our consumable revenues by driving demand for coolsculpting procedures through our physician and consumer marketing programs 
we anticipate that as we implement our business plan our consumable revenues will increase as a percentage of our total revenues 
seasonality 
seasonal fluctuations in the number of physician customers in their offices and available to take appointments as well as their patients have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
specifically  our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to perform fewer procedures  particularly in europe 
these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause  fluctuations in our quarterly results  including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 
market in which we operate 
the medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic  and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations 
we compete with many other technologies for consumer demand 
further  the aesthetic industry in which we operate is particularly vulnerable to economic trends 
the decision to undergo a procedure from our systems is driven by consumer demand 
most procedures performed using our systems are elective procedures  the cost of which must be borne by the patient  and are not reimbursable through government or private health insurance 
in times of economic uncertainty or recession  individuals often reduce the amount of money that they spend on discretionary items  including aesthetic procedures 
the general economic difficulties being experienced and the lack of availability of consumer credit for some of our customers patients are adversely affecting the market in which we operate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable 
table of contents periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions  and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements  which  in turn  could materially change our results from those reported 
management evaluates its estimates  assumptions  and judgments on an ongoing basis 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
however  if our assumptions change  we may need to revise our estimates  or take other corrective actions  either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of zeltiq and its wholly owned subsidiary 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas where management applies judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived from the sales of the coolsculpting system  consisting of a control unit and applicators  and from procedure packs  consisting of consumables and coolcards 
embedded software exists in the coolcard product to permit our physician customers to perform a fixed number of coolsculpting procedures 
this software is not marketed separately from the coolsculpting system or from the coolcard 
rather  the functionality that the software provides is part of the overall coolcard product 
the coolsculpting system is marketed as a non invasive aesthetic device for the reduction of fat  not for its embedded software attributes included in the coolcard that enable its use 
we do not provide rights to upgrades and enhancements or post contract customer support for the embedded software 
in addition  we do not incur significant software development costs or capitalize our software development costs 
based on this assessment  we consider the embedded software in the coolcard incidental to the coolcard product as a whole and determined that revenue recognition should not be governed by the provisions of topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  or asc 
we earn revenue from the sale of our products to physicians and to distributors 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of title to the customer has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenues are deferred in the event that any of the revenue recognition criteria is not met 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we use contracts or customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
transfer of title 
our standard terms generally specify that title transfers upon shipment to the customer 
we use third party shipping documents to verify that title has transferred 
sales price fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable at the time of the transaction 
sales prices are documented in the executed sales contract or purchase order received prior to shipment 
our standard terms do not allow for trial or evaluation periods  rights of return or refund  payments contingent upon the customer obtaining financing or other terms that could impact the customer obligation 
collectability 
we assess whether collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including the customer past transaction history and credit worthiness 
multiple element arrangements 
typically  all products sold to a customer are delivered at the same time 
if a partial delivery occurs as authorized by the customer  we allocate revenue to the various products based on their vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  if vsoe exists according to asc as the basis of determining the relative selling price of each element 
if vsoe does not exist  we may use third party evidence of fair value  or tpe  to determine the relative selling price of each element 
if neither vsoe nor tpe exists  we may use management best estimate of the sales price  or esp  of each element to determine the relative selling price 
the relative selling prices for control units  applicators and coolcards are based on established price lists and separate  stand alone sales of these elements 
we establish best estimates within a range of selling prices considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  factors such as size of transaction  pricing strategies and market conditions 
we believe the use of the esp allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction 
our products do not require maintenance or support 
shipping and handling costs 
shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of revenues 
in those cases where we bill shipping and handling costs to customers  the amounts billed are classified as revenue 

table of contents investments we invest our excess cash balances primarily in certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and us government agency securities 
investments with original maturities greater than days that mature less than one year from the consolidated balance sheet date are classified as short term investments 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale and record such assets at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheets  with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from maturities of all such securities are reported in earnings and computed using the specific identification cost method 
realized gains or losses and charges for other than temporary declines in value  if any  on available for sale securities are reported in other income expense as incurred 
we periodically evaluate these investments for other than temporary impairment 
product warranty for  we provided a three year standard warranty on our coolsculpting control units and a one year warranty on our coolsculpting applicators 
in addition to these product warranties  we offered two years of extended warranty service on our control units and applicators 
for our direct customers in europe  we offered a one year standard warranty on our coolsculpting control units and applicators with an option for two years of extended warranty service on both 
in  we will transition to offering a one year standard warranty on all of our coolsculpting control units worldwide 
in the event of a warranty claim  our customer care department arranges for a prompt service call 
our goal is to minimize the disruption caused by a service event  and we strive to repair a customer coolsculpting system or provide the customer with a replacement coolsculpting system promptly after notifying us of a problem 
in markets outside of north america  our coolsculpting system is serviced and supported through our independent distributors and certified third party service providers 
we estimate and provide for future costs for initial product warranties upon shipment 
we base product warranty costs on related freight  material  technical support labor  and overhead costs 
we provide for the estimated product warranty costs by considering our historical costs and applying the experience rates to each product sold over the outstanding warranty period 
we must exercise judgment in estimating our expected product warranty costs 
if actual product failure rates  freight  material  technical support  labor  and overhead costs differ from our estimates  we will be required to revise our estimated warranty liability 
we have recorded a liability of million and million as of december  and  respectively  for future warranty expense 
we offer an extended warranty of up to two years on both our coolsculpting control units and coolsculpting vacuum applicators 
we recognize the revenues from the sale of an extended warranty over the extended warranty coverage period 
our revenue and related obligations from sale of extended warranties to date has not been significant 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions  including but not limited to the united states and united kingdom  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we calculate deferred tax asset or liability account balances at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect our taxable income 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we recognize a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a million valuation allowance against million of deferred tax assets 
we follow the accounting guidance for uncertainties in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken in a tax return  in the consolidated financial statements 
none of our currently unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective income tax rate if recognized  due to the valuation allowance that currently offsets our deferred tax assets 
we do not anticipate the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at december   will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 

table of contents we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and whether the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
our judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be limited by ownership change rules  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
similar rules may apply under state tax laws 
in the event we experience any subsequent changes in ownership  the amount of net operating losses and research and development credit carryovers available in any taxable year could be limited and may expire unutilized

the notes carried an interest rate of per annum 
the repayment of principal  plus interest  was via monthly installments over a month period for each tranche  beginning with the disbursement date of each tranche 
on january   in accordance with the loan agreement  we issued a warrant to silicon valley bank to purchase  shares of series c preferred stock at per share 
the fair value of this warrant was recorded as a debt discount at issuance and has been amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes

table of contents purchase commitments we had non cancellable purchase obligations to contract manufacturers and suppliers for million at december   which are all payable in product warranty we provide a standard limited warranty on our products  generally three years for control units and one year for applicators 
for our direct customers in europe  we offer a one year standard warranty on our coolsculpting control units 
we accrue for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement upon shipment 
the warranty accrual is recorded to cost of revenues and is based upon historical and forecasted trends in the volume of product failures during the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
we base product warranty costs on related freight  material  technical support labor  and overhead costs 
the estimated product warranty costs are assessed by considering historical costs and applying the experienced failure rates to the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
we exercise judgment in estimating the expected product warranty costs  using data such as the actual and projected product failure rates  and average repair costs  including freight  material  technical support labor  and overhead costs  for products returned under warranty

we filed our response to the second amended complaint  and we believe the lawsuit to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend it

recent accounting pronouncements on february   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this guidance is the culmination of the fasb redeliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income 
we will adopt this guidance effective january  and we do not anticipate the adoption to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications 
our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future  but have not yet been made 
to date  we have not paid any claims  and we believe that the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal and we have not accrued any amounts for these obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks primarily include interest rate fluctuations and inflation 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has been insignificant because the majority of our revenues and our expenses are incurred and paid in us dollars 
interest rate fluctuations we hold cash equivalents as well as short term and long term fixed income securities 
all maturities are less than two years 
our holdings include fixed and floating rate securities 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income 
the fair market value of our holdings may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million invested in available for sale short term and long term investments 
there were no such investments as of december  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

table of contents we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december   and therefore  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
foreign exchange our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has been insignificant because our revenues and our expenses are generally incurred and paid in us dollars
