item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated building products 
our two principal business segments are olefins and vinyls 
we use the majority of our internally produced basic chemicals to produce higher value added chemicals and building products 
consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly since we began operations in our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value added chemical products used in many end markets 
petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies 
the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics  and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates  the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials 
the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply  leading to high operating rates and margins  followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of significant capacity additions 
due to the significant size of new plants  capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed 
beginning in and continuing through  a cost advantage for ethane based ethylene producers over naphtha based ethylene producers allowed a strong export market and higher margins for north american chemical producers  including westlake 
increased global demand for polyethylene since has resulted in improved operating margins and cash flow for our olefins segment 
however  some olefins industry consultants predict that a significant increase in worldwide ethylene and ethylene derivative capacity may occur within the next decade  with the largest increases in asia and north america 
as a result  our olefins segment operating margins may be negatively impacted 
weakness in the us construction markets  which began in the third quarter of  and the subsequent budgetary constraints in municipal spending  have contributed to lower domestic demand for our vinyls products 
in addition  increases in feedstock costs  combined with the industry inability to sufficiently raise domestic prices for pvc resin and building products in order to offset cost increases  affected our vinyls segment operating results in and however  since late  the pvc industry has experienced an increase in pvc resin export demand  driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in north america 
as a consequence  domestic pvc resin industry operating rates have improved since  largely due to higher pvc resin export shipments 
however  looking forward  our vinyls segment operating rates and margins may continue to be negatively impacted by the slow recovery of us construction markets 
while the economic environment continues to be challenging for our customers  we believe our customer base remains generally healthy 
as we continue to manage our business in this environment  including the slowdown in construction activity  we have taken steps designed to address the changes in demand and margins in our vinyls segment and its resulting impact on our operations by matching production with sales demand and continuing to operate our plants in an efficient manner 
we continue to monitor our cost management programs and discretionary capital spending 
the impact of the global economic environment has been challenging to our business and  depending on the performance of the global economy in and beyond  could have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we purchase significant amounts of ethane and propane feedstock  natural gas  ethylene  chlorine and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains 
we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes 
while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane and propane feedstocks  natural gas  ethylene  chlorine  salt and electricity  the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past  and which may do so in the future include the availability of feedstock from shale gas and oil drilling  shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand  ethane  propane and liquefied natural gas exports  capacity constraints due to construction delays  strike action or involuntary shutdowns  the general level of business and economic activity  and the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 
significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices 
we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and 
table of contents lower overall costs 
normally  there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived 
when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship 
our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity  our efficient use of the capacity and our ability to increase our capacity 
since our inception  we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions  new plant construction and internal expansion 
we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs 
as noted above in item a  risk factors  we are subject to extensive environmental regulations  which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future 
further  concern about ghg emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations  and to proposed legislation and additional regulations that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel  other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products 
while we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term  we cannot predict the longer term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
recent developments we previously announced an expansion program to increase the ethane based ethylene capacity of both of the ethylene units at our lake charles complex 
in january  we commenced the expansion of the petro ethylene unit 
this expansion is expected to be completed in the first quarter of in conjunction with a planned maintenance turnaround and is expected to increase ethane based ethylene capacity by approximately million pounds annually in support of our ethylene integration strategy 
the petro ethylene unit is expected to be down for approximately days for the planned maintenance turnaround 
in addition  we plan to expand the ethane based ethylene capacity of the second ethylene unit at our lake charles complex  but we are still evaluating plans for this expansion 
in october  we announced a project to convert the feedstock for our calvert city ethylene plant from propane to ethane and the planned increase in ethylene capacity from million pounds annually to million pounds annually 
this expansion and feedstock conversion project is expected to enhance our vinyl chain integration and leverage low cost ethane being developed in the marcellus shale area 
the ethylene expansion and feedstock conversion project is targeted for start up in the second quarter of in addition  we announced an expansion of the existing pvc plant in calvert city  which should allow us to take advantage of the increased ethylene production at our calvert city complex and to provide additional pvc resin to meet the growing demands of our global customers 
the expansion of the calvert city pvc plant is expected to increase pvc resin capacity by approximately million pounds annually and is targeted for completion by late on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes due 
on july   we voluntarily redeemed all million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due the notes  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes due  plus cash on hand  to pay the redemption price of the notes 
as a result of the early redemption of the notes  we recognized million in non operating expense in consisting primarily of a pre payment premium of million and a write off of million in previously capitalized debt issuance costs 
on march   a fire occurred at the vcm unit at our geismar vinyls complex  resulting in an unscheduled shut down of our geismar complex 
vcm is an intermediate product used in the production of pvc at that complex 
we restarted the pvc and vcm plants at our geismar complex in late april and mid may  respectively  but operated both plants at reduced capacity until we returned them to normal operations in june in addition to the lost production resulting from the shut down  we incurred repair costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs in connection with the shutdown  which negatively impacted our vinyls segment income from operations in

the bonds are subject to redemption  repurchase by the holders upon a change of control or a change in or loss of the current tax status of the bonds and optional redemption by the authority under terms substantially similar to the terms for the go zone bonds 
in connection with the offering of the bonds  we entered into a loan agreement with the authority pursuant to which we agreed to pay all of the principal  premium  if any  and interest on the bonds and certain other amounts to the authority 
the net proceeds from the offering were lent by the authority to us 
we used the proceeds to expand  refurbish and maintain certain of our facilities in the louisiana parish of calcasieu 
the ike zone senior notes due are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the senior notes in excess of million are guarantors of the ike zone senior notes due as of december   we had drawn all the proceeds from the ike zone senior notes due the indentures governing the senior notes contain customary covenants and events of default 
accordingly  these agreements generally impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions  among other things  provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets 
however  the effectiveness of certain of these restrictions is currently suspended because the senior notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
the most significant of these provisions  if it were currently effective  would restrict us from incurring additional debt  except specified permitted debt including borrowings under our credit facility  when our fixed charge coverage ratio is below these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  including  without limitation  an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share currently per share 
if the restrictions were currently effective  distributions in excess of million would not be allowed unless  after giving pro forma effect to the distribution  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least and such payment  together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january   is less than the sum of of our consolidated net income for the period from october  to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed  plus of net cash proceeds received after 
table of contents october  as a contribution to our common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities  plus several other adjustments 
revenue bonds in december  we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu  louisiana 
the public trust issued million principal amount of tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant 
the waste disposal revenue bonds expire in december and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions 
interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly 
the interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at december  and was and  respectively 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in addition to long term debt  we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations 
the following table summarizes our minimum payments as of december  relating to long term debt  operating leases  pension benefits funding  post retirement healthcare benefits  unconditional purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter 
the amounts do not include deferred charges  liabilities for uncertain tax positions and other items classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of the future payment schedule

long term debt consists of the notes due  senior notes due  the senior notes due  the go zone senior notes due and the ike zone senior notes due and the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds 
operating leases 
we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases primarily related to rail car leases and land for various periods 
pension benefits funding 
we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible salaried and wage employees of one subsidiary 
we expect to contribute approximately million and million in and  respectively  for plan years and funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans have not been determined for plan years and beyond 
due to the uncertainty of the funding  no amounts with respect to such plan years have been included in the table above 
long term liabilities for pension benefits were million as of december  see the discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
post retirement healthcare benefits 
we provide post retirement healthcare benefits to the employees of two subsidiaries who meet certain minimum age and service requirements 
see the discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents unconditional purchase obligations 
we are party to various unconditional obligations  primarily to purchase goods and services  including commitments to purchase various utilities  feedstock  nitrogen  oxygen  product storage and pipeline usage 
we also have various purchase commitments for our capital projects and for materials  supplies and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business which may not be unconditional and are not reflected in the table above 
interest payments 
interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at december  and assume contractual amortization payments 
standby letters of credit 
this includes our obligation under an million letter of credit issued in connection with the million tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and other letters of credit totaling million issued to support obligations under our insurance programs  including workers compensation claims and other commercial obligations

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with gaap 
our more critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accruals for long term employee benefits  inventories  accounts receivable  income taxes and environmental and legal obligations 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates 
we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
long lived assets 
key estimates related to long lived assets include useful lives  recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations 
such estimates could be significantly modified 
the carrying values of long lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins  new technological developments  new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages  adverse changes associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses 
actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated 
long lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from three to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
we defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities  or turnarounds  and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit 
in  we completed a turnaround at our styrene plant in lake charles 
in  we completed a major turnaround at our calvert city facility 
total costs deferred on these turnarounds were million in and million in there were no planned major maintenance activities in amortization in  and of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   deferred turnaround costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
expensing turnaround costs as incurred would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents additional information concerning long lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
fair value estimates 
we develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition  to assess impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets and to record equity securities  derivative instruments and pension plan assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the engagement of third party consultants 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million  all of which was associated with the acquisition of our longview facilities 
in addition  we record all equity securities  derivative instruments and pension plan assets at fair value 
the fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market based inputs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
long term employee benefit costs 
our costs for long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is our responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties 
it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and  if necessary  adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we rely extensively on advice from actuaries  and we make assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded 
changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts 
two of the more significant assumptions relate to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
at december   the projected pension benefit obligation was calculated using an assumed weighted average discount rate of 
the discount rate was determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate 
the return on asset assumption of is based on historical asset returns  anticipated future performance of the investments and financial markets and input from our third party independent actuary and the pension fund trustee 
as a result of the strong returns on plan assets that occurred during and the funding relief provided in the moving ahead for progress in the st century act  we expect funding requirements for the pension plans to decrease in additional information on the funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
assumed healthcare trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans because benefits for participants are capped at a fixed amount 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  and consistent with our accounting policy  we estimate the amount of accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected and we record an expense of that amount 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strength of our customers  and  in our analysis  we combine the use of historical experience  our accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
balances over days past due and accounts determined by our analysis of financial strength of customers to be high risk are reviewed individually for collectibility 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes 
deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
environmental and legal obligations 
we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings 
we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the 
table of contents actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable 
we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products 
based on our open derivative positions at december   a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before taxes by million  a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of propane would have decreased our income before taxes by million and a hypothetical increase in the price of a pound of ethylene would have decreased our income before taxes by million 
additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appears in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million outstanding 
all of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility none was outstanding at december  and our loan relating to the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds are at variable rates 
we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt  but we may do so in the future 
the average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of million as of december  was 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
also  at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt 
we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced 
if interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
