item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing revenues  operating earnings  depreciation and certain costs are as follows in thousands revenues crude oil natural gas total operating earnings loss crude oil natural gas total depreciation crude oil natural gas total fleet diesel fuel costs supplemental volume and price information is field level purchases per day crude oil barrels natural gas mmbtu s average purchase price crude oil per barrel natural gas per mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points 
crude oil revenues increased in relative to and in relative to because of increased field level purchase volumes and generally higher average crude oil prices as shown in the table above 
volume increases primarily resulted from new well production established by the company s customer base in the eagle ford shale trend of south texas beginning in  while prices fluctuated upwards with general market conditions 
crude oil field level operating earnings non gaap measure two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil segment operating earnings are inventory valuations and forward commodity contract derivatives or mark to market valuations 
as a purchaser and shipper of crude oil  the company holds inventory in storage tanks and third party pipelines 
inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days  but the quantity held in stock at the end of a given period is reasonably consistent 
as a result  during periods of increasing crude oil prices  the company recognizes inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices  the company recognizes inventory liquidation and valuation losses 
over time  these gains and losses tend to offset and have limited impact on cash flow 
while crude oil prices fluctuated during  the net impact yielded inventory liquidation losses totaling  as prices trended down from per barrel in the beginning of the year to average per barrel at year end 
in contrast  crude oil prices were as generally rising during and producing inventory valuation gains of  and  respectively 
as of december   the company held  barrels of crude oil inventory at an average price of per barrel 
crude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of the company s forward month commodity contracts derivative instruments as of the various report dates 
such non cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date 
the company generally enters into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead field level 
only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead field level are not accorded fair value treatment 
the valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires the recognition of mark to market gains and losses 
the impact on crude oil segment operating earnings of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations is summarized as follows in thousands as reported segment operating earnings add less inventory liquidation gains losses derivative valuation gains losses field level operating earnings such designation is unique to the company and is not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants 
field level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes see earlier table depict the company s day to day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead  transporting the material  and delivering it to market at the sales point 
comparative crude oil field level operating earnings increased in relative to and in relative to with the noted volume additions and overall improved unit margins for the comparative periods 
unit margins first began to widen during the third quarter of when south texas sourced production started selling at a discount to world crude oil prices due to its relative abundance in relation to the infrastructure available to deliver such oil to market 
the initial burst in unit margins was most prevalent during the third quarter of with favorable unit margins continuing into  although they diminished as competition and additional industry infrastructure development progressed in the region 
natural gas marketing natural gas sales are reported net of underlying natural gas purchase costs and thus reflect gross margin 
as shown in the table above  gross margins were reduced during and again in as average field level purchase volumes were off over percent during the periods presented 
the company s primary source of natural gas supply is the non shale areas of texas  louisiana and the gulf of mexico and these volumes declined because the company s suppliers curtailed drilling activity due to suppressed natural gas prices 
in addition  development of the nation s natural gas infrastructure including more diverse areas of production  expanded pipeline and storage capacity  and increased price transparency with the development of the intercontinental exchange ice have reduced purchase opportunities and per unit margins 
historically  prices received for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
see discussion under item a risk factors 
transportation the transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
revenues and operating results improved for the transportation segment in both and due to increased customer demand 
the company also benefitted in and from million and million in gains  respectively  from the sale of used equipment following the purchase of new truck replacements 
the company s customers predominately consist of the domestic petrochemical industry and demand for their products has substantially recovered from the slow down occurring in serving to improve customer demand was a recovering united states economy  low natural gas prices a basic feedstock cost for the petrochemical industry and improved export demand for petrochemicals 
in addition  during the previous economic downturn  the trucking industry reduced capacity by retiring older units without replacement 
with demand improvement  industry capacity has been strained allowing rate increases and improved overall profitability 
however  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers has affected the company by suppressing current year revenues and results of operations 
as transportation revenues increase or decrease  operating earnings will typically increase or decrease at an accelerated rate 
this trend exists because the fixed cost components of the company s operation do not vary with changing revenues 
as currently configured  operating earnings project at break even levels when annual revenues average approximately million 
above that level  operating earnings will grow and below that level  losses result 
transportation segment depreciation increased for as older fully depreciated tractor units were replaced with new model year vehicles 
during  the company replaced truck tractors and one trailer 
during the company replaced older model truck tractor units and added new units to the fleet 
in addition  trailers were added to the fleet during for relative to  increased depreciation expense on new tractor models was offset by certain in service trailers becoming fully depreciated during the period 
oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts for revenues  operating earnings and depreciation and depletion were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings loss depreciation and depletion producing property impairments represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
includes gains from property sales of million and million in and  respectively 
improved oil and gas segment revenues during and resulted from crude oil and natural gas volumes increases as shown in the table below with such volume changes resulting from recent drilling efforts 
active drilling  however  also served to increase depreciation and depletion expenses as well as property impairment charges during and operating earnings were markedly reduced in due to increased charges for depreciation  depletion and producing property impairments as well as increased exploration and prospect impairment expenses as shown in the second table below 
producing and non producing property impairments increased significantly in following a december decline in the current and forward price for natural gas 
natural gas prices remained at relatively low levels during resulting in additional impairment charges for the year

proved reserves beginning of year estimated reserve additions production volumes producing properties sold revisions of previous estimates proved reserves end of year for and for the three year period ended december   estimated reserve additions represented percent and percent  respectively  of production volumes 
such reserve additions resulted from active drilling efforts during the periods presented 
given the present low natural gas price environment  exploration and development activity during will be substantially reduced 
the company s current drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows east texas project in  the company joined with its partners in acquiring acreage in nacogdoches and shelby counties  texas 
this was subsequently expanded to include acreage in angelina county  due south of nacogdoches county 
this investment holds potential for development in the haynesville bossier shale formations 
a total of wells have been drilled with wells placed on production as of december  the company s interest in this project varies with an average percent ownership in the properties and wells 
production is dry gas and due to low prices only those wells required to hold acreage by production will be drilled 
the company s interest covers  gross acres 
approximately  is being held by production  another  acres is held by the production from non owned shallow wells 
the remaining acreage is either undeveloped or being held by contracts that delay termination of lease rights 
west texas project in the company participated with an approximate working interest in the acquisition of  gross acres located in irion and crockett counties  texas for the purpose of developing the wolfcamp shale 
in the company sold a portion of its interest in anticipation of an aggressive horizontal drilling program on the acreage 
a total of wells have been drilled through december  with wells on production and wells being completed 
drilling is expected to continue but at a reduced rate in with wells scheduled for drilling 
production from the wolfcamp in this area is oil rich with large amounts of gas and natural gas liquids 
south texas project the goal of this investment is to extend the productive area of the eagle ford trend north in fayette and lavaca counties  texas 
the first core well was productive with petrochemical data showing the project is on the gas condensate window 
plans call for up to four additional horizontal wells being initiated during the company holds a five percent working interest in this project which includes approximately  acres currently under lease 
oil and gas property sales in august  the company sold to a third party fifty percent of its interest in certain kansas oil and gas properties 
the properties contained one producing well with insignificant production history 
the sale was consummated to spur further development on the properties 
total proceeds from the sale were  and the company recorded a  pre tax gain on sale 
the company will continue to participate in the development of these kansas properties 
in october and december  the company sold  to third parties  its interest in two separate oil and gas producing properties 
one of the properties was located on shore texas with the second property located in federal waters offshore louisiana 
proceeds from these two sales totaled  and the company recorded a  pre tax gain 
both properties had depleted substantially from their initial productive period  so the sales were consummated before the properties lost further value 
in january  the company completed the sale of its interest in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the on shore gulf coast region of texas 
proceeds from the sale totaled million and the pre tax gain from this transaction totaled  sales negotiations were conducted by the third party operator of the properties and the transaction was completed with a separate third party investment entity 
the company s proportionate interest in the transaction was approximately five percent and the company elected to participate in the sale due to attractive pricing 
also during the first quarter of  the company sold a portion of its interest in certain non producing oil and gas properties located in west texas 
total proceeds from the sale were  and the company recorded a  gain from this transaction 
proceeds from the sales were used for general working capital purposes and the company is continuing with oil and gas exploration operations in the vicinity of the properties sold 
in october  the company sold an interest in certain non producing properties for  in proceeds and gain 
general and administrative  interest income and income tax general and administrative expenses were generally consistent during the periods presented with elevated costs in and due to employee bonuses  consistent with increased corporate earnings 
interest income declined after as interest rates on overnight deposits dropped to near zero following the significant turmoil that occurred in the financial markets during that period 
the provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods 
outlook the short term outlook indicates continued volume growth and relative margin strength within the crude oil marketing operation 
however  industry competitors and company suppliers are aware of the present market opportunity and seek to capture such advantage which would reduce unit margins 
transportation operations continue to experience strong demand  in part due to low natural gas prices 
the oil and gas segment should experience improved results for with stabilized prices and production from new well additions while depreciation  depletion and impairment charges reduce with less activity planned for the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level exclusive of inventory valuation gains or losses 
maintain transportation operating earnings at the million level 
restore oil and gas operating earnings to the million level 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity primarily derives from net cash provided from operating activities  which was   and  for each of  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of december   and such balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day to day cash needs 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  totaled  as of december  the company heavily relies on its ability to obtain open line trade credit from its suppliers especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation 
in this regard  the company generally maintains substantial cash balances and avoids debt obligations 
capital expenditures during included  for marketing and transportation equipment additions  primarily consisting of truck tractors  and  in property additions associated with oil and gas exploration and production activities 
for  the company anticipates expending an additional approximately million on oil and gas development and exploration projects 
in addition  approximately million will be expended during for the purchase of trailers for the transportation segment and approximately million will be expended by the crude oil marketing operation for the purchase of truck tractors  trailers and the construction of a barge loading facility 
these units will serve to replace older units and to increase the marketing fleet by units 
funding for these projects will be from operating cash flow and available working capital 
within certain constraints  the proposed projects can be delayed or cancelled should funding become unavailable 
at various times during each month  the company makes cash prepayments and or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within the marketing operations 
crude oil supply prepayments totaled  as of december  and such amounts will be recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the company 
the company also requires certain counterparties to post cash collateral with the company in order to support their purchase from the company 
such cash collateral held by the company totaled  as of december  the company also maintains a stand by letter of credit facility with wells fargo bank to provide for the issuance of up to million in stand by letters of credit to suppliers of crude oil and natural gas see note to consolidated financial statements 
the issuance of stand by letters of credit enables the company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil and natural gas supply 
as of december   letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
the issued stand by letters of credit are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due 
management believes current cash balances  together with expected cash generated from future operations  and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements should the need arise will be sufficient to meet short term and long term liquidity needs 
the company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing  transportation and exploration businesses  which comprise substantially all of the company s investing cash outflows for each of the periods in this filing 
the company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs 
except for an approximate million commitment for storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space  the company s future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract 
historically  the company pays an annual dividend in the fourth quarter of each year  and the company paid a 
per common share dividend or  to shareholders of record as of december  the most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations see item a 
risk factors in this annual report of form k 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements with independent truck owner operators for use of their equipment and driver services on a month to month basis 
in addition  the company has entered into certain lease and terminal access contracts in order to provide tank storage and dock access for its crude oil marketing business 
such contracts require certain minimum monthly payments for the term of the contracts 
all operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
as of december   rental commitments under long term non cancelable operating leases and terminal arrangements for the next five years are payable as follows  and  thereafter 
contractual cash obligations the company has no capital lease obligations 
the company has entered into certain operating lease arrangements and terminal access agreements for tankage  truck tractors  trailers and office space 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual cash obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total lease payments in addition to its lease obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas insurance from time to time  the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are workers compensation  automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during each of  and  insurance costs were consistent with activity and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
insurance cost may experience rate increases during subject to market conditions 
since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these entities possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service as well as for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value and such contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for  and the company elects  cash flow hedge accounting 
the company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during  and the company utilizes a market approach to valuing its commodity contracts 
on a contract by contract  forward month by forward month basis  the company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts that typically have durations of less than months 
as of december   all of the company s market value measurements were based on either quoted prices in active markets level inputs or from inputs based on observable market data level inputs 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s fair value contracts give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with the company s risk management policies 
such policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given management s objectives  strategies and current market conditions 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of accounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to the volume of and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and natural gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of these estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data  reservoir engineering data  the pricing assumptions utilized as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
calculations of estimated future oil and natural gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and natural gas production  and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s calculations assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation  political conditions  economic conditions  weather conditions  market uncertainty  and other factors  impact the market price for oil and natural gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and natural gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing oil and natural gas properties 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the appropriate accounting literature guidelines 
revenue recognition the company s crude oil  natural gas and refined products marketing customers are invoiced daily or monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its commodity activities 
see discussion under revenue recognition policy in note to the consolidated financial statements 
transportation segment customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and natural gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and natural gas passes to the purchaser 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 which further amends the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the accounting standards codification 
among other provisions  asu expands and modifies certain principles and requirements for measuring fair value and disclosing fair value measurement information 
the company adopted asu effective january  and the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  but additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements resulted 
in december  the fasb issued asu this update requires additional disclosures about an entity s right of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial and derivative instruments 
the asu requires a tabular presentation that reflects the gross  net and setoff amounts associated with such assets and liabilities among other requirements 
the expanded disclosure requirements are effective for the annual reporting periods beginning on january  the company s adoption of asu is not expected to result in significant additional disclosures 
management believes the impact of other recently issued standards and updates  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had no long term debt outstanding at december  and a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to eighteen month term with no contracts extending longer than two years in duration 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the fair value of such contracts is reflected in the balance sheet as fair value assets and liabilities and any revaluation is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas sales have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
from january  through december   natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly average low of per mmbtu to a monthly average high of per mmbtu 
crude oil prices ranged from a monthly average low of per barrel to a monthly average high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  for the comparative years ended december  and  respectively
