item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that develops novel drugs 
our lead drug candidate is called remoxy 
remoxy is a strong painkiller with a unique formulation designed to reduce potential risks of unintended use 
remoxy and three other abuse resistant painkillers are being developed pursuant to a strategic alliance we have with pfizer under the pfizer agreements 
pfizer acquired king in early  and references in this section to pfizer include a reference to king 
we expect remoxy will be commercialized within pfizer s primary care unit 
we believe pfizer s acquisition of king may facilitate remoxy s commercial success  if approved by the fda 
we and king jointly managed a phase iii clinical program and nda submission for remoxy 
in mid  the fda accepted our nda for remoxy with priority review 
in december  we received from the fda a complete response letter for the nda for remoxy 
in this complete response letter  the fda indicated additional non clinical data was required to support the approval of remoxy 
also  the fda did not request or recommend additional clinical efficacy studies prior to approval 
in  king assumed sole responsibility for the regulatory approval of remoxy 
this shift of responsibility did not change any economic term of the king agreements 
in december  king resubmitted the remoxy nda 
in january  we announced that the fda had accepted the resubmission of the remoxy nda 
in june  we and pfizer announced that king received a complete response letter from the fda in response to king s resubmission of the remoxy nda 
the fda s complete response letter raised concerns related to  among other matters  the chemistry  manufacturing  and controls section of the nda for remoxy 
sufficient information does not yet exist to accurately assess the time required to resolve the concerns raised in the fda s complete response letter 
pfizer recently announced that it plans to meet with the fda in march to discuss remoxy 
we have received the following program fee and milestone payments under the pfizer agreements description year received amount received mm upfront program fee payment program fee payment related to an amendment to the strategic alliance milestone payments related to acceptance by the fda of the nda for remoxy acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant oxymorphone acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant hydrocodone acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant hydromorphone we will receive a million cash milestone payment from pfizer upon regulatory approval of remoxy in the united states 
we could also receive from pfizer up to million in additional milestone payments in the course of clinical development of the other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  pfizer is obligated to fund development expenses incurred by us pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
pfizer is obligated to fund the commercialization expenses of  and has the exclusive right to market and sell  drugs developed pursuant to the strategic alliance 
the royalty rate for net sales of remoxy and other products 
table of contents covered by the strategic alliance in the united states is  except as to the first billion in cumulative net sales in the united states  for which the royalty is 
the royalty rate for net sales of products covered by the strategic alliance outside the united states is 
pfizer is also obligated to reimburse us for our payment of third party royalty obligations related to this strategic alliance 
although we were profitable in  and based on payments received pursuant to the pfizer agreements and interest income  we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
we have recorded an accumulated deficit of million at december  these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  salaries and other personnel related costs and general corporate expenses 
research and development activities include costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our drug candidates 
salaries and other personnel related costs include non cash stock based compensation associated with options and other equity awards granted to employees and non employees 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of preclinical activities  enrollment rates of clinical trials for our drug candidates and our need for clinical supplies 
we expect to continue to use significant cash resources in our operations for the next several years 
our cash requirements for operating activities and capital expenditures may increase substantially in the future as we conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our drug candidates 
if our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our drug candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our drugs and or  if we license our drugs to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from sales of licensed products 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
we rely on arrangements with universities  our collaborators  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
we focus substantially all our research and development efforts on research and development in the areas of neurology  oncology and hematology 
the following table summarizes expenses by category for research and development efforts in thousands years ended december  compensation contractor fees and supplies other common costs contractor fees and supplies generally include expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials and costs for formulation and manufacturing activities 
other common costs includes the allocation of common costs such as facilities 

table of contents our technology has been applied across certain of our portfolio of drug candidates 
data  know how  personnel  clinical results  research results and other matters related to the research and development of any one of our drug candidates also relate to  and further the development of  our other drug candidates 
for example  we expect that results of non clinical studies  such as pharmacokinetics  toxicology and other studies  regarding certain components of our drug candidate remoxy to be applicable to the other potential drug candidates that may arise out of our strategic alliance with pfizer since all such potential drug candidates are expected to utilize such components 
as a result  costs allocated to a specific drug candidate may not necessarily reflect the actual costs surrounding research and development of that drug candidate due to cross application of the foregoing 
our contractor fees and supplies expenses in related to programs outside of the strategic alliance with pfizer were approximately million 
estimating the dates of completion of clinical development  and the costs to complete development  of our drug candidates would be highly speculative  subjective and potentially misleading 
pharmaceutical products take a significant amount of time to research  develop and commercialize 
the clinical trial portion of the development of a new drug alone usually spans several years 
we expect to reassess our future research and development plans based on our review of data we receive from our current research and development activities 
the cost and pace of our future research and development activities are linked and subject to change 
in december  we paid our stockholders a special non dividend distribution of per share  totaling million 
on december   a purported class action was filed against us and our executive officers in the us district court for the western district of texas 
this complaint alleges  among other things  violations of section b  rule b  and section a of the exchange act arising out of allegedly untrue or misleading statements of material facts made by us regarding remoxy s development and regulatory status during the purported class period  february  through june  the complaint states that monetary damages are being sought  but no amounts are specified 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and interest income in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those estimates related to agreements  research collaborations and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following items in our financial statements require significant estimates and judgments stock based compensation 
we recognize expense in the statement of operations for the fair value of all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options and other share based awards 
for stock options  we use the black scholes option valuation model and the single option award approach and straight line attribution method 
using this approach  the compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each respective stock option  generally four years 
we have granted share based awards that vest upon achievement of certain performance criteria  or performance awards 
the value of these awards is the product of the number of shares of our common stock to be issued under the award multiplied by the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant 
these awards include future performance conditions 
we estimate an implicit service period for achieving these performance conditions 
performance awards vest and common stock 
table of contents is issued on achieving performance conditions 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for performance awards when we conclude that achieving a performance condition is probable 
we periodically review and update as appropriate our estimates of the implicit service periods and the likelihood of achieving the performance conditions 
revenue recognition and deferred program fee revenue 
we recognize program fee revenue  collaboration revenue and milestone revenue in connection with our strategic alliance with pfizer 
program fee revenue is derived from upfront payments under the pfizer agreements  including the million paid to us at the beginning of the strategic alliance and the million we received in july in connection with an amendment the pfizer agreements 
these payments are recognized from receipt ratably over our estimate of the development period for the fourth of four drug candidates expected to be developed under the strategic alliance with pfizer 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to end in the quarter ended march  we review the estimated development period on a quarterly basis and change it if appropriate based upon our latest expectations 
in the fourth quarter of we determined that our estimate of the development period should be extended from the third quarter of to the first quarter of deferred program fee revenue represents the amount of the upfront payment that has not yet been recognized as program fee revenue 
as a result of the change in estimate in the fourth quarter of  program fee revenue was million lower in collaboration revenues from reimbursement of development expenses pursuant to our collaboration agreement with pfizer are generally recognized when pfizer has completed its review of the expenses invoiced to them 
pfizer is obligated to pay us milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of certain substantive events in the development of remoxy and the other opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
we recognize milestone payments from pfizer as revenue when we achieve the underlying developmental milestone as the milestone payments are not dependent upon any other future activities or achievement of any other future milestones and the achievement of each of the developmental milestones were substantively at risk and contingent at the effective date of the collaboration 
substantial effort is involved in achieving each of the developmental milestones 
these milestones represent the culmination of discrete earnings processes and the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation with the level of effort associated with the achievement of the milestone 
each milestone payment is non refundable and non creditable when made 
the ongoing research and development services being provided to pfizer under the collaboration are priced at fair value based upon the reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the collaboration with pfizer 
taxes 
we make estimates and judgments in determining the need for a provision for income taxes  including the estimation of our taxable income or loss for each full fiscal year 
we have accumulated significant deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain as to the timing and amount of any future earnings 
accordingly  we offset these net deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
we may in the future determine that more of our deferred tax assets will likely be realized  in which case we will reduce our valuation allowance in the quarter in which such determination is made 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  we may recognize a benefit from income taxes in our statement of operations in that period 
we classify interest recognized in connection with our tax positions as interest expense  when appropriate 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue program fee revenue we received a million upfront fee in in connection with the closing of the pfizer agreements and million in july in connection with an amendment to the pfizer agreements 
revenues recognized 
table of contents from amortization of upfront fees were million in and million in we expect to recognize the rest of the program fee ratably over our estimate of the remainder of the development period under the strategic alliance with pfizer 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to extend through march revenue collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million in and million in these revenues related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the pfizer agreements 
collaboration revenues were lower in as compared to primarily because the reimbursement of expenses we incurred pursuant to the pfizer agreements was lower in as compared to we expect the amount and timing of collaboration revenue to fluctuate in relation to the amount and timing of the underlying research and development expenses  as well as the timing of completion of pfizer s review of submitted expenses 
we incurred million of expenses in that continue to be subject to pfizer s review as of december  we expect pfizer will reimburse us for these expenses in research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of development work associated with our drug candidates 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower headcount and facilities related costs 
research and development expenses included million in non cash stock related compensation expense in including million related to the nondividend distribution in december and million in we expect non cash stock related compensation expense to decrease in we expect research and development expenses to fluctuate over the next several years as we continue our development efforts 
we expect our development efforts to result in our drug candidates progressing through various stages of clinical trials 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher non cash stock related compensation expense  offset in part by lower headcount and facilities related costs 
general and administrative expenses included million in non cash stock related compensation expense in including million related to the nondividend distribution in december and million in we expect non cash stock related compensation costs to decrease in we expect other general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years in connection with support of precommercialization and commercialization activities for our drug candidates 
the increase may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased to million in from million in we expect our interest income to decrease in the future as we use cash to fund our operations 
provision for income taxes we did not provide for federal income taxes in or because we had a tax loss for both and 
table of contents years ended december  and revenue program fee revenue we received a million upfront fee in in connection with the closing of the pfizer agreements and million in july in connection with an amendment to the pfizer agreements 
revenues recognized from amortization of upfront fees were million in and million in revenue collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million in and million in these revenues related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the pfizer agreements 
collaboration revenues were lower in as compared to primarily because the reimbursable expenses we incurred pursuant to the pfizer agreements were lower in as compared to revenue milestone revenue milestone revenue of million in was related to acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant oxymorphone under the pfizer agreements 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
in october  we were awarded million in research grants by the us government under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
the research grants were awarded following a competitive review of thousands of applications 
according to guidance released by the us department of the treasury  the us department of health and human services evaluated each project for its potential to produce new therapies  reduce long term health care costs or cure cancer 
we recognized these grants as a reduction in research and development expenses for the fourth quarter research and development expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in non cash stock related compensation costs as well as the timing of development activities for our product candidates  offset in part by the reduction in research and development costs in for grants awarded to us by the us government 
research and development expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million in and million in these costs in included million for modifications made to outstanding stock options to prevent diminution of the benefit of these options from the special nondividend distribution to stockholders in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased non cash stock related compensation costs in as compared to 
table of contents general and administrative expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million in and million in these costs in included million for modifications made to outstanding stock options to prevent diminution of the benefit of these options from the special nondividend distribution to stockholders in the fourth quarter of interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased average balances of marketable securities 
provision for income taxes we did not provide for federal income taxes in or because we had a tax loss for both and liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private stock offerings  payments received under the pfizer agreements and interest earned on our investments 
we intend to continue to use our capital resources to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for and million for in  we collected million from receivables at december  net cash provided by investing activities was million for compared to million for investing activities for both years consisted primarily of the purchase  sale and maturities of marketable securities 
we did not use any cash to purchase property  equipment and leasehold improvements in and net cash used by financing activities was million for and cash provided by financing activities was million for in december  we paid our stockholders million in a special non dividend distribution of per share 
other cash used in financing activities in consisted of million in cash used to pay statutory taxes on performance awards that were exercised net of taxes  offset in part by million received from stock option exercises 
other cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of cash from stock option exercises 
we expect cash used to pay for statutory taxes on stock options and performance awards may increase in the future 
realization of our other deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain about the timing and amount of any future earnings 
accordingly  we offset these net deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
we currently lease approximately  square feet of office space pursuant to a non cancelable operating lease in austin  tx that expires in future minimum lease payments by year are as follows in thousands total future minimum lease payments we have license agreements that require us to make milestone payments upon the successful achievement of milestones  including clinical milestones 
our license agreements also require us to pay certain royalties to our 
table of contents licensors if we succeed in fully commercializing products under these license agreements 
all of these potential future payments are cancelable as of december  our formulation agreement with durect corporation obligates us to make certain milestone payments upon achieving clinical milestones and regulatory milestones 
pfizer is obligated to reimburse us for any of our milestone payments and royalty payments to durect corporation 
we have an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect our cash requirements to be significant in the future 
the amount and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our drug candidates and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by an immaterial amount 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
we have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments 
as of december   our investments consisted of investments in corporate notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable market rates of interest 
we believe our credit risk is immaterial
