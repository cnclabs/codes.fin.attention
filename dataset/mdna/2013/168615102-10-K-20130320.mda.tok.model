furthermore  while it is our intention to repurchase our stock and pay a quarterly cash dividend in the future  any determination to repurchase our stock or pay future dividends will be made by the board of directors and will depend on our stock price  future earnings  financial condition  and other factors established by the board 
our ongoing capital requirements will continue to be primarily for enhancing and expanding our omni channel capabilities  including new  expanded  relocated and remodeled stores  information technology  and other central support facilities

we also expect to complete approximately relocations or expansions in addition to converting approximately soma pop up stores to permanent stores 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions require or as opportunities arise 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at february  total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases purchase orders capital expenditures total as of february   our contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases  open purchase orders for inventory  in the normal course of business  which are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date and contractual commitments for fiscal capital expenditures 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the relevant taxing authorities  we are unable to estimate a final determination related to our uncertain tax positions and therefore  we have excluded the uncertain tax positions  totaling million at february  from the above table 
credit facility on july   we entered into a million senior five year unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent and hsbc bank usa  national association  as syndication agent 

table of contents the credit facility provides a million revolving credit facility that matures on july  the credit facility provides for swing advances of up to million and issuance of letters of credit up to million 
the credit facility also contains a feature that provides the company the ability  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  to expand the commitments available under the credit facility from million up to million 
as of february   no borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains standard affirmative and negative covenants and other limitations subject to various carve outs regarding the company 
the covenants limit a the making of investments  the payment of dividends and other payments with respect to capital  the disposition of material assets other than in the ordinary course of business  and mergers and acquisitions under certain conditions  b transactions with affiliates unless such transactions are completed in the ordinary course of business and upon fair and reasonable terms  c the incurrence of liens and indebtedness  and d certain substantial changes in the nature of the subsidiaries business 
the credit facility contains customary financial covenants for unsecured credit facilities  consisting of a maximum total debt leverage ratio that cannot be greater than to and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that cannot be less than to 
the credit facility contains customary events of default 
if a default occurs and is not cured within any applicable cure period or is not waived  the company s obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated or the credit facility may be terminated 
the company was in compliance with the applicable ratio requirements and other covenants at february  off balance sheet arrangements at february  and january   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and believes the following assumptions and estimates are significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 
inventory valuation and shrinkage we identify potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with our overall sales trend 
excess quantities of inventory are identified through evaluation of inventory aging  review of inventory turns and historical sales experience  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in current business trends 
we provide lower of cost or market adjustments for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
historically  the variation of those estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 

table of contents we estimate our expected shrinkage of inventories between our physical inventory counts by using average store shrinkage experience rates  which are updated on a regular basis 
historically  the variation of those estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 
revenue recognition retail sales at our stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons  promotional discounts and associate discounts 
we record sales from our websites and catalogs based on the estimated receipt date of the product by our customers 
under our current program  gift cards do not have expiration dates 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time the gift card is sold 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for gift cards upon redemption 
in addition  we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards based on determining that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions commonly referred to as gift card breakage 
we recognize gift card breakage under the redemption recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on our historical gift card breakage rate 
we determine the gift card breakage rate based on our historical redemption patterns 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns related to store and website sales 
to account for the financial impact of potential customer merchandise returns  we estimate future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 
evaluation of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is estimated using estimated future cash flows of the asset discounted by a rate commensurate with the risk involved with such asset while incorporating marketplace assumptions 
the estimate of future cash flows requires management to make certain assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and the useful lives of the assets 
we exercise our best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding our business when applying these impairment rules 
we establish our assumptions and arrive at the estimates used in these calculations based upon our historical experience  knowledge of the retail industry and by incorporating third party data  which we believe results in a reasonably accurate approximation of fair value 
nevertheless  changes in the assumptions used could have an impact on our assessment of recoverability 
we review our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the appropriateness of performing a qualitative assessment  on a reporting unit level  based on current circumstances 
if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the two step impairment test will be performed 
if we conclude that this is not the case  then the two step impairment test will not be required 
we may elect to skip the qualitative assessment and perform the two step impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amounts  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 

table of contents operating leases rent expense under store operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
landlord incentives  rent free periods  rent escalation clauses and other rental expenses are also amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  which includes the construction period  which is generally days prior to the store opening date when we generally begin improvements in preparation for our intended use 
tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit within deferred liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease  which includes the construction period and one renewal when there is a significant economic cost associated with non renewal 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and published guidance as applicable to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets  since management anticipates that the full amount of these assets should be realized in the future 
our effective tax rate considers management s judgment of expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
we record amounts for uncertain tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
consequently  changes in our assumptions and judgments could materially affect amounts recognized related to income tax uncertainties and may affect our results of operations or financial position 
we believe our assumptions for estimates continue to be reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of such tax positions 
historically  the variation of estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense for all awards is based on the grant date fair value of the award  net of estimated forfeitures  and is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards and stock options with a service condition is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
compensation expense for performance based awards is recognized ratably for each vesting tranche based on our estimate of the level and likelihood of meeting certain company specific performance goals 
the calculation of stock based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment 
we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate for all stock based awards  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
in determining the portion of the stock based payment award that is ultimately expected to be earned  we derive forfeiture rates based on historical data 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  we revise our forfeiture rates  when necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated 
as a result  in the event that a grant s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate at the completion of the vesting period  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we recorded in current and prior periods 
for stock option awards  estimates include the expected volatility and expected term  which are utilized in calculating the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under our stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
no stock option awards were granted during fiscal for performance based awards  these estimates include the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued based on the likelihood of meeting the respective performance condition 
we estimate the probable vesting based on current financial performance forecasts for the relevant performance metrics 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
historically  the variation of estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this guidance provides companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired and whether it is necessary to perform an annual quantitative impairment test

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk of our financial instruments as of february  has not significantly changed since january  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and our marketable securities 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to our revolving line of credit with our bank 
however  as of february   we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our line of credit and  given our current liquidity position  do not expect to utilize our line of credit in the foreseeable future 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
our investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities including municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us government and agency securities 
the portfolio as of february   consisted of million of securities with maturity dates within one year or less and million with maturity dates over one year and less than or equal to two years 
we consider all securities available for sale  including those with maturity dates beyond months  and therefore classify these securities as short term investments within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as they are available to support current operational liquidity needs 
as of february   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates would increase the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million
