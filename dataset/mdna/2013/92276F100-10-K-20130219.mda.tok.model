item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of ventas  inc together with its subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires  we  us or our 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis will help you understand who we are and the environment in which we operate  our highlights  our critical accounting policies and estimates  our results of operations for the last three years  how we manage our assets and liabilities  our liquidity and capital resources  our cash flows  and our future contractual obligations 
corporate and operating environment we are a real estate investment trust reit with a highly diversified portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties located throughout the united states and canada 
as of december   we owned more than  properties  including seniors housing communities  skilled nursing and other facilities  medical office buildings mobs  and hospitals  in states  the district of columbia and two canadian provinces  and we had three new properties under development 
we are an s p company and currently headquartered in chicago  illinois 
we primarily acquire and own seniors housing and healthcare properties and lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third party managers 
as of december   we leased properties excluding mobs and properties classified as held for sale to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property related expenses  including maintenance  utilities  repairs  taxes  insurance and capital expenditures  and we engaged independent operators  such as atria senior living  inc atria and sunrise senior living  llc formerly sunrise senior living  inc and  together with its subsidiaries  sunrise  to manage of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long term management agreements 
kindred healthcare  inc together with its subsidiaries  kindred and brookdale senior living inc together with its subsidiaries  brookdale senior living leased from us properties and properties excluding six properties included in investments in unconsolidated entities and properties classified as held for sale  respectively  as of december  in addition  through our lillibridge healthcare services  inc lillibridge subsidiary and our ownership interest in pmb real estate services llc pmbres  we provide mob management  leasing  marketing  facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the united states 
from time to time  we also make secured and unsecured loans and other investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare operators or properties 
we conduct our operations through three reportable business segments triple net leased properties  senior living operations  and mob operations 
see note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
as of december   we had ownership interests in  properties  controlling interests in mobs  seniors housing communities  nine skilled nursing facilities and one hospital owned through consolidated joint ventures  and ownership interests ranging between and in mobs  seniors housing communities and skilled nursing facilities through investments in unconsolidated entities 
through lillibridge and pmbres  we also provided management and leasing services to third parties with respect to mobs as of december  our principal objective is to enhance shareholder value by delivering superior  reliable returns 
to achieve this objective  we pursue a business strategy of generating consistent  reliable and growing cash flows  maintaining a balanced  well diversified portfolio of high quality assets  and preserving our financial strength  flexibility and liquidity 
our ability to access capital in a timely and cost effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations  including the repayment of maturing indebtedness  and to make future investments 
our access to and cost of external capital are dependent on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our securities  expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions  and the trading price of our common stock 
generally  we attempt to match the long term duration of our investments in senior housing and healthcare properties with long term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long term fixed rate debt 
at december   approximately of our consolidated debt excluding debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale was variable rate debt 
highlights during the year ended december  we completed billion of gross investments  including the acquisitions of cogdell spencer inc cogdell  with its real estate assets including properties owned through joint ventures and its mob property management business  for an investment of approximately million  including debt  seniors housing communities managed by sunrise the sunrise managed communities for approximately million  of various private investment funds the funds previously managed by lazard fr res real estate investors llc or its affiliates lfrei  which funds own a interest in atria and million shares of our common stock  and controlling interests in mobs that that we previously accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities  we sold properties and received final repayment on loans receivable and marketable debt securities for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  including certain fees  and recognized a net gain of million from the dispositions  we paid an annual cash dividend on our common stock of per share  which represents an increase over the prior year and was paid to stockholders in equal quarterly installments of per share  we issued and sold billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and entered into a new million term loan  collectively having a weighted average stated interest rate of and a weighted average maturity at the time of issuance of years  we completed a public offering and sale of  shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of million  of the properties leased to kindred whose current lease term expires on april   kindred renewed or entered into a new lease with respect to a total of properties  and we entered into new leases or sale contracts for the remaining properties  the majority of which remain subject to operating transitions and regulatory approvals  and we redeemed or repaid million aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt  including our senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  and unsecured term loan due  and million of mortgage debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap set forth in the accounting standards codification asc  as published by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different  we may have applied a different accounting treatment  resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
we periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions  and in the event they prove to be different from actual results  we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described below  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  see note accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation  and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
gaap requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies 
a vie is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics a the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support  b as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack i the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting or similar rights  ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or c the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests  and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve  or are conducted on behalf of  an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we may change our original assessment of a vie due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity s equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary 
we identify the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could be significant to the entity 
we perform this analysis on an ongoing basis 
as it relates to investments in joint ventures  based on the type of rights held by the limited partner s  gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances in which the general partner would otherwise consolidate the joint venture 
we assess limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner when an investor becomes the sole general partner  and we reassess if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners  ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests  or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests 
we also apply this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies 
business combinations we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and allocate the cost of the businesses acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
recognized intangibles primarily include the value of in place leases  acquired lease contracts  tenant and customer relationships  trade names trademarks and goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business and is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our method for allocating the purchase price to acquired investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this includes determining the value of the buildings  land and improvements  construction in progress  ground leases  tenant improvements  in place leases  above and or below market leases  purchase option intangible assets and or liabilities  and any debt assumed 
these estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations  as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives 
in addition  we amortize the value assigned to above and or below market leases as a component of revenue  unlike in place leases and other intangibles  which we include in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income 
we estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as if vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building  not to exceed years 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets  such as site improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment  based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date 
we determine the value of land either by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio 
we generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost 
however  for certain acquired properties that are part of a ground up development  we determine fair value by using the same valuation approach as for all other properties and deducting the estimated cost to complete the development 
during the remaining construction period  we capitalize interest expense until the development has reached substantial completion 
construction in progress  including capitalized interest  is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion 
the fair value of acquired lease related intangibles  if any  reflects i the estimated value of any above and or below market leases  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and the in place lease rent  and ii the estimated value of in place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants  including leasing commissions  and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period as if the acquired space was vacant 
we amortize any acquired lease related intangibles to revenue or amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any assumed bargain renewal periods 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed upon expiration  we recognize all unamortized lease related intangibles associated with that lease in operations at that time 
we estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets and liabilities by discounting the difference between the applicable property s acquisition date fair value and an estimate of the future option price 
we do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease  but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon sale 
we estimate the fair value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired  if any  by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant or customer  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant or customer  the tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with the tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant  and we amortize that value over the expected life of the associated arrangements or leases  including the remaining terms of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
we estimate the fair value of trade names trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize that value over the estimated useful life of the trade name trademark 
in connection with a business combination  we may assume rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property 
we assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement 
all of our assumed capital leases contain bargain purchase options that we intend to exercise 
therefore  we recognized real estate assets based on the acquisition date fair values of the underlying properties and liabilities based on the acquisition date fair values of the capital lease obligations 
we depreciate assets recognized under capital leases that contain bargain purchase options over the assets respective useful lives 
lease payments are allocated between the reduction of the capital lease obligation and interest expense using the interest method 
we assess assumed operating leases  including ground leases  to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us given current market conditions on the acquisition date 
to the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable relative to market conditions on the acquisition date  we recognize an intangible asset or liability at fair value  and we amortize the recognized asset or liability excluding purchase option intangibles to interest or rental expense in our consolidated statements of income over the applicable lease term 
we include all lease related intangible assets and liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the fair value of loans receivable acquired in connection with a business combination by discounting the estimated future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities and same terms would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings 
the estimated future cash flows reflect our judgment regarding the uncertainty of those cash flows  so we do not establish a valuation allowance at the acquisition date 
we recognize the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the total expected cash flows as interest income using an effective interest method over the life of the applicable loan 
subsequent to the acquisition date  we evaluate changes regarding the uncertainty of future cash flows and the need for a valuation allowance 
we estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed using assumptions that are consistent with those used in valuing all of the underlying assets and liabilities 
we base the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities on the fair value of the assets at the time we acquired the joint venture interest 
we estimate fair values for our equity method investments based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and  where applicable  any estimated debt premiums or discounts 
the capitalization rates  discount rates and credit spreads we use in these models are based upon assumptions that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments 
we generally amortize any difference between our cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and include that amortization in our share of income or loss from unconsolidated entities 
for earnings of equity method investments with pro rata distribution allocations  net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on their respective stated ownership percentages 
in other instances  net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on the hypothetical liquidation at book value method 
we calculate the fair value of long term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings  which we approximate based on the rate at which we would expect to incur to a replacement instrument on the date of acquisition  and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations 
in performing this evaluation  we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset 
we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows  including sales proceeds  is less than book value 
we recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination 
if impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives  we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  then we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare the estimated fair value to the intangible asset s carrying value 
we recognize any shortfall from carrying value as an impairment loss in the current period 
we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may exceed its fair value 
if we determine that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated entity is other than temporary  and if such reduced fair value is below the carrying value  we record an impairment 
the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated entities involves significant judgment 
our estimates consider all available evidence  including  as appropriate  the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates  general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if indicators arise 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
qualitative factors we assess include current macroeconomic conditions  state of the equity and capital markets and our overall financial and operating performance 
if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we proceed with the two step approach to evaluating impairment 
in the first step of this approach  we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  we proceed with the second step 
the second step of this approach requires us to assign the fair value of a reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment 
we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value in the current period 
estimates of fair value used in our evaluation of goodwill  investments in real estate and intangible assets are based upon discounted future cash flow projections or other acceptable valuation techniques  which are based  in turn  upon various estimates and assumptions  such as revenue and expense growth rates  capitalization rates  discount rates or other available market data 
our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 
loans receivable we record loans receivable  other than those acquired in connection with a business combination  on our consolidated balance sheets either in secured loans receivable  net or  with respect to unsecured loans receivable  other assets at the unpaid principal balance  net of any deferred origination fees  purchase discounts or premiums and valuation allowances 
we amortize net deferred origination fees  which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs  and purchase discounts or premiums over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method and immediately recognize in income any unamortized balances if the loan is repaid before its contractual maturity 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of loans receivable based on factors such as corporate and facility level financial and operational reports  compliance with financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan agreement  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantor  the payment history of the borrower and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the terms of the applicable loan agreement  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be collected 
fair value gaap defines fair value and provides direction for measuring fair value and making the necessary related disclosures 
gaap emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy 
level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access 
level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability 
level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as other inputs for the asset or liability  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates and yield curves  that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on our own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
if the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy  the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
if the volume and level of market activity for an asset or liability has decreased significantly relative to the normal market activity for such asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities  then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value 
in addition  if there is evidence that a transaction for an asset or liability is not orderly  little  if any  weight is placed on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
revenue recognition triple net leased properties and mob operations certain of our triple net leases  including a majority of the leases we acquired in connection with our acquisition of nationwide health properties  inc nhp  and most of our mob leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
we recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants  creating a straight line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
four of our five master lease agreements with kindred the kindred master leases and certain of our other leases provide for periodic increases in base rent only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases as the related parameters or contingencies are met  rather than on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
senior living operations we recognize resident fees and services  other than move in fees  monthly as services are provided 
we recognize move in fees on a straight line basis over the average resident stay 
our lease agreements with residents generally have a term of to months and are cancelable by the resident upon days notice 
other we recognize interest income from loans  including discounts and premiums  using the effective interest method when collectibility is reasonably assured 
we apply the effective interest method on a loan by loan basis and recognize discounts and premiums as yield adjustments over the related loan term 
we recognize interest income on an impaired loan to the extent our estimate of the fair value of the collateral is sufficient to support the balance of the loan  other receivables and all related accrued interest 
when the balance of the loan  other receivables and all related accrued interest is equal to our estimate of the fair value of the collateral  we recognize interest income on a cash basis 
we provide a reserve against an impaired loan to the extent our total investment in the loan exceeds our estimate of the fair value of the loan collateral 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees  development services  management advisory services  and all other income when all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin i the applicable agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances we assess the collectibility of our rent receivables  including straight line rent receivables  and we defer recognition of revenue if collectibility is not reasonably assured 
we base our assessment of the collectibility of rent receivables other than straight line rent receivables on several factors  including  among other things  payment history  the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered 
we base our assessment of the collectibility of straight line rent receivables on several factors  including  among other things  the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the property  the historical payment pattern of the tenant  and the type of property 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to receive the rent payments due in the future  we defer recognition of the straight line rental revenue and  in certain circumstances  provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight line rent receivable asset for the portion  up to its full value  that we estimate may not be recovered 
if we change our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease  we may adjust our reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue recognized and or to increase or reduce the reserve against the previously recognized straight line rent receivable asset 
federal income tax we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  for every year beginning with the year ended december  accordingly  provided that we continue to qualify as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on net income that we distribute to our stockholders 
however  with respect to certain of our subsidiaries that have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries  we record income tax expense or benefit  as those entities are subject to federal income tax similar to regular corporations 
we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances  and that causes us to change our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events  is included in the tax provision when such changes occur 
deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances  and that causes us to change our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset  is included in the tax provision when such changes occur 
recently issued or adopted accounting standards in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu  which amends asc topic  comprehensive income 
asu requires entities to present comprehensive income in either i one continuous financial statement or ii two separate but consecutive statements that display net income and the components of other comprehensive income 
totals and individual components of both net income and other comprehensive income must be included in either presentation 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no

the provisions of asu indefinitely defer portions of asu related to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we adopted the provisions of asu and asu on january  results of operations as of december   we operated through three reportable business segments triple net leased properties  senior living operations  and mob operations 
under our triple net leased properties segment  we acquire and own seniors housing and healthcare properties throughout the united states and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property related expenses 
under our senior living operations segment  we invest in seniors housing communities throughout the united states and canada and engage independent operators  such as atria and sunrise  to manage those communities 
under our mob operations segment  we primarily acquire  own  develop  lease  and manage mobs 
information provided for all other includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate level expenses not directly attributable to our three reportable business segments 
assets included in all other consist primarily of corporate assets  including cash  restricted cash  deferred financing costs  loans receivable and miscellaneous accounts receivable

therefore  occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants operations but do not have a direct impact on our revenues or financial results 
the following table sets forth average occupancy rates related to the triple net leased properties we owned at december  for the third quarter of which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants and average occupancy rates related to the triple net leased properties we owned at december  for the third quarter of number of properties at december  average occupancy for the trailing months ended september  number of properties at december  average occupancy for the trailing months ended september  seniors housing communities skilled nursing facilities hospitals excludes seniors housing communities and skilled nursing facilities included in investments in unconsolidated entities

our senior living operations segment revenues increased in over the prior year primarily due to the properties we acquired in may in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets and working capital of privately owned atria senior living group  inc together with its affiliates  aslg  the seniors housing communities we acquired in including the sunrise managed communities  and higher average unit occupancy rates and higher average monthly revenue per occupied room 
property level operating expenses related to our senior living operations segment include labor  food  utilities  marketing  management and other costs of operating the properties 
property level operating expenses increased year over year primarily due to the acquired properties described above and higher management fees and labor expenses at the sunrise managed communities we acquired in the original sunrise managed communities 
under our management agreements with respect to the original sunrise managed communities  the management fees paid to sunrise were temporarily reduced to of revenues generated by the applicable properties for  but reverted to their contractual level of of revenues generated by the applicable properties with a range of to for and subsequent years 
the management fees including incentive fees we paid pursuant to our sunrise management agreements in were equal to of revenues generated by the applicable properties

non gaap financial measures we believe that net income  as defined by gaap  is the most appropriate earnings measurement 
however  we consider certain non gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance 
a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measure 
set forth below are descriptions of the non gaap financial measures we use in evaluating our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors  as well as reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures we present in this annual report on form k may not be identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as measures of our liquidity  nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
however  since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider funds from operations ffo and normalized ffo to be appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity reit 
we also believe that normalized ffo provides useful information because it allows investors  analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and other events such as transactions and litigation 
in some cases  we provide information about identified non cash components of ffo and normalized ffo because it investors  allows analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items 
we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  including gain on re measurement of equity method investments  and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the following income and expense items which may be recurring in nature a net gains on real estate activity  b merger related costs and expenses  including amortization of intangibles and transition and integration expenses  and deal costs and expenses  including expenses and recoveries relating to our lawsuit against hcp  c the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances  the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees  or additional costs  expenses  discounts  make whole payments  penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt  d the non cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses  e the impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures including pursuant to tenant options to purchase and capital transactions  f the financial impact of contingent consideration  g charitable donations made to the ventas charitable foundation  and h gains and losses for non operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our ffo and normalized ffo for each of the five years ended december  are summarized in the following table 
our ffo for the year ended december  increased over the prior year primarily due to our billion of gross investments in  including our acquisitions of cogdell and the sunrise managed communities  and the full year benefit of our acquisitions  including nhp and aslg 
additionally  we benefited from excellent performance in our senior living operations reportable business segment  rental increases from our triple net lease portfolio and lower weighted average interest rates 
these benefits were partially offset by our receipt of million of net litigation proceeds in related to our lawsuit against hcp  increases in general and administrative expenses including stock based compensation  higher debt balances  a scheduled increase in the management fees with respect to the original sunrise managed communities  and asset sales and loan repayments during and for the year ended december  in thousands net income attributable to common stockholders adjustments real estate depreciation and amortization real estate depreciation related to noncontrolling interest real estate depreciation related to unconsolidated entities gain on re measurement of equity interest upon acquisition  net discontinued operations gain on real estate dispositions  net depreciation on real estate assets ffo adjustments litigation proceeds  net change in fair value of financial instruments reversal of contingent liability provision for loan losses income tax benefit expense loss gain on extinguishment of debt  net merger related expenses and deal costs amortization of other intangibles normalized ffo adjusted ebitda we consider adjusted ebitda to be an important supplemental measure to net income because it provides additional information with which to evaluate the performance of our operations and serves as another indication of our ability to service debt 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization including non cash stock based compensation expense  excluding net loss on extinguishment of debt  net litigation proceeds  merger related expenses and deal costs  net gains on real estate activity and changes in the fair value of financial instruments including amounts in discontinued operations

we define noi as total revenues  less interest and other income  property level operating expenses and medical office building services costs including amounts in discontinued operations 
cash receipts may differ due to straight line recognition of certain rental income and the application of other gaap policies 
the following is a reconciliation of noi to net income including amounts in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  in thousands net income adjustments interest and other income including amounts in discontinued operations interest including amounts in discontinued operations depreciation and amortization including amounts in discontinued operations general  administrative and professional fees including amounts in discontinued operations loss on extinguishment of debt  net litigation proceeds  net merger related expenses and deal costs other including amounts in discontinued operations income loss from unconsolidated entities income tax benefit expense including amounts in discontinued operations gain on real estate dispositions  net noi including amounts in discontinued operations discontinued operations noi excluding amounts in discontinued operations asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of our asset liability management process  which focuses on various risks such as market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk  is to support the achievement of our business strategy  while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loans  certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations  certain mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and marketable debt securities 
these market risks result primarily from changes in libor or prime rates 
we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of current and future economic conditions 
the table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt  excluding premiums  discounts and capital lease obligations 
as of december  dollars in thousands balance fixed rate senior notes and other mortgage loans and other variable rate unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured term loans mortgage loans total percent of total debt fixed rate senior notes and other mortgage loans and other variable rate unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured term loans mortgage loans total weighted average interest rate at end of period fixed rate senior notes and other mortgage loans and other variable rate unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured term loans n a mortgage loans total the amounts presented above exclude debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale as of december  and the total mortgage debt for these properties as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
the variable rate debt in the table above reflects  in part  the effect of i million notional amount of interest rate swaps that matured on february  and ii million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from march  to april   in each case that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the increase in our outstanding variable rate debt at december  compared to december  is primarily attributable to additional borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loans 
pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain variable rate debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
assuming a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt excluding debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale at december   and assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense for would increase  and our net income would decrease  by approximately million  or per diluted common share 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings 
as of december  and  our joint venture and operating partners aggregate share of total debt was million and million  respectively  with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures and an operating partnership 
total debt does not include our portion of debt related to investments in unconsolidated entities  which was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in debt related to investments in unconsolidated entities is the result of our august acquisition of the controlling interests in mobs 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally affect the fair value  but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until such obligations mature or until we elect to prepay and refinance such obligations 
if interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures or is refinanced  our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs 
conversely  lower interest rates at the time of maturity or refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs 
to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and as of december  in thousands gross book value fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of our fixed rate debt was due primarily to overall changes in interest rates and a net increase in the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes 
as of december   the fair value of our secured and unsecured loans receivable  based on our estimates of currently prevailing interest rates for comparable loans  was million 
see note loans receivable and note fair values of financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we are subject to fluctuations in us and canadian currency exchange rates that may  from time to time  affect our financial condition and results of operations 
increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our seniors housing communities in canada 
based solely on our results  if the canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease by  our net income from these communities would decrease or increase  as applicable  by less than million per year 
if we increase our international presence through investments in  or acquisitions or development of  seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states  we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility in currencies other than us or canadian dollars 
although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives including additional borrowings in local currencies to protect against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  our ability to service our indebtedness or our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit a material adverse effect 
in the future  we may engage in hedging strategies to manage our exposure to market risk  depending on an analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies 
however  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
concentration and credit risk we use concentration ratios to understand and evaluate the potential risks of economic downturns or other adverse events affecting our asset types  geographic locations  business models  and tenants  operators and managers 
we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix 
investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant  operator or manager 
operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant  operator or manager  geographic location or business model 
the following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented as of december  investment mix by asset type seniors housing communities skilled nursing and other facilities mobs hospitals loans receivable  net investment mix by tenant  operator and manager atria sunrise brookdale senior living kindred all other ratios are based on the gross book value of real estate investments excluding assets classified as held for sale as of each reporting date

see non gaap financial measures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional disclosure and reconciliations of adjusted ebitda and noi to our net income as computed in accordance with gaap 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing certain of our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the consumer price index cpi  with caps  floors or collars 
we also earn revenue from individual residents at our seniors housing communities managed by independent operators  such as atria and sunrise  and tenants in our mobs 
for the year ended december   of our adjusted ebitda including amounts in discontinued operations was derived from our senior living operations and mob operations  for which rental rates may fluctuate more frequently upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions 
our reliance on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our total revenues and noi creates credit risk 
our financial condition and results of operations could be weakened and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be limited if either kindred or brookdale senior living becomes unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us 
we cannot assure you that either kindred or brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets  income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its respective obligations to us  and any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to do so could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  any failure by either kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation or its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties  which could have an indirect material adverse effect on us 
see risk factors risks arising from our business we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income  any inability or unwillingness by kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we regularly monitor the relative credit risk of our significant tenants  and changes therein  particularly when those tenants have recourse obligations under their triple net leases 
the ratios and metrics we use to evaluate a significant tenant s liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and the industry or industries in which it operates  including without limitation the tenant s credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant  its operations and the markets in which the tenant operates  that may vary over time 
among other things  we may i review and analyze information regarding the real estate  seniors housing and healthcare industries generally  publicly available information regarding the significant tenant  and information required to be provided by the tenant under the terms of its lease agreements with us  ii examine monthly and or quarterly financial statements of the significant tenant to the extent publicly available or otherwise provided under the terms of our lease agreements  and iii participate in periodic discussions and in person meetings with representatives of the significant tenant 
from this data  we endeavor to calculate multiple financial ratios which may  but do not necessarily  include net debt to ebitdar or ebitdarm  fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth  after making certain adjustments based on our judgment  and to assess other metrics we deem relevant to an understanding of the significant tenant s credit risk 
because atria and sunrise manage  but do not lease  our properties  we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple net tenants 
however  we rely on our managers personnel  expertise  technical resources and information systems  proprietary information  good faith and judgment to manage our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively 
we also rely on our managers to set resident fees and otherwise operate those properties in compliance with the terms of our management agreements 
although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements  including various rights to terminate and exercise remedies under the agreements that may relate to all properties or a specific property or group of properties as provided therein  atria s or sunrise s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under those agreements  to efficiently and effectively manage our properties or to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  significant changes in atria s or sunrise s senior management or any adverse developments in their businesses and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us 
see risk factors risks arising from our business the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income  although atria and sunrise are managers  not tenants  of our properties  adverse developments in their businesses and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us and we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances  and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
in december  we acquired a ownership interest in atria through the acquisition of the funds previously managed by lfrei 
as a result  we obtained certain rights and minority protections regarding material transactions affecting atria  as well as the right to appoint two directors to the atria board of directors 
in august  sunrise announced that it had agreed to be acquired by health care reit  inc health care reit 
in connection with this announcement  sunrise effected an internal reorganization to separate its subsidiaries that operate and manage seniors housing communities collectively  the sunrise management business from its real estate assets and its equity interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures that hold real estate assets collectively  the sunrise real estate

triple net lease expirations as our triple net leases expire  we face the risk that our tenants may elect not to renew those leases and  in the event of non renewal  we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms  if at all 
during the year ended december   we had no triple net lease renewals or expirations without renewal that had a material effect on our financial condition or our results of operations for that period 
the following table summarizes our triple net lease expirations currently scheduled to occur over the next ten years excluding leases related to assets classified as held for sale as of december  number of properties annual rental income of total triple net rental income dollars in thousands the non renewal of some or all of our triple net leases could have a material adverse effect on us

as of december   we leased properties to kindred pursuant to four original kindred master leases  with the properties grouped into bundles or renewal groups each  a renewal group containing a varying number of properties 
each renewal group is diversified by geography and contains at least one long term acute care hospital 
under the four original kindred master leases  the properties within a single renewal group have the same primary lease term of ten to years which commenced may   and each renewal group is subject to three successive five year renewal terms at kindred s option  provided certain conditions are satisfied 
kindred s renewal option is all or nothing with respect to the properties contained in each renewal group 
the lease terms for ten renewal groups under the four original kindred master leases covering a total of properties have an april  expiration date 
we have entered into lease renewals  new leases or sale contracts for all properties whose lease term expires on april  we expect cash revenue and noi from these properties including yield on reinvested sale proceeds from the five properties for sale to be million  compared to rent for all properties of million 
of these properties  kindred will remain the tenant in properties for estimated aggregate annual base rent commencing on may  of million  including escalations 
specifically  kindred irrevocably renewed for a five year term three renewal groups covering a total of properties  and we entered into a fifth kindred master lease with respect to ten long term acute care hospitals 
the new kindred master lease has an initial term expiring on april  and is subject to three successive five year  all or nothing renewal options at kindred s option 
with respect to the remaining skilled nursing facilities whose lease term expires on april  the marketed assets  marketed assets have been leased pursuant to new long term triple net leases the new leases with seven qualified healthcare operators the new tenants  and we have entered into definitive agreements to sell five marketed assets 
the new leases have an average weighted initial lease term of over years 
six of the marketed assets transitioned to new tenants on february  kindred is required to continue to perform all of its obligations under the applicable kindred master lease for the marketed assets until expiration of the current lease term  including without limitation  payment of all rental amounts 
moreover  we own or have the rights to all licenses and cons at the properties  and kindred has extensive and detailed obligations to cooperate and ensure an orderly transition of the properties to another operator 
although leases and sale contracts have been executed and we expect the remaining transitions and sales to be completed or occur in the first half of  these transitions and sales remain subject to customary closing conditions  including licensure and regulatory approval 
accordingly  we cannot assure you as to whether or when the transitions or sales of the remaining marketed assets will be completed  if at all  or upon what terms 
our ability to transition or sell the marketed assets could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing  con or other laws  as well as by the medicare and medicaid change of ownership rules  and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing or change of ownership proceedings 
in addition  if any transition or sale has not occurred by may   kindred has certain obligations to continue operating the properties on modified terms for a limited period  but we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses or general operating expenses related to the applicable properties after may  the current lease term for ten renewal groups covering another properties leased to kindred pursuant to the original four kindred master leases will expire on april  the assets  subject to two successive five year renewal options for those properties exercisable by kindred 
kindred has from november  until april  to provide us with renewal notices with respect to those properties 
therefore  as to any renewal group for which we do not receive a renewal notice  we will have at least one year to arrange for the repositioning of the applicable properties with new operators 
regardless of whether kindred renews any of the renewal groups  kindred is obligated to continue to perform all of its obligations under the applicable master leases with respect to the assets  including the payment of full rent  through april  all ten renewal groups whose current lease term expires on april  will be  upon renewal  in the second five year renewal period and  therefore  we have a unilateral bundle by bundle option to initiate a fair market rental reset process on any renewal group for which kindred delivers a renewal notice 
if we elect to initiate the fair market rental reset process for any renewal group  the renewal rent will be the higher of contract rent and fair market rent determined by an appraisal process set forth in the applicable kindred master lease 
in certain cases following our initiation of a fair market rental reset process with respect to a renewal group  kindred may have the right to revoke its renewal of that particular renewal group 
we cannot assure you that kindred will elect to renew any or all of the renewal groups for the assets or that we will be able to reposition any or all non renewed assets on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms  if at all 
in addition  the determination of market rent  whether on re leasing or under the reset process  is dependent on and may be influenced by a variety of factors and is highly speculative  and we cannot assure you as to what the market rent may be for any of the assets 
see risk factors risks arising from our business if we must replace any of our tenants or operators  we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms  or at all  and we could be subject to delays  limitations and expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on us included in item a of this annual report on form k 
the aggregate annual rent we receive under each kindred master lease is referred to as base rent 
base rent escalates on may of each year at a specified rate over the prior period base rent  with base rent escalation under the four original kindred master leases contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters 
the annual rent escalator under three kindred master leases is  and the annual rent escalator under the other two kindred master leases is based on year over year changes in cpi  subject to floors and caps 
assuming that all of the marketed assets are sold or transitioned on or prior to may  and assuming the applicable facility revenue parameters are met  and regardless of whether kindred provides renewal notices with respect to any or all of the assets  we currently expect that approximately million of aggregate base rent will be due under the five kindred master leases for the period from may  through april  see note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had a total of million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  operating cash and cash related to our senior living operations and mob operations reportable business segments that is deposited and held in property level accounts

we believe that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by cash flows from operations  cash on hand  debt assumptions and financings  issuances of debt and equity securities  proceeds from sales of real estate assets and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
however  if any of these sources of liquidity is unavailable to us or is not available at an acceptable cost or if we engage in significant acquisition or investment activity  we may seek or require additional capital through debt assumptions and financings including secured financings  dispositions of assets in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties and the issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities  or any combination thereof

dividends in order to continue to qualify as a reit  we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gain 
in  our board of directors declared and we paid cash dividends on our common stock aggregating per share  which exceeds of our estimated taxable income after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards 
we also intend to pay dividends greater than of our taxable income  after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards  for on february   our board of directors declared the first quarter dividend of per share  payable in cash on march  to holders of record on march  we expect that our reit taxable income will be less than our cash flows due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing reit taxable income 
although we expect to be able to satisfy the distribution requirement  from time to time  we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation

capital expenditures the terms of our triple net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple net leased properties 
from time to time  however  we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple net leased properties through loans to the tenants or advances  some of which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties 
after the terms of the triple net leases expire  or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases  we would expect to fund any capital expenditures for which we may become responsible with cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings 
with respect to our senior living operations and mob operations reportable business segments  we expect that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings 
to the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required  our liquidity may be affected adversely 
our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness
