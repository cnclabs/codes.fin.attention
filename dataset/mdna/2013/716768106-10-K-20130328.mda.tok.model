critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  asset impairments  reserve for closed stores  insurance liabilities and reserves  and income tax reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
distribution centers perform cycle counts using a velocity based system that determines whether the inventory should be counted every    or days 
stores generally perform physical inventories at least once a year 
between the physical inventories  stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their historical cost 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change  or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
we have not made any significant changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our inventory valuation reserves during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the accounting methodology and assumed factors used to create the estimates we use to calculate our inventory valuation reserves 

table of contents as of february   and january   we had inventory valuation reserves of million and million  respectively 
additionally  we do not believe that a change in our inventory valuation reserves would be material to our consolidated financial statements 
asset impairments we review long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we have not made any significant changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
no material asset impairments were identified during  or reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
as of february   and january   our reserve for closed stores was million and million  respectively 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine our reserve for closed stores  including cash flow projections and sublease assumptions 
we do not believe that a change in our reserve for closed stores would be material to our consolidated financial statements 
insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain workers compensation  general liability  product liability and property and casualty insurance 
we utilize high deductible plans for each of these areas as well as a self insured health plan for our eligible associates 
workers compensation deductibles generally carry a million per occurrence risk of claim liability 
our general liability plan specifies a million per occurrence risk of claim liability 
we establish reserves for claims under workers compensation and general liability plans based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss for all pending claims  including estimates for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
our loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment  favorable or adverse  to our reserves 
as of february   and january   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to workers compensation  general liability and self insured health plans 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our insurance reserves during the past three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our insurance reserves  including factors such as historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other valuations 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our insurance reserves would have affected net income by approximately million in income tax reserves we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at february   and january   were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given fiscal period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and could result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution

free cash flow free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec rules 
management believes that free cash flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating our financial performance and our ability to generate future cash from our business operations 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
although other companies report free cash flow  numerous methods exist for calculating free cash flow 
as a result  the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies 
we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of another company 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for property and equipment  and payments of capital lease obligations

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements substantially all our stores are leased facilities

credit facilities on march   we entered into a new million revolving credit facility agreement  or revolving credit facility  which replaced our former revolving credit facility agreement  or former revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires on march  borrowings under this revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base and bear interest  at our option  at libor plus or base rate plus 
the base rate is defined as the highest of the following rates the federal funds rate plus  the adjusted libor plus  or the prime rate

as of february   we were in compliance with the terms and covenants of our revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our financial assets 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profits during the fourth quarter due to increased holiday traffic 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store and petshotel openings and related preopening costs  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and petshotels and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate 
controllable expenses could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a year 
finally  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established 
while we have experienced inflationary pressure in recent years  we have been able to largely mitigate the effect by increasing retail prices accordingly 
although neither inflation nor deflation has had a material impact on net operating results  we can make no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
impact of federal health care reform legislation in march  the president of the united states signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of  or the acts 
uncertainty still exists regarding the magnitude of the impact of the acts on our consolidated financial statements 
the extent of the impact will not be known until we make final 
table of contents decisions regarding the options available to manage costs for benefit programs impacted by the acts 
we will continue to assess the impact of the acts on our health care plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
net sales in canada  denominated in united states dollars  were billion  or of our consolidated net sales for transaction gains and losses denominated in the united states dollar are recorded in cost of sales or operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income depending on the nature of the underlying transaction 
the transaction loss gain included in net income was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we maintain a natural hedge through management of the cash accounts denominated in united states dollars held in canada in an effort to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  we have also entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts  or foreign exchange contracts  in canada to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain balance sheet accounts 
we do not designate these foreign exchange contracts as hedges and  accordingly  they are recorded at fair value using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets 
the changes in the fair value are recognized in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the recorded gains and losses were immaterial for and we did not enter into foreign exchange contracts during
