item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources current resources 
our indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it requires us to utilize a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  development activity and other general corporate purposes  increases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions  limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or the industries in which we operate  makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates  as borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates  limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes  and places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness 

table of contents although our senior credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
also  these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness 
our senior credit facilities require us to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios and leverage ratios which become more restrictive over time 
while we have never defaulted on compliance with any financial covenants under the terms of our indebtedness  our ability to comply with these ratios in the future may be affected by events beyond our control  and an inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our senior credit facilities 
in the event of any default  the lenders under our senior credit facilities could elect to terminate lending commitments and declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
we may be unable to obtain debt or other financing on favorable terms or at all 
there are inherent risks in our ability to borrow 
our lenders may have suffered losses related to their lending and other financial relationships  especially because of the general weakening of the national economy  increased financial instability of many borrowers and the declining value of their assets 
as a result  lenders may become insolvent or tighten their lending standards  which could make it more difficult for us to borrow under our senior credit facilities  refinance our existing indebtedness or to obtain other financing on favorable terms or at all 
our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if we were unable to draw funds under our senior credit facilities because of a lender default or to obtain other cost effective financing 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures including the opening of new restaurants and reducing or eliminating other discretionary uses of cash 
we may be required to record additional asset impairment charges in the future 
we review long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangibles  subject to amortization  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of the asset value  an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances 
the other factors and circumstances include changes in the economic environment  changes in the manner in which assets are used  unfavorable changes in legal factors or business climate  incurring excess costs in construction of the asset  overall restaurant operating performance and projections for financial performance 
these estimates result in a wide range of variability on a year to year basis due to the nature of the criteria 
we evaluate future cash flow projections in conjunction with qualitative factors and future operating plans 
our impairment assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and operating outcomes  which are based upon a significant degree of management s judgment 
based on this analysis  if we believe that the carrying amount of the assets are not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized based upon the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds fair value 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies impairment of long lived assets 
as a result of the above mentioned review process  we incurred an asset impairment charge of approximately million in related to two restaurants and an asset impairment charge of approximately million in fiscal related to one restaurant 

table of contents continued economic weakness within our respective markets may adversely impact consumer discretionary spending and may result in lower restaurant sales 
unfavorable fluctuations in our commodity costs  supply costs and labor rates  which may or may not be within our control  may also impact our operating margins 
any of these factors could as a result affect the estimates used in our impairment analysis and require additional impairment tests and charges to earnings 
we continue to assess the performance of our restaurants and monitor the need for future impairment 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in additional charges to earnings 
security breaches of confidential guest information in connection with our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions may adversely affect our business 
the majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards 
other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers has been stolen 
we may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our guests credit or debit card information 
any such claim or proceeding  or any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations  may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which  in turn  could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks  service marks and other proprietary intellectual property  including our names and logos and the ambiance of our restaurants 
we have registered or applied to register a number of our trademarks 
we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved 
third parties may also oppose our trademark applications  or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks 
in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged  we could be forced to rebrand our goods and services  which could result in loss of brand recognition  and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands 
if our efforts to register  maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate  or if any third party misappropriates  dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property  the value of our brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance 
we may also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties intellectual property rights 
if third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights  our operating profits could be adversely affected 
any claims of intellectual property infringement  even those without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  require us to rebrand our services  if feasible  divert management s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party s intellectual property 
any royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages  enter into costly license or royalty agreements  or stop the sale of certain products or services  any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects 
information technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 
we rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations  including point of sale processing at our restaurants 
our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events  as well as from internal and external security breaches  viruses  worms and other disruptive problems 
any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities 
although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing 
table of contents and testing for weaknesses in our systems  controls  firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage  breaches or other disruptive problems  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful 
a major natural or man made disaster at our corporate facility could have a material adverse effect on our business 
most of our corporate systems  processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one ohio location with certain systems and processes being concurrently stored at an offsite storage facility in accordance with our disaster recovery plan 
back up data tapes are also sent to a separate off site location on a weekly basis 
as part of our disaster recovery plan  we backup data and environments from our core systems to our co location facility 
failures or delays in recovery of data  delayed reporting and compliance  inability to perform necessary corporate functions and other breakdowns in normal operating procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business and create exposure to administrative and other legal claims against us 
we incur increased cost obligations as a result of being a public company 
prior to october   as a privately held company  we were not required to comply with certain corporate governance and financial reporting practices and policies required of a publicly traded company 
new and changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder  as well as under the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended the sarbanes oxley act  and the rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the nasdaq global market  have created uncertainty for public companies and increased our costs and time that our board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations 
we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities 
furthermore  the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management s attention from implementing our growth strategy  which could prevent us from improving our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have made  and will continue to make  changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company 
however  the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
while we are in compliance with the sarbanes oxley act for fiscal  there is no guarantee that we will meet all areas of compliance in future years 
we will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with section furthermore  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely 
federal  state and local tax rules may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to federal  state and local taxes in the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  if the irs or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns  we could face additional tax liability  including interest and penalties 
if material  payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  complying with new tax rules  laws or regulations could impact our financial condition  and increases to federal or state statutory tax rates and other changes in tax laws  rules or regulations may increase our effective tax rate 
any increase in our effective tax rate could have a material impact on our 
table of contents financial results 
in  our federal tax return was audited by the irs 
while the audit is currently open  we do not believe that there will be any material findings  however  there is no guarantee that there will not be findings in this audit  future audits will not be conducted  or any findings recorded in a separate audit for another period 
risks relating to our common shares the price of our common shares may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment 
volatility in the market price of our common shares may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares 
the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly for various reasons  which include our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry  changes in laws or regulations  or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations  that are applicable to our business  the public s reaction to our press releases  our other public announcements and our filings with the sec  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  additions or departures of our senior management personnel  sales of common shares by our directors and executive officers  adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future  actions by shareholders  the level and quality of research analyst coverage for our common shares  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or failure to meet such estimates  the financial disclosure we may provide to the public  any changes in such disclosure or our failure to meet such disclosure  various market factors or perceived market factors  including rumors  whether or not correct  involving us  our distributors or suppliers or our competitors  introductions of new offerings or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  short sales  hedging and other derivative transactions in our common shares  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  and other events or factors  including changes in general conditions in the united states and global economies or financial markets including those resulting from acts of god  war  incidents of terrorism or responses to such events 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies  including companies in our industry 
the price of our common shares could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company  and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price 
in the past  following periods of market volatility in the price of a company s securities  security holders have often instituted class action litigation 
if the market value of our common shares experiences adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation  regardless of the outcome  we could incur substantial legal costs and our management s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business  causing our business to suffer 

table of contents future sales of our common shares in the public market could lower our share price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market by our existing shareholders  upon the exercise of outstanding stock options  vesting of shares of restricted stock or shares of stock granted in the future or by persons who acquire shares in the public market may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
such sales could also create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business 
these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had  common shares issued  and  treasury shares repurchased during in addition  we have reserved million common shares for issuance under the bravo brio restaurant group  inc stock incentive plan  of which  shares are subject to vesting under outstanding restricted stock awards and  shares remain eligible for future issuance 
stock options to purchase an aggregate of  common shares are currently vested and outstanding under the bravo development  inc option plan 
if securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares  publish negative research or reports  or do not publish reports about our business  our share price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us  our business and our industry 
if one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or our competitors stock  our share price would likely decline 
if one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline 
certain provisions of ohio law and our articles of incorporation and regulations may deter takeover attempts  which may limit the opportunity of our shareholders to sell their shares at a favorable price  and may make it more difficult for our shareholders to remove our board of directors and management 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and regulations may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include the following advance notice requirements for shareholders proposals and nominations  availability of blank check preferred shares  establishment of a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time  the right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or due to the resignation or departure of an existing board member  the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of shareholders to elect director candidates  and limitations on the removal of directors 
in addition  because we are incorporated in ohio  we are governed by the provisions of section of the ohio revised code 
these provisions may prohibit large shareholders  particularly those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our articles of incorporation and regulations and under ohio law could discourage potential takeover attempts  could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for our common shares in the future and could potentially result in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions 
although no preferred shares were outstanding as of december  and although we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares  our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to  preferred shares 
the preferred shares may be issued in one or more series  the terms of which will be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by the shareholders 
these 
table of contents terms may include voting rights  including the right to vote as a series on particular matters  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion rights  redemption rights and sinking fund provisions 
the issuance of any preferred shares could diminish the rights of holders of our common shares and  therefore  could reduce the value of our common shares 
in addition  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred shares could be used to restrict our ability to merge with  or sell assets to  a third party 
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred shares and the foregoing anti takeover provisions may prevent or frustrate attempts by a third party to acquire control of our company  even if some of our shareholders consider such change of control to be beneficial 
since we do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  investors may be forced to sell their shares in order to realize a return on their investment 
we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common shares 
we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common shares for the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  capital requirements  legal requirements  earnings and other factors 
our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of our senior credit facilities and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future 
consequently  you should not rely on dividends in order to receive a return on your investment 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us 
generally accepted accounting principles in the us are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
in addition  the sec has announced a multi year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by us issuers in their sec filings 
any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited 
our business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate 
in the future  we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities  debt or a combination of both 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our capital requirements 
if we issue new debt securities  the debt holders would have rights senior to common shareholders to make claims on our assets  and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations  including our ability to pay dividends on our common shares 
if we issue additional equity securities  existing shareholders will experience dilution  and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common shares 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  our shareholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interest

table of contents we utilize a or week accounting period which ends on the last sunday of the calendar year 
with the exception of which is a week year  each of the above fiscal years has weeks 
during the thirteen weeks ended june   the company determined that it was more likely than not that its existing net deferred tax assets and tax credits would be realized after considering all positive and negative evidence 
accordingly  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the reduction of the total federal and state valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets in the undeclared preferred dividend total for fiscal of million was offset by an add back of million in the fourth quarter of related to the exchange of the company s series a preferred stock 
the exchange of the series a preferred stock was completed prior to our initial public offering  using an estimated initial public offering price of per share which  based on the total liquidation preference for the series a preferred stock including accrued and undeclared dividends thereon of million as of the date of the exchange  resulted in the issuance of  common shares 
because the final initial public offering price was per share  the  common shares issued to the preferred shareholders represented only million of value  million less than the carrying value of the series a preferred stock as of the date of the exchange 
because the fair value of consideration transferred was less than the carrying amount of the series a preferred stock  the discount was added back to undeclared preferred dividends in arriving at net income loss attributed to common shareholders and is recorded as such on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal non gaap measures as adjusted net income and as adjusted earnings per share are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered by themselves or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we calculate these non gaap measures by adjusting net income and net income per share for the impact of certain items that are reflected to show a year over year comparison excluding certain non comparable items to facilitate the comparison of our past and present financial results 
we believe these adjusted measures provide additional information to facilitate the comparison of our past and present financial results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion also contains forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those factors set forth under part i  item a risk factors of this report 
overview we are an owner and operator of two distinct italian restaurant brands  bravo cucina italiana bravo and brio tuscan grille brio  which includes our one bon vie restaurant for purposes of the following discussion 
we have positioned our brands as multifaceted culinary destinations that deliver the ambiance  design elements and food quality reminiscent of fine dining restaurants at a value typically offered by casual dining establishments  a combination known as the upscale affordable dining segment 
each of our brands provides its guests with a fine dining experience and value by serving affordable cuisine prepared using fresh flavorful ingredients and authentic italian cooking methods  combined with attentive service in an attractive  lively atmosphere 
we strive to be the best italian restaurant company in america and are focused on providing our guests an excellent dining experience through consistency of execution 
our business is highly sensitive to changes in guest traffic 
increases and decreases in guest traffic can have a significant impact on our financial results 
in recent years  we have faced and we continue to face uncertain economic conditions  which have resulted in changes to our guests discretionary spending 
to adjust to this decrease in guest spending  we have focused on controlling product margins and costs while maintaining our high standards for food quality and service and enhancing our guests dining experience 
we have worked with our distributors and suppliers to control commodity costs  become more efficient with the use of our employee base and found new ways to improve efficiencies across our company 
we have increased our electronic advertising  social media communication and public relations activities in order to bring new guests to our restaurants and keep loyal guests coming back to grow our revenues 
additionally  we have focused resources on highlighting our menu items and promoting our non entr e selections such as appetizers  desserts and beverages as part of our efforts to drive higher sales volumes at our restaurants 
performance indicators we use the following key performance indicators in evaluating the performance of our restaurants comparable restaurants and comparable restaurant sales 
we consider a restaurant to be comparable in the first full quarter following the eighteenth month of operations 
changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time 
changes in comparable sales reflect changes in guest count trends as well as changes in average check 
average check 
average check is calculated by dividing revenues by guest counts for a given time period 
average check reflects menu price influences as well as changes in menu mix 
management uses this indicator to analyze trends in guests preferences  effectiveness of menu changes and price increases and per guest expenditures 
average unit volume 
average unit volume consists of the average sales of our restaurants over a certain period of time 
this measure is calculated by dividing total restaurant sales within a period by the relevant period 
this indicator assists management in measuring changes in guest traffic  pricing and development of our brands 
restaurant level operating margins 
restaurant level operating margin is revenues minus costs of sales  labor costs  operating expenses and occupancy costs 
management uses this measure to evaluate the restaurant performance at our properties and determine the flow through of additional revenues to net income 

table of contents operating margin 
operating margin represents income from operations before interest and taxes as a percentage of our revenues 
by monitoring and controlling our operating margins  we can gauge the overall profitability of our company 
key financial definitions revenues 
revenues primarily consist of food and beverage sales  net of any discounts  such as management meals  employee meals and coupons  associated with each sale 
revenues in a given period are directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period and comparable restaurant sales growth 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consist primarily of food and beverage related costs 
the components of cost of sales are variable in nature  change with sales volume and are subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs 
our cost of sales depends in part on the success of controls we have in place to manage our food and beverage costs 
labor costs 
labor costs include restaurant management salaries  front and back of house hourly wages  restaurant level manager bonus expense  employee benefits and payroll taxes 
operating costs 
operating costs consist primarily of restaurant related operating expenses  such as supplies  utilities  repairs and maintenance  credit card fees  marketing costs  training  recruiting  travel and general liability insurance costs 
occupancy costs 
occupancy costs include rent charges  both fixed and variable  as well as common area maintenance costs  property insurance and taxes  the amortization of tenant allowances and the adjustment to straight line rent 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs include costs associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our operations  including management and staff compensation and benefits  travel  legal and professional fees  corporate office rent  stock compensation costs and other related corporate costs 
restaurant pre opening costs 
restaurant pre opening costs consist of costs incurred prior to opening a restaurant  including executive chef and manager salaries  relocation costs  recruiting expenses  employee payroll and related training costs for new employees  including rehearsal of service activities 
pre opening costs also include an accrual for straight line rent recorded during the period between date of possession and the restaurant opening date for our leased restaurant locations 
impairment 
we review long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangibles  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of the asset value  an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances

table of contents impairment 
we review long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangibles  subject to amortization  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the use of assets  changes in our overall business strategy and significant negative industry or economic trends 
based upon our analysis  we incurred a non cash impairment charge in of million related to one restaurant 
the company did not incur an impairment charge in loss on extinguishment of debt 
in october  in connection with our initial public offering  we repaid all our then outstanding indebtedness under our former senior credit facilities and entered into new senior credit facilities 
in connection with this repayment of previously outstanding indebtedness  the company wrote off million in unamortized loan origination fees 
there were no such charges incurred in interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was due to the pay down of debt in conjunction with our initial public offering and the resulting lower average balances in fiscal as well as lower average interest rates during income taxes 
income taxes decreased million to an income tax benefit of million in  from income tax expense of million in during  it was deemed more likely than not that the company would realize the deferred tax assets due to its historical profitability trends 
as a result  the company eliminated the valuation allowance previously provided against net deferred tax assets 
the company recorded a million income tax benefit  for federal and state combined  reflecting the reduction of the full valuation allowance throughout for fiscal year  this tax benefit was offset by income tax expense of million 
liquidity our principal sources of cash have been net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our senior credit facilities 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of availability under our senior revolving credit facility after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit at december  
our need for capital resources is driven by our restaurant expansion plans  on going maintenance of our restaurants and investment in our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
based on our current real estate development plans  we believe our combined expected cash flows from operations  available borrowings under our senior credit facilities and expected landlord lease incentives will be sufficient to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities for the next twelve months 
consistent with many other restaurant and retail chain store operations  we use operating lease arrangements for the majority of our restaurant locations 
we believe that these operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage of our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
currently  operating lease obligations are not reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet 
the use of operating lease arrangements will impact our capacity to borrow money under our senior credit facilities 
however  restaurant real estate operating leases are expressly excluded from the restrictions under our senior credit facilities related to the incurrence of funded indebtedness 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including a decrease in guest traffic or average check per guest due to changes in economic conditions  as described in this report under part i  item a risk factors 

table of contents the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december   december  and december  year ended december  december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in our business is almost exclusively a cash business 
almost all of our receipts come in the form of cash and credit cards and a large majority of our expenditures are paid within a day period 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts in excess of cash expenditures from the prior year 
cash receipts in and were million and million  respectively 
cash expenditures during and were million and million  respectively 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash received from lease incentives in compared to cash received from lease incentives in of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in we used cash primarily to purchase property and equipment related to our restaurant expansion plans 
the increase in spending was related to the timing of restaurant openings  as well as the number of restaurants that were opened during versus during  we opened nine company owned restaurants and had two additional restaurants under construction at year end  while in we opened eight restaurants and five others were under construction at year end 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in in we repaid million in debt and repurchased million in treasury stock 
these were slightly offset by a million in net benefits from our equity plans 
in we paid down debt by million throughout the year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating activities

financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in in we repaid million in debt and had no additional borrowings while in  we paid down million in debt  primarily in connection with the repayment in full of our then outstanding loans under our former senior credit facilities and our then outstanding senior subordinated secured notes through the proceeds of our initial public offering and borrowings under our senior credit facilities 
as of december   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
capital resources future capital requirements 
our capital requirements are primarily dependent upon the pace of our real estate development program and resulting new restaurants 
our real estate development program is dependent upon many factors  including economic conditions  real estate markets  site locations and nature of lease agreements 
our capital expenditures also include costs for maintenance and capacity additions in our existing restaurants as well as information technology and other general corporate capital expenditures 
we anticipate that each new restaurant will  on average  require a total cash investment of million to million net of estimated lease incentives 
we expect to spend approximately to million per restaurant for cash pre opening costs 
the projected cash investment per restaurant is based on historical averages 
we currently estimate capital expenditures  net of lease incentives  for to be in the range of approximately to million  primarily related to the planned opening of seven to eight new restaurants in  early openings and normal maintenance related capital expenditures related to our existing restaurants 
in conjunction with these restaurant openings  we anticipate spending approximately million to million in pre opening costs in current resources 
our operations have not required significant working capital and  like many restaurant companies  we have been able to operate with negative working capital 
restaurant sales are primarily paid for in cash or by credit card  and restaurant operations do not require significant inventories or receivables 
in addition  we receive trade credit for the purchase of food  beverages and supplies  therefore reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at december   compared to a net working capital deficit of million at december  on october   we completed the initial public offering of our common shares 
we issued  shares in the offering  and existing shareholders sold an additional  previously outstanding shares  including  shares sold to cover over allotments 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million after the payment of offering expenses that were used  together with borrowings under our senior credit facilities as described below  to repay all of our then outstanding loans under our former senior credit facilities and to repay all of our then outstanding senior subordinated secured notes  in each case including any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with our initial public offering  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions with respect to our senior credit facilities 
our senior credit facilities provide for i a million term loan facility  maturing in  and ii a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to million including a sublimit cap of up to million for letters of credit and up to million for 
table of contents swing line loans  maturing in under the credit agreement  we are also entitled to incur additional incremental term loans and or increases in the revolving credit facility of up to million if no event of default exists and certain other requirements are satisfied 
our revolving credit facility is i jointly and severally guaranteed by each of our existing or subsequently acquired or formed subsidiaries  ii secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our subsidiaries tangible and intangible personal property  iii secured by a first priority security interest on all owned real property and iv secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
our senior credit facilities also require us to meet financial tests  including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated capital expenditures limitation 
at december   the company was in compliance with its applicable financial covenants 
additionally  our senior credit facilities contain negative covenants limiting  among other things  additional indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  additional liens  sales of assets  dividends  investments and advances  prepayments of debt  mergers and acquisitions  and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements and customary events of default  including payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  defaults under other material debt  events of bankruptcy and insolvency  failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the senior credit facilities to be in full force and effect  and a change of control of our business 
on october   the company entered into an amendment to its credit agreement 
the amendment eliminated dollar restrictions in paying dividends  distributions to shareholders  or repurchasing its common shares subject to the defined leverage ratio 
borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at our option of either i the alternate base rate as such term is defined in the credit agreement plus the applicable margin of to or ii at a fixed rate for a period of one  two  three or six months equal to libor plus the applicable margin of to 
the applicable margins with respect to our senior credit facilities vary from time to time in accordance with agreed upon pricing grids based on our consolidated total leverage ratio 
swing line loans under our senior credit facilities bear interest only at the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin 
interest on loans based upon the alternate base rate are payable on the last day of each calendar quarter in which such loan is outstanding 
interest on loans based on libor are payable on the last day of the applicable libor period and  in the case of any libor period greater than three months in duration  interest shall be payable quarterly 
in addition to paying any outstanding principal amount under our senior credit facilities  we are required to pay an unused facility fee to the lenders equal to to per annum on the aggregate amount of the unused revolving credit facility  excluding swing line loans  commencing on october   payable quarterly in arrears 
as of december   we had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million on our term loan facility and no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 
based on the company s forecasts  management believes that the company will be able to maintain compliance with its applicable financial covenants for the next twelve months 
management believes that cash flow from operations as well as available borrowings under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs over the same period 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our on going business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any vie transactions and did not otherwise have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents significant accounting policies pre opening costs 
restaurant pre opening costs consist primarily of wages and salaries  recruiting  meals  training  travel and lodging 
pre opening costs include an accrual for straight line rent recorded during the period between the date of possession and the restaurant opening date for the company s leased restaurant locations 
we expense all such costs as incurred 
these costs will vary depending on the number of restaurants under development in a reporting period 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost 
equipment consists primarily of restaurant equipment  furniture  fixtures and small wares 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term  including option periods  which are reasonably assured of renewal  or the estimated useful life of the asset 
the useful life of property and equipment involves judgment by management  which may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than if different assumptions were used 
property and equipment costs may fluctuate based on the number of new restaurants under development or opened  as well as any additional capital projects that are completed in a given period 
leases 
we currently lease all but four of our owned restaurant locations 
we evaluate each lease to determine its appropriate classification as an operating or capital lease for financial reporting purposes 
all of our leases are classified as operating leases 
we record the minimum lease payments for our operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term  including option periods which in the judgment of management are reasonably assured of renewal 
the lease term commences on the date that the lessee obtains control of the property  which is normally when the property is ready for tenant improvements 
contingent rent expense is recognized as incurred and is usually based on either a percentage of restaurant sales or a percentage of restaurant sales in excess of a defined amount 
our lease costs will change based on the lease terms of our lease renewals as well as leases that we enter into with respect to our new restaurants 
leasehold improvements financed by the landlord through tenant improvement allowances are capitalized as leasehold improvements with the tenant improvement allowances recorded as deferred lease incentives 
deferred lease incentives are amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the life of the asset or the lease term  including option periods which in the judgment of management are reasonably assured of renewal same term that is used for related leasehold improvements and are recorded as a reduction of occupancy expense 
as part of the initial lease terms  we negotiate with our landlords to secure these tenant improvement allowances 
there is no guarantee that we will receive tenant improvement allowances for any of our future locations  which would result in additional occupancy expenses 
impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets 
we review long lived assets  such as property  equipment and intangibles  subject to amortization  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of the asset value  an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances 
the other factors and circumstances include changes in the economic environment  changes in the manner in which assets are used  unfavorable changes in legal factors or business climate  incurring excess costs in construction of the asset  overall restaurant operating performance and projections for future performance 
these estimates result in a wide range of variability on a year to year basis due to the nature of the criteria 
we evaluate future undiscounted cash flow projections in conjunction with qualitative factors and future operating plans 
our impairment assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and operating outcomes  which are based upon a significant degree of management s judgment 
based on this analysis  if we believe that the carrying amount of the assets are not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized based upon the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds fair value 
in performing our impairment testing  we forecast our future undiscounted cash flows by considering recent 
table of contents restaurant level performance  restaurant level operating plans  sales trends  and cost trends for cost of sales  labor and operating expenses 
we believe that this combination of information gives us a fair benchmark to predict future undiscounted cash flows 
we compare this cash flow forecast to the assets carrying value at the restaurant 
if the predicted future undiscounted cash flow does not exceed the assets carrying value  we impair the assets related to that restaurant as indicated above 
in  as a result of the above mentioned review process  we incurred an asset impairment charge of approximately million related to two restaurants 
continued economic weakness within our respective markets may adversely impact consumer discretionary spending and may result in lower restaurant sales 
unfavorable fluctuations in our commodity costs  supply costs and labor rates  which may or may not be within our control  may also impact our operating margins 
any of these factors could as a result affect the estimates used in our impairment analysis and require additional impairment tests and charges to earnings 
we continue to assess the performance of our restaurants and monitor the need for future impairment 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in additional charges to earnings 
self insurance reserves 
we maintain various insurance policies  including workers compensation and general liability 
as outlined in these policies  we are responsible for losses up to certain limits 
we record a liability for the estimated exposure for aggregate losses 
this liability is based on estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions  including actuarial assumptions  historical trends and economic conditions 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates and historical trends  our financial results could be impacted 
income taxes 
income tax provisions consist of federal and state taxes currently due  plus deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely than not of realization in future periods 
future taxable income  adjustments in temporary differences  available carry forward periods and changes in tax laws could affect these estimates 
we recognize a tax position in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information 
commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  on an actual basis 
payments due by year contractual obligations total after in thousands term loan facility interest operating leases construction purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations our million term loan facility will be paid off over the next three years with the outstanding balance due in 
table of contents inflation our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant guests 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant operations 
many of our restaurant staff members are paid hourly rates in accordance with the federal and state minimum wage rates 
since  numerous state and local governments increased the minimum wage within their jurisdictions  with further state minimum wage increases going into effect each year 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and we may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of revenues 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
segment reporting we operate upscale affordable dining restaurants under two brands that have similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  class of customer and distribution methods 
therefore  we report our results of operations as one reporting segment 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements we reviewed all newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they either are not applicable to our operations or that no material effect is expected on our financial statements as a result of future adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our long term indebtedness 
our principal interest rate exposure relates to the loans outstanding under our senior credit facilities  which are payable at variable rates 
we currently have approximately million of borrowings under our term loan facility 
each eighth point change in interest rates on the variable rate portion of indebtedness under our senior credit facilities would result in annual changes of approximately  in our interest expense 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market price fluctuation in beef  seafood  produce and other food product prices 
given the historical volatility of beef  seafood  produce and other food product prices  these fluctuations can materially impact our food and beverage costs 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of 
table of contents our control 
we are unable to contract for some of our commodities such as certain produce items for periods longer than one week 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
because we typically set our menu prices in advance of our food product prices  we cannot immediately take into account changing costs of food items 
to the extent that we are unable to pass the increased costs on to our guests through price increases  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge our risk to market price fluctuations in beef  seafood  produce and other food product prices at this time
