recently issued accounting pronouncements 
this section provides a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to six flags  including a discussion of the impact or potential impact of such standards on our financial statements when applicable 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
please see the discussion regarding forward looking statements included under the caption cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors for a discussion of some of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
the following discussion and analysis presents information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis reflect the effects of our reclassification of the assets  liabilities and results of parks previously divested  including our louisville and new orleans parks  as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the impact of the chapter filing in june and our emergence on april  overview we are the largest regional theme park operator in the world based on the number of parks we operate 
of our regional theme and water parks  are located in the united states  one is located in mexico city  mexico and one is located in montreal  canada 
our parks are located in 
table of contents geographically diverse markets across north america and they generally offer a broad selection of state of the art and traditional thrill rides  water attractions  themed areas  concerts and shows  restaurants  game venues and retail outlets  thereby providing a complete family oriented entertainment experience 
we work continuously to improve our parks and our guests experiences and to meet our guests evolving needs and preferences 
our revenue is primarily derived from i the sale of tickets for entrance to our parks approximately of revenue in  ii the sale of food and beverages  merchandise  games and attractions  parking and other services inside our parks  and iii sponsorship  licensing and other fees 
revenues from ticket sales and in park sales are primarily impacted by park attendance 
revenues from sponsorship  licensing and other fees can be impacted by the term  timing and extent of services and fees under these arrangements  which can result in fluctuations from year to year 
during  our park earnings before interest  tax expense  depreciation and amortization park ebitda improved as a result of increased revenues 
the increase in revenue was driven by a increase in attendance during our cash operating costs increased primarily as a result of labor and fringe benefit costs associated with the increased volume demands and incentive compensation 
our principal costs of operations include salaries and wages  employee benefits  advertising  outside services  maintenance  utilities and insurance 
a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because our costs for full time employees  maintenance  utilities  advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for the chapter filing we follow the accounting prescribed by fasb asc  which provides guidance for periods subsequent to a chapter filing regarding the presentation of liabilities that are and are not subject to compromise by the bankruptcy court proceedings  as well as the treatment of interest expense and presentation of costs associated with the proceedings 
in accordance with fasb asc  debt discounts or premiums as well as debt issuance costs should be viewed as valuations of the related debt 
when the debt has become an allowed claim and the allowed claim differs from the carrying amount of the debt  the recorded carrying amount should be adjusted to the allowed claim 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off costs that were associated with unsecured debt that was included in liabilities subject to compromise at april  premiums and discounts as well as debt issuance cost on debt that was not subject to compromise  such as fully secured claims  were not adjusted 
because the former stockholders of sfi owned less than of the voting shares after sfi emerged from bankruptcy  we adopted fresh start accounting effective may  whereby our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair value using the principles of purchase accounting contained in fasb asc topic the difference between our estimated fair value and our identifiable assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of application of fresh start accounting and effects of the plan 
the 
table of contents implementation of the plan and the application of fresh start accounting as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements results in financial statements that are not comparable to financial statements in periods prior to emergence 
property and equipment with the adoption of fresh start accounting on april   property and equipment was revalued based on the new replacement cost less depreciation valuation methodology 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in determining the fair value of property and equipment under fresh start accounting 
property and equipment additions are recorded at cost and the carrying value is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases in which we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the remaining net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense evenly through the remaining expected life 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets totaled  million at december   consisting of property and equipment  million  goodwill million and other intangible assets million 
with our adoption of fresh start accounting upon emergence  assets were initially revalued based on the fair values of long lived assets 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in determining fair value of long lived assets under fresh start accounting 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators are identified that an asset may be impaired 
we identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
we are a single reporting unit 
for each year  the fair value of the single reporting unit exceeded our carrying amount based on a comparison of the market price of our common stock to the carrying amount of our stockholders equity deficit 
accordingly  no impairment was required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit were to be less than the carrying amount  we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets 
if such assets are not considered to be fully recoverable  any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from 
table of contents differing treatment of items  such as depreciation periods for our property and equipment and recognition of our deferred revenue  for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss carryforwards will be recovered by way of offset against taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must reflect such amount as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million  million and million at december   december  and december   respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance at december  is primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards that cannot be used because we no longer have operations in the states where they were generated 
the valuation allowance at december  and december  was based on our estimates of taxable income solely from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets reverse 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
variables that will impact whether our deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration include  among other things  attendance  per capita spending and other revenues  capital expenditures  levels of debt  interest rates  operating expenses  sales of assets  and changes in state or federal tax laws 
in determining the valuation allowance we do not consider  and under generally accepted accounting principles cannot consider  the possible changes in state or federal tax laws until the laws change 
to the extent we reduce capital expenditures  our future accelerated tax deductions for our rides and equipment will be reduced  and our interest expense deductions would decrease as the debt balances are reduced by cash flow that previously would have been utilized for capital expenditures 
increases in capital expenditures without corresponding increases in net revenues would reduce short term taxable income and increase the likelihood of additional valuation allowances being required as net operating loss carryforwards expire prior to their utilization 
conversely  increases in revenues in excess of operating expenses would reduce the likelihood of additional valuation allowances being required as the short term taxable income would increase net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
see note s to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to our emergence from chapter proceedings  our profitability has increased which has allowed us to begin to project future taxable income after and assess our valuation allowance as well 
recent events on december   holdings issued million of senior unsecured notes due january  the notes 
also  on december   we entered into an amendment to the credit facility the credit facility amendment that among other things  permitted us to i issue the notes  ii use million of the proceeds of the notes issuance to repay the million that was outstanding under the term loan a and million of the outstanding balance of the term loan b  iii use the remaining million of proceeds from the notes issuance for share repurchases and other corporate matters  and iv reduce the interest rate payable on the term loan b by basis points 
in connection with the credit facility amendment  the issuance of the notes and the repayment of the term loan a and a portion of the term loan b  we recorded a million loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december  
table of contents on december   we entered into a new  million credit agreement the credit facility  which replaced the first lien amendment and related facilities 
the credit facility was comprised of a million revolving credit loan facility the revolving loan  a million tranche a term loan facility the term loan a and an million tranche b term loan facility the term loan b and together with the term loan a  the term loans prior to being amended on december  in certain circumstances  the term loan b can be increased by million 
in connection with the credit facility  we terminated the senior credit facility  repaid in full the million senior term loan  and recorded a million loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
one of our fundamental business goals is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term 
as part of our strategy to achieve this goal  we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends in the fourth quarter of and each quarter during and in february  holdings board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from per share of common stock to per share 
in october  holdings board of directors further increased the quarterly cash dividend from per share of common stock to per share

year ended december  revenue 
revenue in totaled  million compared to  million in  representing a increase 
the increase in revenues is attributable to a million increase in attendance  partially offset by an decrease in total revenue per capita primarily related to a significantly higher mix of season pass attendance  the negative exchange rate impact on revenue at our parks located in mexico city and montreal and decreased sponsorship revenues 
the increase in attendance was driven by our strategy to increase season pass sales and the successful marketing of our new rides and attractions 
per capita guest spending increased to in from in the prior year 
in the first quarter of  we received business interruption insurance proceeds from a claim relating to hurricane irene totaling million 
excluding the insurance proceeds benefit and the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impacts  total guest spending per capita increased admissions revenue per capita was up in compared to the prior year  and reflects primarily a increase in attendance primarily due to season pass visitation  which lowers per capita spending but increases overall admissions revenue  that was partially offset by i increased prices and reduced discounts and ii the ticket related portion of the hurricane irene insurance proceeds in the 
table of contents prior year period 
the increase in attendance drove increased revenues from food and beverage  rentals  retail  parking and other guest services  but the increased mix of season pass attendance and the negative foreign currency exchange rate impact related to our parks in mexico city and montreal resulted in a decrease in non admissions per capita guest spending in  including the non admission portion of the insurance proceeds 
the non admissions per capita spending was negatively impacted by of foreign currency exchange fluctuation at our parks in mexico city and montreal 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased million compared to operating expenses in this increase was primarily driven by increases in i salaries  wages and benefits million  and ii an increase in operating tax expense primarily related to a refund that was received in million  offset by a favorable exchange rate impact at our parks in mexico city and montreal million 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to the increase primarily reflects an increase in salaries  wages and benefits million primarily related to an million increase in stock based compensation  partially offset by i reduced insurance costs million  ii the favorable settlement of an old property claim million  iii a decrease in advertising expense million and iv a favorable exchange rate impact at our parks in mexico city and montreal million 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in increased million compared to  primarily due to increased revenues in food and beverage and retail partially offset by a favorable exchange rate impact at our parks in mexico city and montreal 
as a percentage of our in park guest spending excluding the six flags great escape lodge and indoor waterpark  cost of products sold decreased in compared to depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million compared to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to assets that were fully depreciated and amortized in as compared to loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets increased by million in compared to primarily related to the loss associated with the transfer to an unrelated third party of our killer whale formerly located at six flags discovery kingdom  partially offset by a gain recognized from insurance proceeds received in the first quarter of for certain assets at our east coast parks damaged by hurricane irene during the third quarter of gain on sale of investee 
gain on sale of investee for of million was related to the sale of our interest in dcp 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  for decreased million compared to  primarily reflecting reduced interest rates resulting from the december debt refinancing transaction  partially offset by increased interest expense resulting from the notes issuance that closed in december equity in loss income of investee 
the million decrease in equity in loss of investee in compared to is attributable to selling our interest in dcp in september loss on debt extinguishment 
the million loss on debt extinguishment in was recognized on the repayment in full and termination of the million term loan a and the partial repayment of million of the term loan b during the credit facility amendment 

table of contents the million loss on debt extinguishment in was primarily the result of the repayment in full and termination of the million senior term loan and the termination of the tw loan in december in conjunction with the credit facility 
restructure recovery costs 
during we recovered the remaining restructure costs that were accrued in during  restructure costs incurred were attributable to a million settlement reached with our former executive vice president and chief financial officer during may during the year ended december   we recorded million of restructuring charges for the aforementioned settlement and related costs after consideration of amounts previously accrued 
reorganization items  net 
during and  we incurred million and million  respectively  of reorganization items for costs and expenses directly related to the reorganization including fees associated with advisors to the debtors  certain creditors and the creditors committee as such term is defined in the plan 
as of december  all of our cases have been closed and there should be minimal reorganization costs  if any  in future periods 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million in and million for the benefit was the result of the release of our valuation allowance that we had on certain of our deferred tax assets 
we released the valuation allowance because of our taxable income generated and our future taxable income projections showed full utilization of our federal net operating loss nol carryforwards and partial utilization of our state nol carryforwards before they expired 
as a result  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will utilize our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration 
the benefit in was primarily related to reflecting the utilization of nol carryforwards during at december   we estimate we had approximately billion of nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes and billion of nol carryforwards for state income tax purposes 
see note s and note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  vs

revenue in increased million to  million compared to million in reflecting increased per capita guest spending 
per capita guest spending  which excludes sponsorship  licensing  accommodations at the six flags great escape lodge and other fees  increased to in compared to in admissions revenue per capita increased to in compared to in  and was driven primarily by improved yield on single day tickets and season pass pricing coupled with a favorable exchange rate impact on admissions revenue per capita at our parks in mexico city and montreal of 
increased revenues from rentals  food and beverage  retail  paid attractions and catering during resulted in a increase in non admissions per capita guest spending compared to the prior year period  of which approximately was attributable to the stronger mexican peso and canadian dollar 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for decreased million compared to operating expenses in this decrease was primarily driven by decreases in i salaries  wages and benefits million  ii utilities million  iii contract shows million  and iv royalty expense million 
these decreases were primarily related to our ongoing cost reduction program  our planned reduction in low margin operating days and a reduction in operating days due to adverse weather and were partially offset by an unfavorable exchange rate impact at our parks in mexico city and montreal million 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to the increase primarily reflects an increase in non cash stock based compensation million partially offset by i a decrease in advertising expense million and ii a decrease in consulting services million 

table of contents costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in decreased million compared to  primarily due to our strategic decision to replace external vendors with in house operations  which led to an improvement in gross margins

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the impact of the disposition of theme parks on our financial position and results of operations 
liquidity  capital commitments and resources general our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand 
our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations  debt service  investments in parks including capital projects  common stock dividends  payments to our partners in the partnership parks  and common stock repurchases 
sfi did not pay a dividend on sfi common stock during the four months ended april  during the years ended december   and  holdings paid million  million and million  respectively  in cash dividends on its common stock 
in february  holdings board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from per share of common stock to per share 
in october  holdings board of directors further increased the quarterly cash dividend from per share of common stock to per share 
the amount and timing of any future dividends payable on holdings common stock are within the sole discretion of holdings board of directors 
based on i our current number of shares outstanding and ii estimates of share repurchases  restricted stock vesting and option exercises  we currently anticipate paying approximately million in cash dividends on our common stock for the calendar year 
in february  we initiated a stock repurchase program the first stock repurchase plan  which permitted holdings to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock over a three year period 
under the first stock repurchase plan  during the twelve months ended december   holdings repurchased an aggregate of  shares at a cumulative price of approximately million 
the small amount of remaining shares that were permitted to be repurchased under the first stock repurchase plan were repurchased in january on january   holdings board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permitted holdings to repurchase up to million in shares of holdings common stock over a four year period the second stock repurchase plan 
during the twelve months ended december   holding repurchased an aggregate of  shares at a cumulative price of approximately million under the second stock repurchase plan 
as of january   holdings had repurchased an additional  shares at a cumulative price of approximately million and an average price per share of to complete the permitted repurchases under the second stock repurchase plan 
on december   holdings board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permits holdings to repurchase up to an additional million in shares of holdings common stock over a three year period the third stock repurchase plan 
as of february   holdings has repurchased  shares at a cumulative price of approximately million and an average price per share of under the third stock repurchase plan 
we believe that  based on historical and anticipated operating results  cash flows from operations  available cash and available amounts under the credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  common 
table of contents stock dividends  scheduled debt requirements  obligations under arrangements relating to the partnership parks and discretionary common stock repurchases 
our current and future liquidity is greatly dependent upon our operating results  which are driven largely by overall economic conditions as well as the price and perceived quality of the entertainment experience at our parks 
our liquidity could also be adversely affected by a disruption in the availability of credit as well as unfavorable weather  contagious diseases  such as swine or avian flu  accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition at our parks  including terrorist acts or threats  negative publicity or significant local competitive events  that could significantly reduce paid attendance and  therefore  revenue at any of our parks 
while we work with local police authorities on security related precautions to prevent certain types of disturbances  we can make no assurance that these precautions will be able to prevent these types of occurrences 
however  we believe that our ownership of many parks in different geographic locations reduces the effects of adverse weather or these other types of occurrences on our consolidated results 
if such an adverse event were to occur  we may be unable to borrow under the revolving loan or be required to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility and or may need to seek additional financing 
in addition  we expect that we may be required to refinance all or a significant portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity and potentially seek additional financing 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain any additional financing 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors contained in this annual report on form k 
as of december   our total indebtedness  net of discount  was approximately  million 
based on i non revolving credit debt outstanding on that date  ii anticipated levels of working capital revolving borrowings during  iii estimated interest rates for floating rate debt  and iv the notes  we anticipate annual cash interest payments will aggregate million for and approximately million in the lower amount for is primarily due to the timing of interest payments on the notes in the first year after they were issued 
under the credit facility  approximately of the term loan b is not due until december as of december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash and million available for borrowing under the revolving loan 
our ability to borrow under the revolving loan is dependent upon compliance with certain conditions  including a maximum senior leverage maintenance covenant and a minimum interest coverage covenant and the absence of any material adverse change in our business or financial condition 
if we were to become unable to borrow under the revolving loan  and we failed to meet our projected results from operations significantly  we might be unable to pay in full our off season obligations 
a default under the revolving loan could permit the lenders under the credit facility to accelerate the obligations thereunder 
the revolving loan expires on december  the terms and availability of the credit facility and other indebtedness are not affected by changes in the ratings issued by rating agencies in respect of our indebtedness 
for a more detailed description of our indebtedness  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently plan on spending approximately of revenues on capital expenditures for the calendar year 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities before reorganization items was million 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures  partially offset by million of proceeds we received from the sale of dcp 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily attributable to the proceeds received from the issuance of the notes and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to stock option exercises  partially offset by the repurchase of stock  the payment of cash dividends  distributions to our noncontrolling interests  the payment of deferred financing costs and the repayment of borrowings during the credit facility amendment 

table of contents since our business is both seasonal in nature and involves significant levels of cash transactions  our net operating cash flows are largely driven by attendance and per capita spending levels because much of our cash based expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with either attendance or per capita spending 
these cash based operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits  advertising  third party services  repairs and maintenance  utilities and insurance 
long term debt our total debt at december  was  million  which included approximately million of the notes  million under the credit facility and million under the hwp refinance loan

our insurance 
table of contents premiums and self insurance retention levels have remained relatively constant during the three year period ending december  we cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage  the level of any self insurance retention applicable thereto  the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks 
we are party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
see legal proceedings for information on certain significant litigation 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on the prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
market risks and sensitivity analyses like other companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operations  cash flows and equity 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
in march  we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate agreement with a notional amount of million in order to limit exposure to an increase in the libor interest rate of the term loan b see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our term loan b borrowings bear interest on libor plus an applicable margin 
the interest rate agreement capped the libor component of the interest rate at 
the term of the agreement began in march and expires in march upon executing the agreement  we designated and documented the interest rate agreement as a cash flow hedge 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted million of the term loan component under our prepetition credit agreement into a fixed rate obligation 
the terms of the agreements  each of which had a notional amount of million  began in february and were scheduled to expire in february our prepetition term loan borrowings bore interest based upon libor plus a fixed margin 
under our interest rate swap arrangements  our interest rates ranged from to with an average of 
as a result of the chapter filing  the interest rate swap agreements were terminated by our counterparties and we recorded a million loss in other expense in on the effective date  we settled all obligations under the interest rate swaps 
as a result of fresh start accounting  the remaining accumulated other comprehensive income balance was eliminated and recorded as part of the reorganization items 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our interest rate swaps 
the following analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value  operations and cash flows of our market risk financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates as if these changes occurred at december  the range of potential change in the market chosen for this analysis reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of these changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had total debt of  million  of which  million represents fixed rate debt  after giving effect to the floating to fixed interest rate agreement that we put in place in march see note to the consolidated financial statements  and the balance represents floating rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not 
table of contents impact book value  operations or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future operations and cash flows  assuming other factors remain constant 
assuming other variables remain constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  the pre tax operating and cash flow impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately million

recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this update permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
the previous guidance required an entity to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
the amendment gives an entity the option not to calculate annually the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
these amendments  which permit an entity to assess qualitative factors when testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  result in guidance that is similar to the goodwill impairment testing guidance 
the new guidance is effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after september  we adopted the new guidance at september  as a result  we assessed qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that our indefinite lived trade name intangible asset was impaired at december  based on our qualitative assessment  we determined that our trade name intangible asset was not impaired at december  and therefore we did not perform a quantitative analysis 
see note o to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for variable interest entities 
this update changes the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity 
it also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
previously  the applicable guidance required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity only when specific events had occurred 
qualifying special purpose entities  which were previously exempt from the application of this standard  will be subject to the provisions of this standard when it becomes effective 
this update also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise involvement with a variable interest entity 
the new guidance is effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after november  we adopted the new guidance at january  as a result of adopting this update  we consolidated hwp development  llc joint venture as of january   which resulted in a million and a million increase in our assets and liabilities  respectively 
the equity interests owned by non affiliated parties in hwp are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as noncontrolling interest 
the portion of earnings attributable to the non affiliated parties is reflected as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated statements of 
table of contents operations for periods ended december   december  and april  the adoption of this updated amendment did not change the accounting treatment of the partnerships that own sfot and sfog  which we continued to consolidate
