table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview hastings is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that buys  sells  trades and rents various home entertainment products  including books  music  software  periodicals  new and used cds  movies on dvd and blu ray  video games  video game consoles and electronics 
we also offer consumables and trends products such as apparel  t shirts  action figures  posters  greeting cards and seasonal merchandise through our entertainment stores and our internet web site 
as of march   we operated stores averaging approximately  square feet in medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the stores  operated on leased premises  is wholly owned by us and is operated under the name of hastings 
we also operate three concept stores  sun adventure sports  located in amarillo  texas and lubbock  texas  and tradesmart  located in littleton  colorado  which are wholly owned by us 
over the past three years  our financial performance has been adversely impacted by a number of factors  including the economic downturn and the expanding digital delivery of entertainment 
as the economy improves  we expect our total revenues to improve 
however  as consumer spending patterns shift toward digital delivery of content and internet retailers  particularly with regard to books  we expect the negative trends in sales of new books to continue and therefore expect a slight single digit decrease in book comp sales  excluding sales of nextbook tablet electronic book readers and related accessories  for fiscal we expect music comp sales  which have had mid single to double digit decreases for the last five years driven primarily by digital content delivery  to have a slight decrease for fiscal movie comps have been negatively impacted by a weak schedule of new releases during fiscal which has directly impacted new movie sales 
we expect the negative trend in sales of new movies to continue but we expect a slight increase for total movie comps for fiscal  primarily driven by an increase in sales of used movies 
our operating strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by remodeling existing stores and offering our products through our internet web site 
we are also focused on shifting our business model more toward lifestyle and consumer electronics products to become less dependent on entertainment products 
some examples of such products include tablet expansions for reading  watching movies  hobby  crafts and playing games and phone app products to be used with your smart phone for fun  health and fitness 
references in this annual report on form k to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates comprise our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly or quarterly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
inventory costing requires certain significant estimates and judgments involving the allocation of costs and vendor allowances 
these practices affect ending inventories at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins and inventory turnover ratios 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can also affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record the lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated market value and returnability of merchandise inventory by product category and record an adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 

table of contents rental asset depreciation 
we have established rental asset depreciation policies that match rental product costs with the related revenues 
these policies require that we make significant estimates  based upon our experience  as to the ultimate amount and timing of revenue to be generated from our rental product 
we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation because it approximates the pattern of demand for the product  which is higher when the product is initially released by the studios for rental and declines over time 
in establishing salvage values for our rental product  we consider the sales prices and sales volume of our previously rented product and other used product 
we currently depreciate the cost of our rental assets on an accelerated basis over six months or nine months  except for rental assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over months 
rental assets  which include dvds  blu rays and video games  are depreciated to salvage values ranging from to rental assets purchased for less than established salvage values are not depreciated 
we also review the carrying value of our rental assets to ensure that estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying value 
we periodically record adjustments to the value of previously rented product primarily for estimated obsolescence or excess product based upon changes in our original assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than our original estimates  additional adjustments  including adjustments to useful lives or salvage values  may be required 
we continually evaluate the estimates surrounding the useful lives and salvage values used in depreciating our rental assets 
changes to these estimates resulting from changes in consumer demand  changes in customer preferences or the price or availability of retail products may materially impact the carrying value of our rental assets and our rental margins 
the costs of rental product purchased pursuant to revenue sharing arrangements  which are recorded in rental cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations  typically include a lower initial product cost than traditional rental purchases with a certain percentage of the net rental revenues shared with studios over an agreed period of time 
any up front costs exceeding the designated salvage value are amortized on an accelerated basis and revenue sharing payments pursuant to the applicable arrangement are expensed as rental cost of sales as the related revenue is earned 
additionally  certain titles have performance guarantees 
we analyze titles that are subject to performance guarantees and recognize an estimated expense for under performing titles throughout the applicable period based upon our analysis of the estimated rental revenue shortfall 
we revise these estimates on a monthly basis  based on actual results 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate under performing stores on a quarterly basis to determine whether projected future cash flows over the remaining lease term are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the fixed asset investment in each individual store 
if projected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the fixed asset investment  an impairment charge is recognized if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of leasehold improvements as well as certain other property and equipment is subject to impairment write down 
income taxes 
in determining net income loss  we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for future income tax consequences that are attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their income tax bases 
we base the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on enacted tax rates that we expect will apply to taxable earnings in the year when we expect to settle or recover those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities on any change in income tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our ability to carry back operating losses to prior periods  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
we reassess the valuation allowance quarterly  and  if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance  a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood  on a cumulative basis  of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 

table of contents share based compensation 
determining the amount of share based compensation to be recorded in the statement of operations requires us to develop estimates that are used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility is derived based upon our historical stock prices over the expected life of the option 
expected life of the option the estimate of an expected life is calculated based on historical data relating to grants  exercises and cancellations  as well as the vesting period and contractual life of the option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option 
our stock price volatility and expected option lives involve management s best estimates at the grant date  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes pricing model and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the vesting period of the option 
we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of options that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
in addition to stock options  we award restricted stock awards  including restricted stock units and performance based restricted stock awards 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the average of the opening and closing stock price on the day on which they are granted 
for performance based restricted stock awards  compensation expense is recognized if management deems it probable that the performance conditions will be met 
management must use its judgment to determine the probability that a performance condition will be met 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  future results could be materially impacted 
gift card breakage revenue 
we sell gift cards through each of our stores and through our web site www 
gohastings 
com 
the gift cards we sell have no stated expiration dates or fees and are subject to potential escheatment rights in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
gift card liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of sale of such cards with the costs of designing  printing and distributing the cards recorded as expense as incurred 
gift card breakage revenue is recognized as gift cards are redeemed  based upon an analysis of the aging and utilization of gift cards  our determination that the likelihood of future redemption is remote and our determination that such balances are not subject to escheatment laws applicable to our operations

a valuation allowance is required if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including our ability to carry back operating losses to prior periods  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
based on this analysis  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as such  we established a valuation allowance of approximately million at january  excluding the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate for fiscal was  as compared to an effective rate of for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations from the sale of merchandise and the rental of products  most of which is received in cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities  including trade credit from vendors  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  with the most significant source in fiscal being cash flow from operating activities and fiscal being borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchasing  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental products  opening new stores and expanding or reformatting existing stores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments  except for the stock buyback programs more fully discussed below 
we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  store reformations and other capital commitments  including the possibility of an annual dividend  through fiscal at january   total outstanding debt was million 
we project our outstanding debt level at january  will be in the range of to million 
at january   we had approximately million in excess availability under the facility as defined below  after the million availability reserve 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared to a net loss of million for fiscal purchases of rental assets decreased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal in anticipation of lower rental revenues 
consequently  rental asset depreciation expense decreased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal change in deferred income tax was million less during fiscal compared to as a result of recognizing a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in merchandise inventories decreased approximately million during fiscal  compared to a decrease of million during fiscal  primarily due to lower anticipated merchandise revenues and operating fewer stores 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased million during fiscal compared to an increase of million during fiscal 
table of contents  primarily due to the receipt of a federal income tax receivable during fiscal and a large increase in prepaid expenses during fiscal trade accounts payable increased approximately million during fiscal compared to a decrease of million during fiscal  primarily due to timing in payments to vendors 
other net assets and liabilities decreased million during fiscal compared to an increase of million during fiscal  primarily due to the abandoned lease accrual that was recognized during fiscal during fiscal  we estimate net cash provided by operations of approximately to million 
the expected decrease from fiscal net cash provided by operations to estimated fiscal net cash provided by operations results primarily from a relatively flat inventory balance  as well as the fact that we received a million payment on an income tax receivable during fiscal investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased expenditures related to new stores and remodels 
in fiscal  the company projects capital expenditures to be approximately to million  as we continue to manage discretionary spending during fiscal financing activities 
cash provided by or used in financing activities is primarily associated with borrowings and payments made under our revolving credit facility described below under capital structure 
for fiscal  cash used in financing activities was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal net repayments to our revolving credit facility during fiscal were approximately million compared to net borrowings of approximately million during fiscal the company purchased million of treasury stock in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal we plan to purchase up to million of treasury stock during fiscal  which will be dependent upon movement of our stock price and actual fiscal operating results 
changes in our cash overdraft position increased from cash used of million for fiscal to cash provided of million for fiscal  due to timing of payments issued to vendors at the end of each year 
in addition  we paid a special dividend of per share and an annual dividend of per share during fiscal no dividends had previously been paid 
the total amount of the special and annual dividends was million 
we plan to declare and pay an annual dividend during fiscal  however  future dividends are subject to the board of directors determination that the policy and the declaration of dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with applicable law

as of january   a total of  shares had been purchased under the program at a cost of approximately million  for an average cost of approximately per share 
as of january   approximately million remained available for repurchases under the stock repurchase program

john h 
marmaduke  the company s chief executive officer  the partnership may tender for purchase to the company  and  if so tendered  the company will be required to purchase  the number of shares of the company s common stock belonging to the partnership that equal an aggregate fair market value of million 
during this three year period  the partnership may elect to tender portions of such shares in various lots and parcels  at any time and from time to time  and any tender shall not exhaust or limit the partnership s right to tender an additional amount of such shares  subject to the limitations set within the stock transfer agreement

in addition  unused line fees ranging from to determined by reference to the level of usage under the credit agreement are also payable on unused commitments 
at january   we had approximately million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the credit agreement 
we expect to have approximately million to million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve and outstanding letters of credit  at january  however  excess availability may be reduced in the future as changes in the borrowing base occur or the lenders increase availability reserves

the aggregate amount of the letters of credit at january   was approximately million  which reduces the excess availability under the credit agreement 
at january   our minimum lease commitments for fiscal were approximately million 
total existing minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal years through were approximately million as of january  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we routinely enter into purchase commitments for various aspects of our operations  such as warehouse equipment and office equipment 
however  we do not believe that these commitments will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

for the fiscal year ended january   payments for taxes  insurance  maintenance  and other related expenses  which are variable in nature  were approximately million 
as of january   we were a party to revenue sharing arrangements with various studios 
these agreements include minimum purchase requirements  based upon the box office results of the title  at a lower initial product cost as compared to non revenue sharing purchases 
in addition  these contracts require net rental revenues to be shared with the studios over an agreed period of time 
we have included amounts owed and an estimate of our contractual obligation under these agreements for performance guarantees and minimum purchase requirements for the period in which they can reasonably be estimated  which is approximately two months in the future 
although these contracts may extend beyond the estimated two month period  we cannot reasonably estimate these amounts due to the uncertainty of purchases that will be made under these agreements 
the amounts presented above do not include revenue sharing accruals for rental revenues that will be recognized during fiscal uncertain tax position obligations  including unrecognized tax benefits of  as of january   were not included in this table 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of any future cash outflows related to uncertain tax position liabilities  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements during february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to a balance sheet account for example  inventory instead of directly to income or expense in the same reporting period
