overview of the company s activities and risks greene county bancorp  inc s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on greene county bancorp  inc s loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by greene county bancorp  inc s provision for loan losses  gains and losses from sales of securities  noninterest income and noninterest expense 
noninterest income consists primarily of fees and service charges 
greene county bancorp  inc s noninterest expense consists principally of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing  and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in interest rates  as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
additionally  future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially affect greene county bancorp  inc critical accounting policies greene county bancorp  inc s critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of securities for other than temporary impairment 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimation of an amount that is intended to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for the allowance of loan losses 
however  this evaluation involves a high degree of complexity and requires management to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
this critical accounting policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment by performing periodic reviews of individual securities in the investment portfolio 
greene county bancorp  inc makes an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss  is impaired on an other than temporary basis 
the company considers many factors  including the severity and duration of the impairment  the intent and ability of the company to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value  recent events specific to the issuer or industry  and for debt securities  the intent to sell the security  the likelihood to be required to sell the security before it recovers the entire amortized cost  external credit ratings and recent downgrades 
the company is required to record other than temporary impairment charges through earnings  if it has the intent to sell  or will more likely than not be required to sell an impaired debt security before a recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in addition  the company is required to record other than temporary impairment charges through earnings for the amount of credit losses  regardless of the intent or requirement to sell 
credit loss is measured as the difference between the present value of an impaired debt security s cash flows and its amortized cost basis 
non credit related write downs to fair value must be recorded as decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income as long as the company has no intent or requirement to sell an impaired security before a recovery of amortized cost basis 
management of credit risk management considers credit risk to be an important risk factor affecting the financial condition and operating results of greene county bancorp  inc the potential for loss associated with this risk factor is managed through a combination of policies approved by greene county bancorp  inc s board of directors  the monitoring of compliance with these policies  and the periodic reporting and evaluation of loans with problem characteristics 
policies relate to the maximum amount that can be granted to a single borrower and such borrower s related interests  the aggregate amount of loans outstanding by type in relation to total assets and capital  loan concentrations  loan to collateral value ratios  approval limits and other underwriting criteria 
policies also exist with respect to the rating of loans  determination of when loans should be placed on a nonperforming status and the factors to be considered in establishing greene county bancorp  inc s allowance for loan losses 
management also considers credit risk when evaluating potential and current holdings of securities 
credit risk is a critical component in evaluating corporate debt securities 
greene county bancorp  inc has purchased municipal securities as part of its strategy based on the fact that such securities can offer a higher tax equivalent yield than other similar investments 
management of interest rate risk while greene county bancorp  inc s loan portfolio  consisting primarily of mortgage loans collateralized by residential real property located in its market area  is subject to risks associated with the local economy  greene county bancorp  inc s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because most of greene county bancorp  inc s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
greene county bancorp  inc s assets consist primarily of residential mortgage loans  which have longer maturities than greene county bancorp  inc s liabilities  which consist primarily of deposits 
greene county bancorp  inc does not engage in any derivative based hedging transactions  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
due to the complex nature and additional risk often associated with derivative hedging transactions  such as counterparty risk  it is greene county bancorp  inc s policy to continue its strategy of mitigating interest rate risk through balance sheet composition 
greene county bancorp  inc s interest rate risk management program focuses primarily on evaluating and managing the composition of greene county bancorp  inc s assets and liabilities in the context of various interest rate scenarios 
factors beyond management s control  such as market interest rates and competition  also have an impact on interest income and interest expense 
in recent years  greene county bancorp  inc has followed the following strategies to manage interest rate risk i maintaining a high level of liquid interest earning assets such as short term federal funds sold and various investmen securities  ii maintaining a high concentration of less interest rate sensitive and lower costing core deposits  iii originating consumer installment loans that have up to five year terms but that have significantly shorter average lives due to early prepayments  iv originating adjustable rate commercial and home equity loans  and v where possible  matching the funding requirements for fixed rate residential mortgages with lower costing core deposits 
by investing in liquid securities  which can be sold to take advantage of interest rate shifts  and originating consumer installment loans with shorter average durations  greene county bancorp  inc believes it is better positioned to react to changes in market interest rates 
investments in short term securities  however  generally bear lower yields than longer term investments 
greene county bancorp  inc also attempts to offset interest rate risk by investing in adjustable rate securities  which will increase or decrease at periodic intervals based on a current interest rate 
thus  these strategies may result in lower levels of interest income than would be obtained by investing in longer term fixed rate investments 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is deemed to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position generally would not be in as favorable a position  compared with an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
the resulting yield on the institution s assets generally would increase at a slower rate than the increase in its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would tend to experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities which  consequently  would generally result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 
at june   greene county bancorp  inc s cumulative one year and three year gap positions  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and three years and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year and three years  as a percentage of total interest earning assets were positive and respectively 
certain shortcomings are inherent in this method of analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
it should also be noted that interest bearing core deposit categories  which have no stated maturity date  have an assumed decay rate applied to create a cash flow on those deposit categories for gap purposes 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the following table presents greene county bancorp  inc s economic value of equity eve 
the eve table indicates the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities at each specific rate shock environment 
the eve can be viewed as a form of the mark to market net worth of the statement of financial condition 
these calculations were based upon assumptions believed to be fundamentally sound  although they may vary from assumptions utilized by other financial institutions 
the information set forth below is based on data that included all financial instruments as of june  assumptions made by greene county bancorp  inc relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  core deposit duration  and the market values of certain assets and liabilities under the various interest rate scenarios 
actual maturity dates were used for fixed rate loans and certificate accounts 
securities were scheduled at either maturity date or next scheduled call date based upon judgment of whether the particular security would be called based upon the current interest rate environment  as it existed on june  variable rate loans were scheduled as of their next scheduled interest rate repricing date 
additional assumptions made in the preparation of the eve table include prepayment rates on loans and mortgage backed securities 
for each interest bearing core deposit category  a discounted cash flow based upon the decay of each category was calculated and a discount rate applied based on the fhlb fixed rate advance term nearest the average life of the category 
the noninterest bearing category does not use a decay assumption  and the month fhlb advance rate was used as the discount rate 
the eve at par represents the difference between greene county bancorp  inc s estimated value of assets and value of liabilities assuming no change in interest rates 
the eve for a decrease of  and basis points have been excluded since they would not be meaningful in the interest rate environment as of june  the following sets forth greene county bancorp  inc s eve as of june changes in market interest rates basis points dollars in thousands company eve change from par change from par eve ratio change bp bps bp bp par calculated as the estimated eve divided by the present value of total assets 
calculated as the excess deficiency of the eve ratio assuming the indicated change in interest rates over the estimated eve ratio assuming no change in interest rates 
as also indicated with the gap analysis  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in eve require the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
financial overview net income for the year ended june  amounted to million or per basic and per diluted share as compared to million or per basic and per diluted share for the year ended june   an increase of  or 
the increase in net income was primarily the result of an increase of  in net interest income and an increase of  in noninterest income  which was partially offset by a  increase in noninterest expense 
the increase in net interest income was the result of growth in the average balances of interest earning assets complemented by a decrease in average cost of interest bearing deposits  which was partially offset by a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets 
net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  despite increased net interest income from increased volume of loans and securities and a lower cost of funds  declines in the yields on interest earning assets resulted in our net interest spread and net interest margin decreasing when comparing the year ended june  and  respectively 
although the company has benefited from re pricing its interest bearing liabilities in the continuing historically low interest rate environment  the average interest rates earned on our loans and investments have similarly continued to re price into lower yields 
the increase in noninterest income was primarily the result of higher service charges on deposit accounts due to growth in the number of deposit accounts 
the increase in noninterest expense was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and employee benefits resulting from a  increase in expense related to the change to a self funded health insurance plan  and was partially offset by decreases in occupancy  equipment and furniture expenses and legal and professional fees of   and  respectively 
total assets grew million  or  to million at june  as compared to million at june  net loans increased million  or  to million at june  as compared to million at june  securities classified as both available for sale and held to maturity increased million to million at june  as compared to million at june  the increase in securities was the result of growth in deposits in excess of loan growth during the fiscal year ended june  deposits grew million  or  to million at june  as compared to million at june  of this growth in deposits  million consisted of growth in deposits with greene county commercial bank  and represented deposits by local municipalities 
it is required that securities be pledged as collateral for these deposits in excess of fdic insurance limits for these municipalities 
the remaining million in deposit growth was the result of an increase in retail deposits at the bank of greene county  and was due to continued growth in newer branches within our recently expanded market area 
total shareholders equity amounted to million at june   or of total assets  compared to million at june   or of total assets 
comparison of financial condition as of june  and june  securities securities available for sale and held to maturity increased million  or  to million at june  as compared to million at june  securities purchases totaled million during the year ended june  and consisted of million of state and political subdivision securities  million of us government sponsored enterprises  million of mortgage backed securities   of corporate securities and  of other securities

the loan growth experienced during the year consisted primarily of million in nonresidential real estate loans  million in residential mortgage loans  million in construction loans  and million in non mortgage loans  and was partially offset by a million decrease in home equity loans and a  increase in the allowance for loan loss 
the continued low interest rate environment and  we believe  strong customer satisfaction from personal service continued to enhance loan growth 
if long term rates begin to rise  the company anticipates some reduced new loan demand as well as refinancing activities 
the bank of greene county continues to use a conservative underwriting policy in regard to all loan originations  and does not engage in sub prime lending or other exotic loan products 
a significant decline in home values  however  in the company s market areas could have a negative effect on the consolidated results of operations  as any such decline in home values would likely lead to a decrease in residential real estate loans and new home equity loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults in both the consumer home equity loan and the residential real estate loan portfolios and result in increased losses in these portfolios 
updated appraisals are obtained on loans when there is a reason to believe that there has been a change in the borrower s ability to repay the loan principal and interest  generally  when a loan is in a delinquent status 
additionally  if an existing loan is to be modified or refinanced  generally  an appraisal is ordered to ensure continued collateral adequacy

loan maturity schedule 
the following table sets forth certain information as of june  regarding the amount of loans maturing or re pricing in the bank of greene county portfolio 
adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than the period in which they contractually mature  and fixed rate loans are included in the period in which the final contractual repayment is due 
lines of credit with no specified maturity date are included in the category within one year

the interest rate risk implications of the bank of greene county s substantial preponderance of fixed rate loans is discussed in detail above within the section management of interest rate risk 
potential problem loans management closely monitors the quality of the loan portfolio and has established a loan review process designed to help grade the quality and profitability of the company s loan portfolio 
the credit quality grade helps management make a consistent assessment of each loan relationship s credit risk 
consistent with regulatory guidelines  the bank of greene county provides for the classification of loans and other assets considered being of lesser quality 
such ratings coincide with the substandard  doubtful and loss classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions 
assets that do not currently expose the insured financial institutions to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but otherwise possess weaknesses are designated special mention
