intercompany transactions have been eliminated for the year ended december  financing general companies within the aep system generally use short term debt to finance working capital needs 
short term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions  construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long term debt 
in recent history  short term funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand  borrowing under aep revolving credit agreements and aep s commercial paper program 
funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program 
certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity

as of december   aep was in compliance with its debt covenants 
with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency  any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements 
a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in the annual reports  under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep s credit agreements 
aep s subsidiaries have also utilized  and expect to continue to utilize  additional financing arrangements  such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements  including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 
environmental and other matters general aep s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities with regard to air and water quality control and other environmental matters  and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities 
the environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 
clean air act requirements the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions 
the major caa programs affecting our power plants are described below 
the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 
the acid rain program the amendments to the caa include a cap and trade emission reduction program for so emissions from power plants 
by  the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so emissions of million tons per year  and required further reductions in the amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce nox emissions through the use of available combustion controls 
the success of the so cap and trade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs 
we continue to meet our obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls  use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets 
subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so and nox emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many of our facilities 
we have installed additional controls and taken other actions to achieve compliance with these programs 
national ambient air quality standards the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin 
the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them 
these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 
each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas 
each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas 
all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval 
if a state fails to develop adequate plans  the federal epa develops and implements a plan 
as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels  the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips 
in  the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 
the pm standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals  and a new rule was signed by the administrator in december that lowers the annual standard 
a new ozone standard is also under development and is expected to be proposed in the federal epa also adopted a new short term standard for so in  a lower standard for nox in  and a lower standard for lead in the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in the states will develop new sips for these standards  which could result in additional emission reductions being required from our facilities 
in  the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair  which requires additional reductions in so and nox emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs 
for additional information regarding cair  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues clean air act requirements 
in august  the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that would impose new and more stringent requirements to control so and nox emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating units in states and the district of columbia 
petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  and csapr was vacated 
cair remains in effect until the federal epa develops a replacement rule 
for additional information regarding csapr  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues clean air act requirements 
hazardous air pollutants as a result of the amendments to the caa  the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress  identifying mercury emissions from coal fired power plants as warranting further study 
in  the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oil fired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants 
for additional information regarding the utility mact  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues clean air act requirements 
regional haze the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas  including national parks  and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program 
in  the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr  detailing how the caa s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between and that emit more than tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories  including power plants 
pso is in the process of implementing a settlement with the federal epa in order to comply with the regional haze program requirements in that state 
for additional information regarding cavr and the regional haze program requirements  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues clean air act requirements 
co regulation in the absence of comprehensive climate change legislation  the federal epa has taken action to regulate co emissions under the existing requirements of the caa 
such actions are being legally challenged by numerous parties 
for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co emissions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues clean air act requirements 
our fossil fuel fired generating units are large sources of co emissions 
if substantial co emission reductions are required  there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older  less efficient  coal fired units 
to the extent we install additional controls on our generating plants to limit co emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase our rates  return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings 
prudently incurred capital investments made by our subsidiaries in rate regulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment 
we would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements 
however  requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can affect us adversely because our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates 
to the extent our costs are relatively higher than our competitors costs  it could reduce our off system sales or cause us to lose customers in jurisdictions that permit customers to choose their supplier of generation service 
several states have adopted programs that directly regulate co emissions from power plants  but none of these programs are currently in effect in states where we have generating facilities 
some of our states have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency  alternative energy  or renewable energy sources arkansas  indiana  louisiana  michigan  ohio  oklahoma  texas  virginia  and west virginia 
we are taking steps to comply with these requirements primarily through entering into power supply agreements giving us access to power generated by wind turbines 
clean water act requirements our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act  which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits  and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in our power plants 
in april  the federal epa issued a proposed rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that will reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water 
the proposed standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement 
compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule 
the proposed standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a site specific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment 
we submitted comments on the proposal in july and august we expect the federal epa to issue revised rules in the federal epa is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technology based standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act s national pollutant discharge elimination system program 
these standards were last updated over years ago  and the federal epa has issued two rounds of information collection requests to inform its rulemaking 
in october  the federal epa issued a final report for the power plant sector and determined that revisions to its existing standards are necessary 
we expect the federal epa to propose revised standards in until new standards are proposed  we cannot predict the outcome or impact of these rules on our operations 
coal ash regulation our operations produce a number of different coal combustion products  including fly ash  bottom ash  gypsum and other materials 
the federal epa completed an extensive study of the characteristics of coal ash in and concluded that combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous waste 
in december  the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties  prompting federal and state reviews of ash storage and disposal practices at many coal fired electric generating facilities  including ours 
aep operates ash ponds and we manage these ponds in a manner that complies with state and local requirements  including dam safety rules designed to assure the structural integrity of these facilities 
we also operate a number of dry disposal facilities in accordance with state standards  including ground water monitoring and other applicable standards 
in june  the federal epa published a proposed rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re use of coal combustion residuals  including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal fired electric generating units 
for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial re use of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on our operations  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues coal combustion residual rule 
climate change position and strategy we continue to support a federal legislative approach to energy policy as the most effective means of reducing emissions of co and other greenhouse gases generally referred to as co that recognizes that a reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to economic recovery and growth 
we do not believe regulating co emissions under the clean air act is the appropriate solution 
during the past decade  we have taken voluntary actions to reduce and offset our co emissions 
unfortunately  two of the voluntary programs that helped businesses such as aep to set quantitative commitments no longer exist 
the federal epa s climate leaders program and the chicago climate exchange both ended their reduction obligations at the end of however  through these programs and others  we voluntarily reduced our co emissions by approximately million metric tons during the to period 
we expect our emissions to continue to decline over time as we diversify our generating sources and operate fewer coal units 
the projected decline in coal fired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units  the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources  increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals 
our strategy for this transformation is to protect the reliability of the electric system and reduce our emissions by pursuing multiple options 
these include diversifying our fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas  increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources  where there is regulatory support 
meanwhile the federal epa began regulating co emissions from large stationary sources such as power plants in under the nsr prevention of significant deterioration and title v operating permit programs 
in march the federal epa proposed a carbon pollution standard for new power plants 
this regulation  based on epa authority under section b of the clean air act  would establish new source performance standards for co for new fossil fueled fired electric generating units 
the proposed regulation could limit the ability to construct new coal fired facilities in the future due to strict emission limits if finalized 
aep does not currently have plans to permit or construct any new coal fired facilities and the proposed rule does not directly impact existing facilities 
for additional information on legislative and regulatory responses to greenhouse gases  including limitations on co emissions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues climate change 
specific steps taken to reduce co emissions include the following renewable sources of energy some of our states have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency  alternative energy  or renewable energy sources arkansas  indiana  louisiana  michigan  ohio  oklahoma  texas  virginia  and west virginia 
at the end of and in support of our goals or requirements  the company had long term contracts for  mw of wind and mw of solar power for a combined total of  mw to serve its regulated operating company customers 
we actively manage our compliance position and are on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 
end user energy efficiency in  aep established a goal to reduce demand by  megawatts mw and energy consumption by  megawatt hours mwh by the end of since that time  aep operating companies have implemented a wide variety of new consumer programs across most of the states we serve 
over energy efficiency and demand response programs and tariffs are now in place 
preliminary estimates indicate that we have achieved our goal 
from through  aep achieved  mwh of energy reduction and  mw of demand reduction  or and of goal  respectively 
for the same period  aep operating companies have invested over million in energy efficiency and demand response initiatives 
final results are subject to independent third party evaluation and verification of savings  as required in some jurisdictions 
energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states we serve  and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for us to continue and expand these consumer offerings 
appropriate recovery of program costs  lost revenues  and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments 
going forward  we will work closely with regulators to ensure that plans are in place to meet specific regulatory and legislative energy efficiency and or demand reduction targets present in the respective jurisdictions 
gridsmart aep s gridsmart initiative is designed to demonstrate the potential benefits of the smart grid by integrating advanced grid technologies into existing electric networks 
aep is deploying smart grid technologies in several jurisdictions with regulatory support 
aep ohio is deploying a comprehensive suite of smart grid technologies in an innovative demonstration project with  customers 
the million project is being funded through a million federal grant  puco cost recovery support and vendor in kind contributions 
aep texas is deploying a one million meter smart grid network  along with million in energy use display devices for low income customers 
the million project is targeted for completion by the end of we are recovering the costs through an year surcharge 
i m has deployed a smart grid network to  customers 
the million project was funded pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by the iurc 
pso has deployed smart meters to approximately  customers   of which will be served on circuits equipped with advanced grid management technologies 
the project is being financed through a million american reinvestment and recovery act low interest loan from the oklahoma department of commerce with million annual revenues for cost recovery approved by the oklahoma corporation commission 
current and projected co emission our total co emissions in not including our ownership in the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately million metric tons 
our emissions decreased to approximately million metric tons 
we expect overall increases in co emissions during the next few years to be small  if any  as our sales and generation rebound somewhat from recession lows in however  over much of the remainder of the decade we expect emissions to decline as modest sales growth is offset by retirements of older  less efficient coal fired units and increased utilization of natural gas 
corporate governance in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of our strategic plan  our board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by our actions 
the board of directors is informed of any new material environmental issues  including changes to regulations and proposed legislation 
the board s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company s annual corporate accountability report  which includes information on environmental issues 
other environmental issues and matters we are engaged in litigation regarding regulated air emissions and or whether emissions from coal fired generating plants cause or contribute to global warming 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled litigation environmental issues and note to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments  guarantees and contingencies  included in the annual reports  for further information 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites  as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites 
see note to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments  guarantees and contingencies  included in the annual reports  under the heading entitled the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation for further information 
environmental investments investments related to improving aep system plants environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during  and and the current estimates for  and are shown below  in each case excluding equity afudc and capitalized interest 
estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints  environmental regulations  business opportunities  market volatility  economic trends and the ability to access capital 
aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls 
such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after or have been proposed and may be adopted 
future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co becomes regulated at existing facilities 
while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies  replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices  without such recovery  those costs could impact future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws  regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled environmental issues and note to the consolidated financial statements  entitled commitments  guarantees and contingencies  included in the annual reports  for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 
historical and projected environmental investments actual actual actual estimate estimate estimate in thousands total aep system a apco i m opco pso swepco b a includes expenditures of the subsidiaries shown and other subsidiaries not shown 
the figures reflect construction expenditures  not investments in subsidiary companies 
b swepco actual environmental cost includes reclassifications of project costs for suspended capital projects 
the preceding discussion of environmental investments and plans for future years reflects the ownership of plants as of december  the aep east companies have filed with the ferc to terminate the interconnection agreement and for opco to transfer facilities to apco  kpco and aepgenco 
management expects the transfers will be effective december  electric and magnetic fields emf emf are found everywhere there is electricity 
electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges 
magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges 
this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines  electrical equipment  household wiring and appliances 
a number of studies in the past have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf 
while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects  none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 
management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects 
if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems  or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages  or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed  then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 
utility operations general utility operations constitute most of aep s business operations 
utility operations include a the generation  transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and b the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies  municipalities and other market participants 
aepsc  as agent for aep s public utility subsidiaries  performs marketing  generation dispatch  fuel procurement and power related risk management and trading activities 
electric generation facilities as of december   aep s public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately  mw of domestic generation 
see item properties for more information regarding aep s generation capacity 
interconnection agreement apco  i m  kpco  opco and aepsc are parties to the interconnection agreement  which was originally approved by the ferc in and subsequently amended in    twice and this agreement defines how the member companies share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants 
this sharing is based upon each company s member load ratio 
the member load ratio is calculated monthly by dividing each company s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all member companies 
the member load ratio multiplied by the aggregate generation capacity of all the member companies determines each member company capacity obligation 
the difference between each member company obligation and its own generation capacity determines the capacity surplus or deficit of each member company 
the agreement requires the deficit companies to make monthly capacity equalization payments to the surplus companies based on the surplus companies average fixed cost of generation 
member companies that deliver energy to other member companies to meet their internal load requirements are reimbursed at average variable costs 
in addition  all member companies share off system sales margins based upon each member company member load ratio 
consequently  the agreement provides a strong risk sharing and mitigation arrangement among the member companies 
as of december   the member load ratios were as follows peak demand member load ratio mws apco i m kpco opco apco  i m  kpco and opco are parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement  which has been approved by the ferc and provides  among other things  for the transfer of so emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement

see note to the consolidated financial statements  entitled rate matters  included in the annual reports  for additional information regarding the termination of the interconnection agreement and transfer of opco s generation assets 
csw operating agreement pso  swepco and aepsc are parties to the csw operating agreement  which has been approved by the ferc 
the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments 
parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids more costly alternatives 
revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties 
the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands pso swepco power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale except in ohio  where generation rates are currently priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market 
see regulation rates under item  utility operations 
under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement  power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries 
see risk management and trading  below  for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 
aep s system integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of aep s east companies  pso and swepco 
this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution  between the two zones  of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities 
it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement  each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone 
risk management and trading as agent for aep s public utility subsidiaries  aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power  natural gas  coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates and in adjacent regions 
these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent  natural gas  coal and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices 
these contracts include physical transactions  exchange traded futures  and to a lesser extent  over the counter swaps and options 
the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts 
these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 
counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions 
as of december   counterparties posted approximately million in cash  cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep s public utility subsidiaries while  as of that date  aep s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately million with counterparties and exchanges 
since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities  exposures change daily

fuel supply the following table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system coal and lignite natural gas nuclear hydroelectric and other a price increase decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreased increased use of other fuels 
aep s overall fossil fuel costs are down approximately on a dollar per mmbtu basis from due primarily to the favorable impact of low natural gas prices 
coal and lignite aep s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long term contracts  affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms 
coal consumption in was down significantly from the same period in for the reasons discussed below 
the aep system average target level for coal inventory ranges from to days and as of december   the aep system average for coal inventories was days 
management believes that aep s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite fired units 
through subsidiaries  aep owns  leases or controls more than  railcars  approximately barges  towboats  and a coal handling terminal with approximately million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities 
see aep river operations for a discussion of aep s for profit coal and other dry bulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep s utility operations segment 
spot market prices for certain coals utilized by aep decreased significantly in the first half of  but made a modest recovery by the end of the year 
the general decrease in spot coal prices during the year can be attributed to the persistently weak demand for domestic coal driven  in large part  by low natural gas prices and the displacement of coal generation with natural gas resources 
most of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts 
as those contracts expire  they can be replaced at the new market price with an impact in subsequent periods 
the average cost per ton for coal delivered in increased from the prior year 
the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by aep system companies total coal delivered to aep system plants thousands of tons average cost per ton of coal delivered the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors  including  but not limited to  demand for electric power  unit outages  transportation infrastructure limitations  space limitations  plant coal consumption rates  availability of acceptable coals  labor issues and weather conditions  which may interrupt production or deliveries 
as of december   the aep system s coal inventory was approximately days of full load burn 
natural gas through its public utility subsidiaries  aep consumed nearly billion cubic feet of natural gas during for generating power 
this represents an increase of from and continues a trend that began in since  aep s natural gas consumption has increased approximately 
the increased natural gas consumption is attributable to the addition of the stall and dresden natural gas combined cycle units in june and january  respectively  along with increased operation of the lawrenceburg and waterford combined cycle units 
the efficient heat rates of these units low  british thermal units kwh range coupled with sustained lower natural gas prices have supported the increased operation of aep s combined cycle natural gas units 
a mild winter and the continuation of high levels of production from shale gas developments led to higher us natural gas inventories and continued to place downward pressure on natural gas prices as a result of more abundant supplies  making power generated from these units more economic 
several of aep s natural gas fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines  which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability 
a portfolio of term  monthly  seasonal firm and daily peaking commodity and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant  as appropriate 
the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by aep system companies total natural gas delivered to aep system plants billion cubic feet average price per mmbtu of purchased natural gas nuclear i m has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant 
i m has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot  short term and mid term markets 
i m also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel 
for purposes of the storage of high level radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel  i m completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than years ago 
i m entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue 
i m is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis 
i m began and completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in  which consisted of casks spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each 
nuclear waste and decommissioning as the owner of the cook plant  i m has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely 
the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program 
the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in in it  the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low level radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from billion to billion in non discounted dollars 
as of december   the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately billion 
the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns 
the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the type of decommissioning plan selected 
escalation of various cost elements including  but not limited to  general inflation and the cost of energy 
further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning 
technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies 
availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities 
availability of a united states department of energy facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel 
accordingly  management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections 
we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  entitled commitments  guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies  included in the annual reports  for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 
low level radioactive waste the low level waste policy act of mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low level radioactive waste rests with the individual states 
low level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials 
michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available 
i m cannot predict when such a site may be available 
however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators 
there is currently no set date limiting i m s access to either of these facilities 
the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste 
in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable  then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility 
structured arrangements involving capacity  energy and ancillary services in january  opco and national power cooperatives npc  an affiliate of buckeye  entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a mw gas fired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc  called the mone plant

rates historically  state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost of service basis  which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service 
a utility s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses  including operation and maintenance expense  depreciation expense and taxes 
state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility s level of investment 
absent a legal limitation  such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time  a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative 
some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility  customer  governmental or other representative of a group of customers 
such parties may  however  agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 
public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service 
provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment  it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery 
given long lead times in construction  the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets  we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow 
aep representatives continue to engage our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process 
these options include pre approvals  a return on construction work in progress  rider trackers  formula rates and the inclusion of future test year projections into rates 
in many jurisdictions  the rates of aep s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie  generation  transmission and distribution service 
in the ercot area of texas  our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled cost based rates for transmission and distribution service only 
in ohio  rates for electric service are unbundled for generation  transmission and distribution service 
historically  the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or  more recently  unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility s rates and tariffs 
fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 
the following state by state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates 
several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  entitled rate matters  included in the annual reports  for more information regarding pending rate matters 
indiana i m provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc  with rates set on a cost of service basis 
indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 
ohio opco provides default retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio electric restructuring legislation 
opco provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost based rates approved by the puco or by the ferc 
while ohio transmission and distribution services continue to be established using more traditional cost based methods  generation rates are currently priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market 
we are seeking regulatory approval from the ferc to transfer the ohio generation assets to a newly formed wholly owned competitive ohio generation affiliate as of january  the recovery of those generation assets will be subject to market prices starting in mid may oklahoma pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ 
pso s rates are set on a cost of service basis 
fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatt hour sales 
the factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs 
over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 
texas retail customers in tcc s and tnc s ercot service area of texas are served through reps 
tcc and tnc provide transmission and distribution service on a cost of service basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules 
effective september  competition in the spp area of texas has been delayed until certain steps defined by statute and by puct rule have been accomplished 
as such  the puct continues to approve base and fuel rates for swepco s texas operations on a cost of service basis 
virginia apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the virginia scc 
virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause 
transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 
in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery  apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 
west virginia apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc  with rates set on a cost of service basis

ferc under the federal power act  the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale  transmission of electric power  accounting and other matters  including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects 
the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at ferc approved rates 
the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers 
the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices 
except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its balancing area of the spp  aep has market rate authority from the ferc  under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place 
the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to  directly or through an rto  file an open access network and point to point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility s own uses of its transmission system 
the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities  directly or through an rto  to establish an open access same time information system  which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices  and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities transmission employees from providing non public transmission information to the utility s marketing employees 
the ferc oversees rtos  entities created to operate  plan and control utility transmission assets

the aep east companies are members of pjm 
swepco and pso are members of spp 
the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of our public utility subsidiaries  the acquisition of securities of utilities  the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company

competition under current ohio law  electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service 
cres providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service 
in  based upon an average annual load  approximately of our ohio load had switched to cres providers 
as of december   that amount had increased to 
the public utility subsidiaries of aep  like the electric industry generally  face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis  primarily to other public utilities and power marketers 
the energy policy act of was designed  among other things  to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services 
as a result  there are more generators able to participate in this market 
the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs  availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 
aep s public utility subsidiaries also compete with self generation and with distributors of other energy sources  such as natural gas  fuel oil and coal  within their service areas 
the primary factors in such competition are price  reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 
with respect to competing generators and self generation  the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position 
with respect to alternative sources of energy  the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other cost effective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position  even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 
significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states  including those served by the aep system 
some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power 
in addition  industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs  which may include  among other things  the cost of electric power 
the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through  for example  providing various off peak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with  and approved by  the various state commissions 
occasionally  these rates are negotiated with the customer  and then filed with the state commissions for approval 
seasonality the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business 
in many parts of the country  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
in other areas  power demand peaks during the winter 
the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters 
in addition  aep has historically sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep s results of operations and may impact its financial condition 
conversely  unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep s results of operations 
transmission operations aeptco overview aeptco  a subsidiary of aep  is a holding company for seven ferc regulated transmission only electric utilities  each of which is geographically aligned with our existing utility operating companies

in october  aeptco completed a million debt offering and immediately loaned million and million in proceeds to ohtco and imtco  respectively 
in december  aeptco issued an additional million in debt and immediately loaned the proceeds to oktco 
aptco will issue an additional million in march but it is not yet determined which subsidiaries of aeptco will receive the proceeds 
transmission development through the transcos is primarily driven by improvements to local area reliability by upgrading  rebuilding or replacing existing  aging infrastructure 
construction of new facilities to support both customer points of delivery and generation interconnections and new facilities required to maintain grid reliability associated with generation resource retirements 
projects assigned as a result of the regional planning initiatives conducted by pjm and spp 
pjm and spp identify the need for transmission in support of regional reliability  congestion reduction and the integration of supply side resources primarily renewable and retirements of generation facilities 
regulatory environment the transcos establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to the ferc approved formula rate implementation protocols 
ferc has a formal review process in place to ensure updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated 
the annual updates are submitted to pjm and spp  respectively  for public posting on their respective websites and submitted to ferc in an informational filing 
any interested party may participate in the review of the annual update and must comply with defined timelines to request additional information on such rate updates 
an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider s transmission system for the transcos  pjm or spp 
ferc requires transmission providers to offer transmission service to all eligible customers ie  load serving entities  power marketers  generators  and customers in states with supplier choice on a non discriminatory basis 
the pjm and spp oatts provide standard terms and conditions to ensure consistent service availability and treatment of all transmission customers 
the transcos rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp 
pjm and spp collect the transcos rates from transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts  based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatts for the service taken 
some charges are directly assigned to a transmission customer  but the majority of the charges are paid by transmission customers taking transmission service to serve load  deliver power  or to connect generation resources 
the ferc establishes transmission service rates for transmission owners including the transcos  as derived from their annual transmission revenue requirement atrr 
each of the transcos atrr establishes rates for a one year period based on the current projects in service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe 
the atrr also includes a true up calculation during the annual formula update for the previous year s billings  eliminating any potential for over or under recovery of the allowed return on and of the plant in service 
the transcos collectively filed rate base increases of million and million for and  respectively 
the total transmission revenue requirement filed in the atrr for and equaled million and million  respectively 
the cost of service formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of based on a capital structure of up to equity for the aep east transmission companies 
the aep west transmission companies are allowed a return on equity of based on a capital structure of up to equity 
the authorized returns on equity for the transcos are commensurate with the ferc authorized returns on equity in the pjm and spp oatts  respectively  for aep s utility subsidiaries 
joint venture initiatives aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing  building  and owning extra high voltage ehv transmission lines that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america 
our joint ventures are at various stages of regulatory and rto approval 
ett  our largest joint venture  was established with midamerican energy holdings company midamerican to construct  fund  own and operate electric transmission assets within ercot  including transmission projects in the competitive renewable energy zone crez 
the puct has awarded approximately billion of total crez investment to ett 
aep has a ownership interest in ett 
electric transmission america eta is a joint venture between aep and midamerican to build and own electric transmission assets 
prairie wind transmission  a joint venture between eta and westar energy  began construction of a kansas ehv transmission project in the approximately million project is expected to be in service by the end of aep has a ownership interest in eta and a interest in prairie wind through its ownership interest in eta 
pioneer transmission  llc pioneer is a joint venture between aep and duke energy 
aep has a ownership interest in pioneer 
the first segment of pioneer s proposed line linking duke energy s greentown station to aep s rockport station was included in the miso transmission expansion plan as a multi value project mvp 
subject to regulatory approval  pioneer has agreed to jointly develop the first segment with northern indiana public service company as part of the settlement of a dispute regarding the rights to develop the project 
the remaining portion of the project will be evaluated by miso and pjm as part of their next planning review cycles 
the estimated cost to complete the entire pioneer project is million 
riteline transmission development  llc rtd is a joint venture between aep and exelon 
aep owns of rtd 
riteline indiana  llc riteline in is a joint venture between aep and rtd 
aep  directly and indirectly through rtd  has an ownership interest in riteline in 
riteline illinois  llc riteline il is a joint venture between rtd and commonwealth edison 
through its ownership interest in rtd  aep has a interest in riteline il 
the riteline project companies will build and operate approximately miles of high voltage transmission lines and related facilities in indiana with a projected cost of million and illinois with a projected cost of billion 
rtd received an order from the ferc in october granting incentives for the riteline in and riteline il projects 
the projects are currently under evaluation by pjm 
transource energy  llc transource  a joint venture between aep and great plains energy  was formed in primarily to pursue competitive transmission projects in the pjm  spp and miso transmission regions 
its first two projects are the iatan nashua project and the sibley nebraska city project  which were approved by the spp in and  respectively 
aep has an ownership interest  and great plains energy incorporated holds a minority ownership interest  in transource 
business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and other aep subsidiaries and the joint venture partners 
therefore  the joint ventures do not have any employees 
for the equity investments within our transmission operations segment  we forecast approximately million of aep equity contributions in to support construction expenditures and the payment of operating expenses 
aep river operations our aep river operations segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio  illinois and lower mississippi rivers 
almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses 
we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit 
depending on market conditions and other factors  including barge availability  we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost 
our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants 
aep river operations includes approximately  barges  towboats and harbor boats that we own or lease 
these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment 
see item utility operations electric generation fuel supply coal and lignite 
competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense  with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve 
we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates  but also with respect to customer service  available routes  value added services including scheduling convenience and flexibility 
the industry continues to experience consolidation 
the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers 
demand for barging services can be seasonal  particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall 
cold winter weather  water levels and inefficient older river locks operated by others may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed or commercial traffic is limited 
our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard  federal laws  state laws and certain international conventions 
legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 
generation and marketing our generation and marketing segment consists of nonutility generating assets  a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business 
with respect to our wholesale energy trading and marketing business  we enter into short and long term transactions to buy or sell capacity  energy and ancillary services primarily in ercot  pjm and miso 
as of december   the assets utilized in this segment included approximately mw of company owned domestic wind power facilities  mw of domestic wind power from long term purchase power agreements and mw of coal fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through that transfers tnc s interest in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners  inc the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot 
we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot 
while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer  we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations 
with respect to our retail supply and energy management business  aep energy is a retail electricity supplier that supplies electricity to residential  commercial  and industrial customers 
aep energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in illinois  pennsylvania  delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio and washington  dc aep energy also provides energy demand side management solutions nationwide 
aep energy had more than  customer accounts as of december  executive officers of aep as of february  the following persons are executive officers of aep

risk factors general risks of our regulated operations we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions 
affecting each registrant our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions  including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits  construction of additional transmission facilities  modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives 
our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions 
if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge  we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment 
this would cause our financial results to be diminished 
while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment  there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts  particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 
approval of the new esp order in ohio may be overturned 
affecting aep and opco in august  the puco issued an order which adopted and modified a new esp through may the esp allowed the continuation of the fuel adjustment clause and established a non bypassable distribution investment rider effective september through may to recover  with certain caps  post august distribution investment 
the esp also maintained recovery of several previous esp riders and approved a storm damage recovery mechanism which allowed opco to defer the majority of the incremental distribution operation and maintenance costs from storms 
in january  the puco issued its order on rehearing for the esp which generally upheld its august order 
the puco addressed certain issues around the energy auctions while other sso issues were deferred to a separate docket 
comments on the rehearing order are permitted to be filed by intervenors through march if the puco reverses all or part of the esp rehearing order  it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
we may not fully collect deferred capacity costs 
affecting aep and opco the puco adopted and modified the new esp and established a non bypassable retail stability rider rsr 
a portion of the rsr provides for the collection of deferred capacity costs 
the deferred capacity costs may exceed the amount we will collect under the rsr 
in addition  the industrial energy users ohio filed a claim before the supreme court of ohio stating  among other things  that opco s recovery of its capacity costs is illegal 
if opco is ultimately not permitted to fully collect its deferred capacity costs  it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
we may not recover deferred fuel costs 
affecting aep and opco in august  the puco ordered recovery of deferred fuel costs beginning september through the phase in recovery rider 
the august order was upheld by the puco in october opco and intervenors have filed appeals at the supreme court of ohio 
if the supreme court of ohio does not permit full recovery of opco s deferred fuel costs  it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
prior esp rate recovery approved in ohio may have to be returned  may not provide full recovery of costs and is subject to appeal 
affecting aep and opco the puco issued an order in march that modified and approved the prior esp which established rates through the prior esp order generally authorized rate increases during the esp period  subject to caps that limited the rate increases  and also provided a fuel adjustment clause for the three year period of that esp 
there remain three risks associated with this prior approved recovery a amounts collected by us for the years and are subject to an excessive earnings test administered by the puco  which could require us to refund amounts to customers  b the recovery under the fuel adjustment clause includes significant deferrals of costs associated with an interim arrangement with a major steel producing customer and is subject to the puco s ultimate decision regarding those deferrals plus related carrying charges  and c intervenors are challenging various issues at the supreme court of ohio  asserting that charges that the puco reversed going forward also should have been reversed retrospectively and challenging various aspects of approved environmental carrying charges 
if the puco and or the supreme court of ohio reverses all or part of the rate recovery or if deferred amounts are not recovered for other reasons  it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
ohio may require us to refund additional fuel costs 
affecting aep and opco in january  the puco ordered that proceeds from a coal contract settlement agreement be applied against opco s under recovered fuel balance and that an outside consultant be hired to review our fuel procurement through the audit by the outside consultant included recommendations that would limit some of our fuel recovery or require us to refund certain fuel costs already incurred 
in addition  an intervenor filed a claim for refund of certain fuel costs with the supreme court of ohio 
if the puco orders result in a reduction to our fuel recovery and or the supreme court of ohio ultimately determines to grant all or part of the requested refund  it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
we may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to the turk plant affecting aep and swepco in december  swepco placed the turk plant in arkansas into commercial operation 
swepco holds a ownership interest in the mw coal fired generating facility 
swepco had originally intended that mw of the turk plant would become part of the rate base for its retail customers in arkansas 
following a proceeding at the arkansas supreme court  the apsc issued an order which reversed and set aside a previously granted certificate of environmental compatibility and public need 
this portion of the turk plant output is currently not subject to cost based rate recovery and is being sold into the spp market 
swepco has included a request to recover a portion of the costs of the turk plant in its base rate case filed in texas and has made a formula rate filing with the lpsc  and a subsequent settlement seeking recovery for a portion of the costs of the turk plant 
if swepco cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the turk plant either through retail rates or sales into the spp market  it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
we may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to extending the useful life of the cook plant affecting aep and i m in april and may  i m filed a petition with the iurc and the mpsc  respectively  for approval of the cook plant life cycle management project lcm project  which consists of a group of capital projects for cook plant units and intended to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the plant through its licensed life 
the estimated cost of the lcm project is billion to be incurred through  excluding afudc 
as of december   i m has incurred million related to the lcm project  including afudc 
if i m is not ultimately permitted to recover its lcm project costs  it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
request for rate recovery in texas may not be approved in its entirety 
affecting aep and swepco in july  swepco filed a request with the puct for an annual increase in texas base rates 
a portion of the increase seeks recovery for costs associated with the construction and operation of the texas jurisdictional share approximately of the turk plant 
in april  the texas industrial energy consumers filed a petition for review at the supreme court of texas contending that the turk plant is unnecessary to serve retail customers 
the supreme court of texas has requested full briefing from the parties 
if swepco cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the turk plant  it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
our transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities 
affecting aep we expect that a growing portion of our earnings in the future will derive from the transmission investments and activities of aeptco and our transmission joint ventures 
ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction 
if ferc were to adopt a different policy or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected  our strategy of investing in transmission could be curtailed 
we believe our experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives us an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install  construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities 
however  there can be no assurance that pjm  spp or other rtos will authorize any new transmission projects or will award any such projects to us 
if the ferc were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for our transmission investments and facilities  it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
we may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled 
affecting each registrant our business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks  including construction delays  nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers  and increases in equipment and labor costs 
to limit the risks of these construction projects  we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and or siting or environmental permits 
if any of these projects is canceled for any reason  including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and or siting or environmental permits  we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts 
in addition  if we have recorded any construction work or investments as an asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 
rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements  additions  storm damage operations and maintenance expense repairs and other costs 
affecting each registrant our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions 
these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility s expenses incurred in a test year 
thus  commission approved rates may or may not match a utility s expenses at any given time 
there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered 
traditionally  we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service 
provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment  the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery 
similarly  we often finance the operations and maintenance expense to repair facilities damaged by storms or other severe weather events until the operations and maintenance storm costs  including any deferred regulatory assets  are recovered in rates 
long lead times in construction and scheduled repairs  the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments  repairs and improvements 
while we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow  including pre approvals  a return on construction work in progress  rider trackers  formula rates and the inclusion of future test year projections into rates  there can be no assurance that these will be adopted  that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner 
certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control 
affecting each registrant our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions 
material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities  however  could negatively impact our revenues  operating and capital expenditures and results of operations 
such events may also create additional risks related to the supply and or cost of equipment and materials 
we could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events  including  but not limited to major facility or equipment failure 
an environmental event such as a serious spill or release 
fires  floods  droughts  earthquakes  hurricanes  tornados or other natural disasters 
wars  terrorist acts including cyber terrorism or threats and other catastrophic events 
significant health impairments or disease events 
other serious operational problems 
we are exposed to nuclear generation risk 
affecting aep and i m through i m  we own the cook plant 
it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of  mw  or about of the generating capacity in the aep system 
we are  therefore  subject to the risks of nuclear generation  which include the following the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel 
limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations 
uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others 
uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives 
there can be no assurance that i m s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours 
in addition  although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants  if an incident did occur  it could harm our results of operations or financial condition 
a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 
moreover  a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 
costs associated with the operation including fuel  maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation  in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards  availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities 
costs also may include replacement power  any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature  the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs 
our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 
the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures  which could affect our performance in these regions 
affecting each registrant our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets 
the rules governing the various regional power markets  including spp and pjm  may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues 
because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear  we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 
we could be subject to higher costs and or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards 
affecting each registrant as a result of epact  owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc 
these standards  which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis  became mandatory in june the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles 
compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and or increased capital expenditures 
while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates  there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner 
if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards  we could be subject to sanctions  including substantial monetary penalties  which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 
risks related to market  economic or financial volatility and other risks our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions 
affecting each registrant our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation  transmission and distribution facilities 
operating these facilities involves many risks  including operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes 
operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements 
labor disputes 
compliance with mandatory reliability standards  including mandatory cyber security standards 
information technology failure that impairs our information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations 
information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims 
fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints  adverse weather such as drought  non performance by our suppliers and other factors 
catastrophic events such as fires  earthquakes  explosions  hurricanes  tornados  ice storms  terrorism including cyber terrorism  floods or other similar occurrences 
hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations  lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage our reputation 
affecting each registrant we own assets deemed as critical infrastructure  the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems 
further  the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks 
parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems  software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack 
in addition  our business requires that we collect and maintain sensitive customer data  as well as confidential employee and shareholder information  which is subject to electronic theft or loss 
a successful cyber attack on the systems that control our generation  transmission  distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations  preventing us from serving customers or collecting revenues 
the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record  process and report financial information 
a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation  fines  other remedial action  heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation 
in addition  the misappropriation  corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring 
we maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third party injuries caused by potential cybersecurity incidents 
however  other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 
for these reasons  a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
in an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions  we have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality  integrity and availability of data and systems 
in addition  we are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements 
however  cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt  and  as a result  there is a risk that we could experience a successful cyber attack despite our current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts 
if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms  it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
affecting each registrant we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows 
volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs  including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness 
in addition  if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours  capital costs could increase materially 
restricted access to capital markets and or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and or to operate our power trading businesses 
affecting each registrant the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings 
any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations 
our business is capital intensive  and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive 
in periods of market turmoil  access to capital is difficult for all borrowers 
if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained  our interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 
our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries senior unsecured long term debt or on the investment grade ratings of aep parent 
most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions 
if those ratings were to decline below investment grade  our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cash related instruments which would reduce our profits 
aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries 
affecting aep aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own 
its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries  primarily its regulated utilities  and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to  or repay loans from  aep 
its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions or other payments 
payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep could be subject to regulatory restrictions 
aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations  if any 
our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions 
affecting each registrant electric power generation is generally a seasonal business 
in many parts of the country  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
in other areas  power demand peaks during the winter 
as a result  our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into 
in addition  we have historically sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 
conversely  unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 
further  deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers  particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely  while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues 
as a result  our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions 
failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations 
affecting each registrant certain events  such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements  mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs  or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs 
the challenges include lack of resources  loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development 
in this case  costs  including costs for contractors to replace employees  productivity costs and safety costs  may rise 
failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees  including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees  or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business 
if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce  our results of operations could be negatively affected 
parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations  which could harm our results of operations 
affecting each registrant our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions  including the installation of environmental upgrades  construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives 
we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction 
we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and or obtain the required construction related services 
as a result  we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects 
although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty  our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions 
this would cause our financial results to be diminished  and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 
changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power  harming our financial performance 
affecting each registrant we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coal fired 
we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity  but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored  we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts 
similarly  we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances 
we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures 
as long as current environmental programs remain in effect  we have sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of our projected needs for the next two years and beyond 
if the federal epa is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport  and it is acceptable by the courts  additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions 
if we need to obtain allowances under a replacement rule  those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs 
our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 
we also own natural gas fired facilities which exposes us to market prices of natural gas 
historically  natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources 
recently however  the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility 
our ability to make off system sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas 
as the price of natural gas falls  other market participants that utilize natural gas fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our off system sales prices  so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and  on occasion  we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants 
we expect the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas 
prices for coal  natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the past 
changes in the cost of coal  emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results 
in addition  actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions  and those differences may be material 
as a result  our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 
our aep river operations business segment cannot operate if river levels are too low or too high 
affecting aep our aep river operations business segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio  illinois and lower mississippi rivers 
if drought conditions or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to drop below the amount necessary to permit commercial barging traffic  it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river 
conversely  if unusually high amounts of precipitation or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to be too high to permit commercial barging traffic  it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river 
extreme water levels that do not close river basin commercial traffic can still harm our business if the levels curtail the total volume permitted to move on the affected river 
the levels on portions of the mississippi river in have been reported as the lowest since the levels caused by severe drought in any reduction in the commercial activities of our aep river operations due to low water levels could reduce future net income and cash flows 
risks relating to state restructuring we are unable to fully predict the effects of corporate separation in ohio and ohio generation becoming subject to market forces 
affecting aep and opco while ohio rates for transmission and distribution services continue to be established using a more traditional cost based method  in october  the puco approved opco s corporate separation plan to transfer its generation assets to a new competitive  unregulated generation affiliate 
during this transition  generation rates will be priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market 
starting in mid  generation rates will be subject entirely to market prices 
we have made additional filings at the ferc and other state commissions related to this corporate separation 
if all regulatory approvals are received  our results of operations related to generation previously held by opco will be largely determined by the prevailing market conditions 
we can give no assurance that the ferc will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving our corporate separation filings 
additionally  some of these generation units may no longer be cost effective and may be retired prior to the end of their anticipated useful life 
this could result in material impairments 
we are unable to fully predict the effects of terminating the interconnection agreement 
affecting aep  apco  i m and opco in october  we submitted several filings with the ferc seeking approval to fully separate opco s generating assets from its distribution and transmission operations 
the filings requested approval to transfer approximately  mw of opco owned generation assets to a new competitive  unregulated generation affiliate 
we also requested approval from the ferc and  as applicable  the kpsc  the virginia scc and the wvpsc to transfer  mw of opco owned generation assets to apco and mw of opco owned generation assets to kpco 
additionally  we asked for ferc approval to terminate the existing interconnection agreement and to authorize a new power coordination agreement among apco  i m and kpco 
a decision from the ferc is expected in mid significant gaps could emerge if the interconnection agreement is terminated without approval of the generation asset transfers and or the new power coordination agreement 
surplus members would no longer automatically sell to deficit members  and they may not be able to otherwise sell that surplus in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the interconnection agreement 
conversely  deficit members would no longer automatically purchase from surplus members  and they may not be able to otherwise purchase in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the interconnection agreement 
the possible loss of these sales by the surplus members and the potential increase in costs for the deficit members could reduce future net income and cash flows 
in addition  we can give no assurance that the ferc or other state commissions will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving these arrangements and asset transfers 
customers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers  as allowed by ohio law and regulation 
affecting aep and opco under current ohio law  electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service 
cres providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service 
as of december   based upon an average annual load  approximately of our ohio load had switched to cres providers 
these evolving market conditions will continue to impact our results of operations 
collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps 
affecting aep our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers 
currently  we do business with approximately one hundred reps 
in  tcc s largest rep accounted for of its operating revenue and its second largest rep accounted for of its operating revenue  tnc s largest rep accounted for of its operating revenues and its second largest rep accounted for of its operating revenues 
adverse economic conditions  structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments 
we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments 
any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and impact financial condition 
risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power our costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant 
affecting each registrant our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources and health and safety 
approximately of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels 
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides  mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are subject to increased regulations  controls and mitigation expenses 
compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment  emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life 
these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and impact financial condition  especially if emission and or discharge limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase 
if we retire generating plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life  there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants 
while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies  replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices  without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 
regulation of co emissions  either through legislation or by the federal epa  could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain 
affecting each registrant the us congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control co emissions since in december  the federal epa issued a final endangerment finding under the caa regarding emissions from motor vehicles 
the federal epa also finalized co emission standards for new motor vehicles  and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of co emissions in a phased manner through several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the federal epa s subsequent rulemakings 
in  the federal epa issued a proposed co emissions standard for new power generation sources with a co limit equivalent to a natural gas unit 
a final rule is expected in the first half of management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major us industrial enterprises  including us and our customers 
if co and other emission standards are imposed  the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older  less efficient  coal fired units 
while we expect that costs of complying with new co and other greenhouse gases emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business  without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 
courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our co emissions 
affecting each registrant in the past there have been several cases  and currently there is one pending case  seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we  among others  are defendants 
in general  the actions allege that co emissions from the defendants power plants constitute a public nuisance due to impacts of global warming and climate change 
the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief 
if the pending or other future actions are resolved against us  substantial modifications of our existing coal fired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce co emissions 
such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers 
this could have a material impact on our costs 
in addition  we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment  accelerate the timing of capital expenditures  pay damages or penalties and or halt operations 
while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis  without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 
moreover  our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 
our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control 
affecting each registrant we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis 
we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity  natural gas  emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations 
with respect to such transactions  the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates  and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend  in large part  upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets 
these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time 
trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline 
in addition  the ferc  which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates  as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets  may impose price limitations  bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets 
power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc 
fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile  and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and or emissions costs 
these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 
volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from weather conditions  including storms 
economic conditions 
outages of major generation or transmission facilities 
seasonality 
power usage 
illiquid markets 
transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies 
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources 
demand for energy commodities 
natural gas  crude oil and refined products and coal production levels 
natural disasters  wars  embargoes and other catastrophic events 
federal  state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation 
our power trading including coal  gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities 
affecting each registrant our power trading including coal  gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements 
we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities 
as a result  we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business  operating results or financial position 
we routinely have open trading positions in the market  within guidelines we set  resulting from the management of our trading portfolio 
to the extent open trading positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 
our power trading and risk management activities  including our power sales agreements with counterparties  rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy related commodities 
these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made 
even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates  results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 
parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations  which could harm our results of operations 
affecting each registrant we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices  which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses 
although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty  our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 
we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control 
if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity  we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power 
affecting each registrant we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale 
this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks 
if transmission is disrupted  or transmission capacity is inadequate  we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power 
if a region s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate  our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited 
if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed  the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 
the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales 
although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas  access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable 
we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 
we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities 
affecting each registrant we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity  natural gas  coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations 
in connection with these trading activities  we routinely enter into financial contracts  including futures and options  over the counter options  financially settled swaps and other derivative contracts 
these activities expose us to risks from price movements 
if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate  it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 
we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie  to hedge our exposure to demand  market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices 
however  we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility 
to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility  our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market 
financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations 
affecting each registrant in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law dodd frank act 
the federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets and significantly alter how over the counter otc derivatives are regulated 
the law increased regulatory oversight of otc energy derivatives  including a imposing pervasive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc on dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps  b requiring certain standardized otc derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges as directed by cftc  c imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements on swap dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps and d increasing the monitoring and compliance obligations of parties who engage in swaps  including new recordkeeping and reporting requirements with governmental entities 
the cftc has issued regulations exempting certain end users of energy commodities from being required to clear otc derivatives  provided that they a are using the swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and b satisfy certain other requirements 
to the extent we meet such requirements  the end user exemption could reduce the effect of the law clearing requirements on our hedging activity 
pursuant to authority granted under the dodd frank act  the cftc has also issued rules that  among other things  further define the otc derivative products and entities subject to additional regulatory oversight  which recently became effective 
these requirements could subject us to additional regulatory oversight related to our otc derivative transactions  cause our otc derivative transactions to be more costly and have an impact on financial condition due to additional capital requirements 
in addition  as these reforms aim to standardize otc products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor otc derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage
