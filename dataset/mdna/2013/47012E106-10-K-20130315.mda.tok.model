item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical collection experience  accounts receivable aging  customer disputes and the collectability of specific customer accounts 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off 
major customers accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis  more in depth reviews are performed based upon changes in a customer s financial condition and or the level of credit being extended 
when a significant event occurs  such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer  and on a quarterly basis  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk prospects 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred product shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
jakks routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives and support customer promotions and we provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise 
such programs are primarily based upon customer purchases  customer performance of specified promotional activities and other specified factors such as sales to consumers 
accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
due to the subjective nature of the impairment analysis  significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect the conclusion regarding the future cash flows necessary to support the valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill 
the valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment 
based upon the assumptions underlying the valuation  impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit s book value 
if the implied fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is not indicated 
if impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill  with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million as of december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
based upon a consideration of quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volume  anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued  slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value 
failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in us under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items 
furthermore  significant changes in demand for our products would impact management s estimates in establishing our inventory provision 
management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded  as an increase to cost of sales  when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard 
income allocation for income taxes 
our annual income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based upon actual income as allocated to the various tax jurisdictions based upon our transfer pricing study  us and foreign statutory income tax rates and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the us and foreign jurisdictions  and in evaluating worldwide uncertain tax positions 
actual results could differ materially from those judgments  and changes from such judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and interest and penalties related to income tax payable 
we do not file a consolidated return for our foreign subsidiaries 
we file federal and state returns and our foreign subsidiaries each file returns in their respective jurisdictions  as applicable 
deferred taxes are provided on a liability method  whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we consider evidence such as our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in previous periods and our forecast of future taxable income 
we believe this to be a critical accounting policy because should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not likely  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have not provided for united states  federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in the period that our intent changes 
we accrue a tax reserve for additional income taxes and interest  which may become payable in future years as a result of audit adjustments by tax authorities 
the reserve is based upon management s assessment of all relevant information and is periodically reviewed and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
as of december   our income tax reserves were approximately million and relate to the potential income tax audit adjustments  primarily in the areas of income allocation  foreign depreciation allowances and state taxes 
we recognize current period interest expense and the reversal of previously recognized interest expense that has been determined to not be assessable due to the expiration of the related audit period or other compelling factors on the income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense  and penalties and penalty reversals related to the income taxes payable as other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
share based compensation 
we grant restricted stock and options to purchase our common stock to our employees including officers and non employee directors under our stock award and incentive plan the plan  which incorporated the shares remaining under our third amended and restated stock option plan 
the benefits provided under the plan are share based payments 
related to the stock option grants  we estimate the value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  cancellations  terminations  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
related to the restricted stock award grants  we determine the value of each award based on the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of each grant and expense each award over the stipulated service period

quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are payable in full upon maturity of the credit facility on april  the credit facility is secured by a substantial amount of our assets 
the amount outstanding on the credit facility at december  was million  the total borrowing capacity was approximately million based on applicable advance rates applied to our accounts receivable and inventory 
our ability to borrow under the loan agreement is subject to our ongoing compliance with certain financial covenants  including that we a maintain and earn on a consolidated basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  for the rolling four quarter period ending on such date  consolidated net profit as defined in the loan agreement equal to or greater than one dollar  b maintain a ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda the consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than i on september   ii on december  and thereafter  and c maintain liquidity as defined in the loan agreement of at least million 
the loan agreement allows us to borrow under the credit facility at libor or at a base rate  plus applicable margins based upon the funded debt to ebitda leverage ratio for the most recent twelve month rolling quarter end 
applicable margins vary between a to basis point spread over libor and between a negative to zero basis point spread on base rate loans 
as of december   the rate on the credit facility was 
in addition  the credit facility has an unused line fee  ranging from to basis points based upon the unused amount of the credit facility 
the loan agreement also contains customary events of default  including a cross default provision and a change of control provision 
in the event of a default  all obligations under the loan agreement may be declared immediately due and payable 
for certain events of default relating to insolvency and receivership  all outstanding obligations become due and payable 
as of december   we were not in compliance with two of the three financial covenants under the loan agreement  but were in compliance with all of the remaining covenants 
at december   we had consolidated net profit of negative million  a consolidated leverage ratio of and liquidity of million 
we were required to obtain waivers from our lender to avoid breaches of financial covenants for the period ending december  based upon current internal financial forecasts for the first quarter of  we may not comply with the consolidated net profit covenant required under the loan agreement for the period ending march  accordingly  as a result of the failure to meet any of these financial covenants or any other covenants under the loan agreement  the lender may declare an event of default  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we would be required to obtain amendments and or waivers or renegotiate the loan agreement with our lender  however  there is no assurance that the lender will grant any waiver or agree to an amendment or renegotiation of the loan agreement 
any such amendment or waiver will likely require payment of a fee  result in higher interest rates on outstanding loan amounts and or impose other restrictions 
if the lender does not agree to a waiver and or amendment and determines that an event of default has occurred  the lender may accelerate all obligations under the loan agreement  demand immediate repayment of all obligations and or terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the loan agreement 
if access to our credit facility is limited or terminated  liquidity would be constrained  affecting our operations and growth prospects and requiring that we seek additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance that such alternative financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
furthermore  any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants that could impede our ability to effectively operate and grow our business in the future 
in november  we sold an aggregate of million of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company  will pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum and will mature on november  the initial conversion rate was shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
as a result of the cash dividend of per share declared by the board of directors and paid on october   january   april   july   october  and january  the new conversion rate will be shares of jakks common stock per  principal amount of notes or approximately per share 
prior to august   holders of the notes may convert their notes only upon specified events 
upon conversion  the notes may be settled  at our election  in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or some of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the notes 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million in although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we intend to finance our long term liquidity requirements out of net cash provided by operations and net cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
we have cumulative undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries that we consider to be permanently reinvested outside the us should those earnings be repatriated to the us  we would incur additional tax expense 
other than for short term financing needs of our us parent company  we do not intend to repatriate those earnings to the us the amount of cash and short term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the last three fiscal years ending december   we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations 
exchange rates sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either us or hong kong dollars 
operations and operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our operating results 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  should such events occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
to date  we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk in november  we issued convertible senior notes payable of million with a fixed interest rate of per annum which remain outstanding as of december  accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss related to these notes arising from changes in interest rates 
our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our revolving credit facility  see note credit facility in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on prime lending rate or libor rate at the option of the company 
for prime lending rate loans  the interest rate is equal to the highest of i the daily weighted average federal funds rate on overnight transactions plus  ii wells fargo s prime rate and iii a one month libor rate plus  in each case there is an additional margin ranging from negative to nil based on certain conditions 
for libor rate loans  the interest rate is equal to a libor rate plus a margin ranging from to based on certain conditions 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are therefore subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates 
interest rate risk may result from many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
at december   the maximum amount borrowed under the credit facility was million and the average amount of borrowings outstanding was million 
if the prevailing market interest rates relative to these borrowing increased by  our interest expense during the period ended december  would have increased by less than million 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong  china  the united kingdom  france  spain  france and canada 
sales are generally made by these operations on fob china or hong kong terms and are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars and local operating expenses in china are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the chinese yuan or hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
our mainland china operations are funded in chinese yuan 
we do not believe that near term changes in these exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar or chinese yuan
