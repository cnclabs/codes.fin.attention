item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide the readers of our financial statements with a narrative discussion about our business 
the md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we are reporting a  increase in net sales and a  increase in operating income for fiscal from fiscal our net income increased to  or per diluted share  an increase of  or compared to fiscal year our financial position as of june   remains strong  as we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  working capital of  and shareholders equity of  our business is separated into three principal segments human health  pharmaceutical ingredients and performance chemicals 
products that fall within the human health segment include finished dosage form generic drugs and nutraceutical products 
in december  we acquired certain assets of rising pharmaceuticals  inc rising  a new jersey based company that markets and distributes generic prescription and over the counter pharmaceutical products to leading wholesalers  chain drug stores  distributors  mass market merchandisers and others under its own label  throughout the united states 
this is a natural extension of our successful business model which provides customers and suppliers additional opportunities to penetrate the end user segment of the pharmaceutical market 
with the rising brand label  we have been able to expand our direct involvement in the pharmaceutical space through greater global awareness of our capabilities in the marketing of pharmaceutical intermediates  active ingredients and the ultimate end products  finished dosage form generics 
aceto supplies the raw materials used in the production of nutritional and packaged dietary supplements  including vitamins  amino acids  iron compounds and biochemicals used in pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations 
after we identified a change in the attitudes of europeans towards nutritional products  we globalized this business  creating an operating company headquartered in germany  aceto health ingredients gmbh 
this globally structured business then became the model for all of our business segments  providing international reach and perspective for our customers 
the pharmaceutical ingredients segment has two product groups active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and pharmaceutical intermediates 
as the use of generic drugs has grown significantly over the years  we believe aceto s presence in this market also increased  both domestically and internationally 
we supply apis to many of the major generic drug companies  who we believe view aceto as a valued partner in their effort to develop and market generic drugs 
the process of introducing a new api from pipeline to market spans a number of years and begins with aceto partnering with a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer and jointly selecting an api  several years before the expiration of a composition of matter patent  for future generisizing 
we then identify the appropriate supplier  and concurrently utilizing our global technical network  ensure they meet the highest standards of quality to comply with regulations 
the generic pharmaceutical company will submit the abbreviated new drug application anda for us food and drug administration fda approval or european equivalent approval 
the introduction of the api to market occurs after all the development testing has been completed and the anda or european equivalent is approved and the patent expires or is deemed invalid 
aceto has a robust pipeline of apis poised to reach commercial levels  both in the united states and europe 
aceto has long been a supplier of pharmaceutical intermediates  the complex chemical compounds that are the building blocks used in producing apis 
these are the critical components of all drugs  whether they are already on the market or currently undergoing clinical trials 
faced with significant economic pressures as well as ever increasing regulatory barriers  the innovative drug companies look to aceto as a source for high quality intermediates 
utilizing our global sourcing  regulatory support and quality assurance network  aceto works with the large  global pharmaceutical companies  sourcing lower cost  quality pharmaceutical intermediates that will meet the same high level standards adhered to by their current commercial products 
the performance chemicals segment includes specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products 
aceto is a major supplier to many different industrial segments that require outstanding performance from chemical raw materials and additives 
we provide chemicals which make plastics  surface coatings  textiles  fuels and lubricants to perform to their designed capabilities 
these additive specialty products include antioxidants  photo initiators  catalysts  curatives  brighteners and adhesion promoters 
aceto is at the forefront as a supplier of chemicals to ecofriendly technologies 
for example  we supply ultraviolet photo initiators which allow inks and coatings to be cured by ultraviolet light instead of solvents  as well as curing agents and optical brighteners for powder non solvent coatings 
these growing technologies are critical in protecting and enhancing the world s ecology 
we provide specialty chemicals for the food  beverage and fragrance industries 
aceto s raw materials are also used in sophisticated technology products  such as high end electronic parts circuit boards and computer chips and binders for specialized rocket fuels 
aceto is also a leader in the supply of diazos and couplers to the paper and film industries 
specific end uses for these products include microfilm  blueprints and photo tooling of printed circuit boards 
we also provide organic intermediates and colorants 
the color producing industry manufactures a wide assortment of products and aceto is the supplier of choice to these producers of color 
from textiles and plastics to inks and paints  our specialty colorant intermediates allow manufacturers to develop an endless rainbow of colorful possibilities 
aceto s agricultural protection products include herbicides  fungicides and insecticides which control weed growth as well as the spread of insects and microorganisms that can severely damage plant growth 
the agricultural world is dependent on a large variety of deterrent products and we believe aceto has become a valued partner to the global generic agricultural industry by providing superior quality functional products 
one of aceto s most widely used agricultural protection products is a sprout inhibitor that extends the storage life of potatoes 
we work with the large agrochemical distributors to provide alternate sources for key products 
utilizing our global sourcing and regulatory capabilities  we identify and qualify manufacturers either producing the product or with knowledge of the chemistry necessary to produce the product and then file an application with the epa for a product registration 
aceto has an ongoing working relationship with manufacturers in china and india to determine which of the non patented  or generic  agricultural protection products they produce can be effectively marketed in the western world 
we believe the company s main business strengths are sourcing  regulatory support  quality assurance and marketing and distribution 
we distribute more than  chemical compounds used principally as finished products or raw materials in the pharmaceutical  nutraceutical  agricultural  coatings and industrial chemical industries 
with business operations in nine countries  aceto s global reach is distinctive in the industry  enabling us to source and supply quality products on a worldwide basis 
leveraging local professionals  we source more than two thirds of our products from asia  buying from approximately companies in china and in india 
in this md a  we explain our general financial condition and results of operations  including  among other things  the following factors that affect our business our earnings and costs in the periods presented changes in earnings and costs between periods sources of earnings the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition as you read this md a  refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for the three years ended june  we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts  partnered products  inventories  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  long lived assets  environmental and other contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on various factors  including historical experience  advice from outside subject matter experts  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affected our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of any product when it is shipped and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we have no acceptance or other post shipment obligations and we do not offer product warranties or services to our customers 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of damaged goods from customers  which historically have been immaterial  and sales incentives offered to customers 
sales incentives include volume incentive rebates 
we record volume incentive rebates based on the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer in earning the rebate 
in addition  upon each sale  estimates of rebates  chargebacks  returns  government reimbursed rebates  and other adjustments are made 
these estimates are recorded as reductions to gross revenues  with corresponding adjustments to either liabilities or reserve for price concessions 
we have the experience and access to relevant information that we believe are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust our reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from customers being unable to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and the industries in which those customers operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their ability to make payments being impaired  additional allowances would be required 
royalty income we have royalty agreements on certain products where third party pharmaceutical and agricultural protection companies market such products 
we earn and collect royalty income based on percentages of net profits as defined in those agreements 
royalty income is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
partnered products we have various products which we have entered into collaborative arrangements with certain pharmaceutical companies 
as a result of these arrangements  we share profits on sales of these products  which are included in cost of sales 
the shared profits are settled on a quarterly basis 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
we write down our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete goods by an amount equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  we may overestimate or underestimate the demand for our products which would result in our understating or overstating  respectively  the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other indefinite lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
in accordance with gaap  we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  we use many assumptions and estimates that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  we use industry accepted valuation models and appropriate market participant assumptions that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
if our estimates or our related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
long lived assets in accordance with gaap  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets principally consist of customer relationships  product rights and related intangibles  epa registrations and related data  patent license  and technology based intangibles 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
environmental and other contingencies we establish accrued liabilities for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual  or our share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period that the determination was made 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with gaap 
gaap establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we had current net deferred tax assets of and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on our projecting that we will have sufficient future earnings to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize a deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset could result in a reduction of net income at that time 
deferred taxes have not been provided for on the majority of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since substantially all of these earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
a deferred tax liability is recognized when we expect that we will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
the company intends to permanently reinvest any undistributed earnings and has no plan for further repatriation 
determination of the amount of the unrecognized us income tax liability on undistributed earnings is not practical because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
in addition  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce a portion of such us tax liability 
stock based compensation in accordance with gaap  we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  including an estimate of forfeiture rates 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life and dividend yield 
the company uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is a combination of both historical volatility  calculated based on the daily closing prices of its common stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and implied volatility  utilizing market data of actively traded options on aceto s common stock  which are obtained from public data sources 
the company believes that the historical volatility of the price of its common stock over the expected life of the option is a reasonable indicator of the expected future volatility and that implied volatility takes into consideration market expectations of how future volatility might differ from historical volatility 
accordingly  the company believes a combination of both historical and implied volatility provides the best estimate of the future volatility of the market price of its common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the company uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales by segment year ended june  comparison over under of of segment net sales total net sales total change change human health pharmaceutical ingredients performance chemicals net sales gross profit by segment year ended june  comparison over under gross of gross of segment profit sales profit sales change change human health pharmaceutical ingredients performance chemicals gross profit net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales increases in all three of our business segments 
human health net sales for the human health segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year  largely driven by an increase in sales of rising products of  due to new generic product launches at rising 
this increase is partially offset by a reduction in domestic sales of  of nutritional products due to lower orders of existing products 
pharmaceutical ingredients net sales for the pharmaceutical ingredients segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year 
overall  the domestic pharmaceutical ingredients group had an increase of  when compared to the prior period 
the primary reason for the increase is due to the volume of large reorders for existing apis sold by our united states and german operations  as well as a launch of a new product  sold domestically 
in addition  sales of intermediates  which represent key components used in the manufacture of certain drug products  have risen both in the united states and abroad by approximately  over the prior year 
performance chemicals net sales for the performance chemicals segment increased to  for the year ended june   an increase of  or  from net sales of  for the prior year 
our performance chemicals segment experienced an increase in sales of our agricultural protection products  primarily from sales of a wide range insecticide used on various crops including cereals  citrus  cotton  grapes  ornamental grasses and vegetables and increased sales of a broad spectrum herbicide 
these increases in agricultural protection product sales are partially offset by a decline in domestic sales of agricultural intermediates  sold by our specialty chemicals business 
gross profit gross profit increased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
human health human health s gross profit of  for the year ended june  increased  or  over the prior year 
the gross margin increased to for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit and gross margin in the human health segment primarily relates to increased sales volume of rising products 
pharmaceutical ingredients gross profit for the year ended june  for the pharmaceutical ingredients business increased by  or over the prior year 
the gross margin of was also higher than the prior year s gross margin of 
the increase in both gross profit and gross margin is predominantly the result of the increase in the sales volume of reorders of certain api s  which typically yield a significantly higher gross margin 
performance chemicals gross profit for the performance chemicals segment increased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
the gross margin at for the year ended june  was relatively flat compared to the prior year s gross margin of 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a remained constant at for the year ended june  versus the prior year 
the primary reasons for the increase in sg a are  additional accrued contingent consideration related to the rising acquisition as well as increased research and development expenses related to certain rising products and increased information technology maintenance and software related costs 
we also experienced additional accrued performance award expense and increased fringe benefits and stock based compensation expense due to increased financial performance 
during fiscal  the company recorded approximately of one time costs associated with the separation of certain executive management employees  as well as additional accrued contingent consideration related to the rising acquisition 
operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the overall increase in gross profit of  partially offset by an increase in sg a of  from the prior year 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended june   a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to lower average loan balance outstanding during the fiscal year ended june  versus june   as well as a lower adjusted libor rate during the period 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due to the mix of profits from higher tax rate jurisdictions in fiscal in addition  in fiscal we repatriated earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries  in connection with our acquisition of rising 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the reversal of approximately of tax expense related to the final tax payment associated with the fiscal repatriation 
the company intends to permanently reinvest its undistributed earnings and has no plan for further repatriation

we reported sales increases in our human health and pharmaceutical ingredients business segments and a decrease in our performance chemicals segment 
human health net sales for the human health segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year due to  increase in sales of rising products  where there was only six months of sales in the prior year  due to the acquisition of this subsidiary in december this increase in human health sales also relates to an increase in sales of domestic nutritional supplements of  due to new business development from existing customers and new projects from our pipeline 
pharmaceutical ingredients net sales for the pharmaceutical ingredients segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year 
overall  the domestic pharmaceutical ingredient group had an increase of  when compared to the prior period 
this increase in domestic pharmaceutical ingredients sales is primarily related to an increase in sales of apis due to the reorders of existing products 
in addition  the pharmaceutical ingredients segment saw an increase in sales from our international operations of  over the prior year  particularly increases in sales of apis and pharmaceutical intermediates sold abroad  which represent key components used in the manufacture of certain drug products 
performance chemicals net sales for the performance chemicals segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year  representing a  or decrease 
sales of our domestic specialty chemicals increased  over the prior year  due primarily to a rise in sales of agricultural intermediates 
our specialty chemicals business consists of a variety of products  customers and consuming markets  most of which is affected by current economic conditions 
as previously mentioned  the index for consumer durables  which impacts the specialty chemicals business grew at an annual rate of 
this increase is offset by a decline of  in sales of specialty chemicals sold abroad  as well as a decline in agricultural protection products sales of  primarily due to glyphosate 
our entry into this market had proven to be much more challenging than had been expected 
as previously indicated  our future participation in the glyphosate market will likely only be on an opportunistic basis when our customers and asian sourcing offers us an opportunity to be profitable and competitive in the us domestic market 
the decrease in agricultural protection products sales is offset in part by an increase in a wide range insecticide that is used on various crops including cereals  citrus  cotton  grapes  ornamental grasses and vegetables 
gross profit gross profit increased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
human health human health s gross profit of  for the year ended june  increased  or  over the prior year 
the gross margin increased to for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit and gross margin in the human health segment primarily relates to rising  certain assets of which we acquired on december  in addition  increase in gross margin was related to a rise in gross margin on our nutraceutical products due to product mix and increased prices in china on nutritional supplements which we were successful in passing through to our customers 
pharmaceutical ingredients gross profit for the year ended june  for the pharmaceutical ingredients business increased by  or over the prior year 
gross margin of was relatively consistent to gross margin of for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit is due to increased sales volume of our domestic products 
performance chemicals gross profit for the year ended june  increased by  or  over the prior year 
gross margin was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross margin is attributable to our previous discussion on glyphosate  of which gross margin in the prior year was lower than expected due to the difficult and crowded market conditions surrounding this commodity type product 
we also incurred decreased amortization expense related to product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for the year ended june  versus for the prior year 
on december   we acquired certain assets of rising  thus we now have a full year of sg a for this subsidiary  including amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets  compared to six months in the prior year 
in addition  we recorded during fiscal approximately of one time costs associated with the separation of certain executive management employees  as well as additional accrued contingent consideration related to the rising acquisition 
we experienced additional accrued performance award expense and increased fringe benefits and stock based compensation expense due to increased financial performance 
these increases in sg a are offset in part by  of transaction costs related to the rising acquisition  which was recorded in fiscal operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the overall increase in gross profit of  partially offset by an increase in sg a of  from the prior year 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended june   an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to interest expense on the bank loans that were incurred to partially finance the acquisition of certain assets of rising 
in the prior year  we had six months of interest expense related to this financing versus a full year in fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an approximate  tax charge recorded in fiscal related to the repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries  in connection with our acquisition of rising 
the company intends to permanently reinvest its undistributed earnings and has no plan for further repatriation 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the reversal of approximately of tax expense related to the final tax payment associated with the fiscal repatriation 
without these adjustments  the effective tax rate would be and  respectively  in fiscal years and liquidity and capital resources cash flows at june   we had  in cash  of which  was outside the united states   in short term investments  all of which is held outside the united states and  in long term debt including the current portion  all of which is in the united states 
working capital was  at june  versus  at june  the  of cash held outside of the united states is fully accessible to meet any liquidity needs of the countries in which aceto operates 
the majority of the cash located outside of the united states is held by our european operations and can be transferred into the united states 
although these amounts are fully accessible  transferring these amounts into the united states or any other countries could have certain tax consequences 
a deferred tax liability will be recognized when we expect that we will recover undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
the company intends to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings and has no plan for further repatriation 
a portion of our cash is held in operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
our cash position at june  increased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  as compared to cash provided of  for the comparable period 
the  was comprised of  in net income   derived from adjustments for non cash items and a net  decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities

trade accounts receivable increased  during the year ended june  due predominantly to an increase in sales in this fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as an increase in days sales outstanding  from june  other receivables increased  due to royalties related to nutritional products as well as an increase in value added taxes receivables in our german subsidiaries 
accounts payable decreased by  due to timing of payments processed at the end of the quarter related to the sales volume increase 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased  due primarily to an increase in price concessions and partnered products liabilities related to increased sales from rising  as well as an increase in accrued compensation related to increased accrued performance awards  which are anticipated to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal  and a rise in income tax payables related to the increased profitability

the non cash items included  in depreciation and amortization expense   of earnings on an equity investment in a joint venture and  in non cash stock compensation expense 
trade accounts receivable decreased  during the year ended june  due to an improvement in days sales outstanding 
inventories increased by approximately  due primarily to an increase in inventories on hand for rising as this subsidiary had launched several new products and as such  had built up stock for fiscal sales 
in addition  our netherlands subsidiary as well as our german subsidiaries for both nutritional and pharmaceutical ingredients  had increased inventory on hand due to anticipated first quarter sales 
this rise in inventories was also due to purchases of domestic specialty chemicals  as a result of a ramp up in orders for products that were shipped in fiscal other receivables decreased  due to payments received on royalties related to agricultural protection products as well as a decrease in value added taxes receivables in our german subsidiaries 
accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased  due to a decline in advance payments from customers 
our cash position at june  decreased  from the amount at june  operating activities for the year ended june  provided cash of  as compared to a use of cash of  for the comparable period

at june   the company had available lines of credit with foreign financial institutions totaling  all of which is available for borrowing by the respective foreign territories 
we are not subject to any financial covenants under these arrangements 
on december   the company entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with two us financial institutions 
aceto may borrow  repay and reborrow during the period ending december   up to but not exceeding at any one time outstanding  the revolving loans 
the revolving loans may be i adjusted libor loans as defined in the credit agreement  ii alternate base rate loans as defined in the credit agreement or iii a combination thereof

the company borrowed a term loan of  on december  the term loan interest may be payable as an i adjusted libor loan  ii alternate base rate loan  or iii a combination thereof 
as of june   the remaining amount outstanding under the original amortizing term loan is  and is payable as an adjusted libor loan at an interest rate of at june  the credit agreement also provides that commercial letters of credit shall be issued to provide the primary payment mechanism in connection with the purchase of any materials  goods or services by us in the ordinary course of business 
at june   we had utilized  in bank loans and letters of credit  leaving  of this facility unused 
the terms of these letters of credit are all less than one year 
no material loss is anticipated due to non performance by the counterparties to these agreements 
the credit agreement provides for a security interest in all of our personal property 
the credit agreement contains several financial covenants including  among other things  maintaining a minimum level of debt service 
we are also subject to certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  covenants governing liens  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on cash dividends  guarantees  sale of assets  sales of receivables  and loans and investments 
we were in compliance with all covenants at june  pursuant to the requirements of the credit agreement  we are required to deliver hedging agreements as defined in the credit agreement fixing the interest rate on not less than  of the term loan 
accordingly  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of  which has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the expiration date of this interest rate swap is december  working capital outlook working capital was  at june   versus  at june  in march  we purchased a building in port washington  new york  which is now the site of our global headquarters 
we moved our corporate offices into this new building in april on june   we entered into a mortgage payable for  on this new corporate headquarters 
this mortgage payable is secured by the land and building and is being amortized over a period of years 
the mortgage payable bears interest at and matures on june  we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses that are complementary to our own  and such transactions may require the use of cash 
in connection with our agricultural protection business  we plan to continue to acquire product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups  which could approximate  over the next fiscal year 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  as amended  related to the rising acquisition   of deferred consideration was to be paid by aceto over a four year period with  paid in february   paid in december   to be paid not later than fifty six days following the third anniversary of the closing date of the purchase and  to be paid not later than fifty six days following the fourth anniversary of the closing date of the purchase

interest is not included in the above table as the majority of the debt is variable in nature 
as of june   interest on these variable loans was 
other significant commitments and contingencies include the following a subsidiary of the company markets certain agricultural protection products which are subject to the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
fifra requires that test data be provided to the epa to register  obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products 
the epa requires that follow on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the fifra regulations 
follow on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data 
however  when fifra requirements mandate that new test data be generated to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product  often both the initial and follow on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort 
the company is presently a member of several such task force groups  which requires payments for such memberships 
in addition  in connection with our agricultural protection business  the company plans to acquire product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency to support such registrations and other supporting data for several products 
the acquisition of these product registrations and related data filed with the united states environmental protection agency as well as payments to various task force groups could approximate  through fiscal  of which and has been accrued as of june  and june  we  together with our subsidiaries  are subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business 
we do not know how the final resolution of these matters will affect our results of operations in a particular reporting period

the company has environmental remediation obligations in connection with arsynco  inc arsynco  a subsidiary formerly involved in manufacturing chemicals located in carlstadt  new jersey  which was closed in and is currently held for sale 
based on continued monitoring of the contamination at the site and the approved plan of remediation  the company received an estimate from an environmental consultant stating that the costs of remediation could be between  and  remediation commenced in fiscal  and as of june  and june   a liability of  and  respectively  is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for this matter 
in accordance with gaap  management believes that the majority of costs incurred to remediate the site will be capitalized in preparing the property which is currently classified as held for sale 
an appraisal of the fair value of the property by a third party appraiser supports the assumption that the expected fair value after the remediation is in excess of the amount required to be capitalized 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from those assumed in current estimates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
in connection with the environmental remediation obligation for arsynco  in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement with basf corporation basf  the former owners of the arsynco property

accordingly  the company had recorded a gain of in fiscal this gain relates to the partial reimbursement of costs of approximately  that the company had previously expensed 
the company also recorded an additional receivable from basf  with an offset against property held for sale  representing its estimated portion of the future remediation costs 
the balance of this receivable for future remediation costs as of june  and june  is  and  respectively  which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in march  arsynco received notice from the epa of its status as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla for a site described as the berry s creek study area 
arsynco is one of over prps which have potential liability for the required investigation and remediation of the site 
the estimate of the potential liability is not quantifiable for a number of reasons  including the difficulty in determining the extent of contamination and the length of time remediation may require 
in addition  any estimate of liability must also consider the number of other prps and their financial strength 
based on prior practice in similar situations  it is possible that the state may assert a claim for natural resource damages with respect to the arsynco site itself  and either the federal government or the state or both may assert claims against arsynco for natural resource damages in connection with berry s creek  any such claim with respect to berry s creek could also be asserted against the approximately prps which the epa has identified in connection with that site 
any claim for natural resource damages with respect to the arsynco site itself may also be asserted against basf  the former owners of the arsynco property 
in september  arsynco entered into an agreement with three of the other prps that had previously been impleaded into new jersey department of environmental protection  et al 
v 
occidental chemical corporation  et al  docket no

arsynco entered into agreement to avoid impleader 
pursuant to agreement  arsynco agreed to a tolling period that would not be included when computing the running of any statute of limitations that might provide a defense to the njdep litigation  the waiver of certain issue preclusion defenses in the njdep litigation  and arbitration of certain potential future liability allocation claims if the other parties to the agreement are barred by a court of competent jurisdiction from proceeding against arsynco 
since an amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated at this time  no accrual is recorded for these potential future costs 
the impact of the resolution of this matter on the company s results of operations in a particular reporting period is not known

although the company acknowledges that it shipped materials to the site for formulation over twenty years ago  the company believes that the evidence does not show that the hazardous materials sent by aceto to the site have significantly contributed to the contamination of the environment and thus believes that  at most  it is a de minimus contributor to the site contamination

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in investment market prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
investment market price risk we had short term investments of  at june  those short term investments consisted of time deposits 
time deposits are short term in nature and are accordingly valued at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we hedge some of our transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding that had a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june   was not material 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  with the most significant being the euro 
the potential loss as of june   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect our results of operations 
pursuant to the requirements of the credit agreement  the company is required to deliver hedging agreements as defined in the credit agreement fixing the interest rate on not less than  of the term loan 
accordingly  in march  the company entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of  which has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the expiration date of this interest rate swap is december  the unrealized loss to date associated with this derivative  which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at june   is aceto s interest rate swap is classified within level as the fair value of this hedge is primarily based on observable interest rates
