item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation primarily focused on investing in  financing and managing residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans 
we are externally managed and advised by invesco advisers  inc  our manager  which is an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of invesco ltd 
we elected to qualify to be taxed as a reit commencing with our taxable year ended december  accordingly  we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our shareholders as long as we maintain our qualification as a reit 
we operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exclusion from the definition of investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
to achieve this objective  we primarily invest in the following agency rmbs  which are residential mortgage backed securities  for which a us government agency such as the government national mortgage association ginnie mae or a federally chartered corporation such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities  non agency rmbs  which are rmbs that are not issued or guaranteed by a us government agency or a federally chartered corporation  cmbs  which are commercial mortgage backed securities  and residential and commercial mortgage loans 
we finance the majority of our investments in agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs through short term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements 
we have also financed our investments in certain non agency rmbs  cmbs and residential and commercial mortgage loans by contributing capital to the invesco imrf fund that received financing under the us government s pipp  established and managed by our manager or one of its affiliates  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 

table of contents public offerings on july   we completed a public offering of an initial issuance of million shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  or the series a preferred stock  at the price of per share 
on august   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option in part to purchase an additional  shares of the series a preferred stock  at the price of per share 
total proceeds were million  net of issuance costs of million 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock at an average price of under the share repurchase feature of our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan drspp with total proceeds of million  net of issuance costs of  factors impacting our operating results our operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of  and demand for  the target assets in which we invest 
our net interest income  which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds  as measured by the constant prepayment rate cpr on our target assets 
interest rates and prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
market conditions beginning in the summer of  significant adverse changes in financial market conditions resulted in a deleveraging of the entire global financial system 
as part of this process  residential and commercial mortgage markets in the united states experienced a variety of difficulties  including loan defaults  credit losses and reduced liquidity 
as a result  many lenders tightened their lending standards  reduced lending capacity  liquidated significant portfolios or exited the market altogether  and therefore  financing with attractive terms was generally unavailable 
in response to these unprecedented events  the us government has taken a number of actions to stabilize the financial markets and encourage lending 
significant measures include the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of to  among other things  establish the troubled asset relief program tarp  the enactment of the housing and economic recovery act of hera  which established a new regulator for fannie mae and freddie mac and the establishment of the term asset backed securities loan facility talf and the ppip 
some of these programs have expired and the impact of the wind down of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown 
continuing volatility in the rmbs markets may have an adverse effect on the market value and performance of the rmbs in which we invest 
moreover  we rely on financing to acquire  on a leveraged basis  the target assets in which we invest 
if market conditions deteriorate  our lenders may exit the repurchase market  further tighten lending standards  or increase the amount of equity capital required to obtain financing making it more difficult and costly for us to obtain financing 
the dodd frank act enacted in july  contains numerous provisions affecting the financial and mortgage industries  many of which may have an impact on our operating environment and the target assets in which we invest 
consequently  the dodd frank act may affect our cost of doing business  may limit our investment opportunities and may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas 
operation twist  was a program conducted by the us federal reserve in and pursuant to the first operation twist  instituted between september and june  the federal reserve purchased billion of us treasury securities with remaining maturities between and years and sold an equal amount of us treasury securities with remaining maturities of years or less 
from july through december  the federal reserve deployed billion to purchase treasury securities with remaining maturities of years to years and sold or redeemed an equal amount of treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately years or less 
while it is difficult to identify the specific impact operation twist had on our business  the program generally reduced asset values and lowered the interest income we received 
in december  the federal reserve announced that it would replace operation twist with another round of long term asset purchases  or quantitative easing  pursuant to which the federal reserve will continue to purchase billion of agency mbs as well as billion of longer term treasury securities per month 
we expect that during these large scale purchases of agency mbs  yields on agency mbs values will be lower and refinancing volumes will be higher 
as a result  returns on our agency mbs may be adversely affected 

table of contents the federal housing finance agency fhfa and the department of the treasury introduced the home affordable refinance program harp in early harp provides borrowers  who may not otherwise qualify for refinancing because of declining home values or reduced access to mortgage insurance  the ability to refinance their mortgages into a lower interest rate and or more stable mortgage product 
on october   the fhfa announced a series of changes to the rules regarding the harp with the intent of increasing the number of borrowers eligible to refinance their mortgage under this program 
the fhfa announced changes to the guidelines related to loan to value  appraisals  and certain fees  among other things  subject to a variety of qualifications and the extension of the end date for the harp until december  it does not change the time period which these loans were originated  maintaining the requirement that the loans must have been guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac on or before may  we do not expect the current harp or future modifications to have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
on january   the us federal reserve announced that it would keep the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to percent as long as the unemployment rate remains above or until inflation reaches 
low levels of federal funds rates may reduce our borrowing costs 
however  there can be no assurance that federal funds rates will remain near zero percent  or that such low levels will reduce our cost of funds 
investment activities as of december   of our equity was invested in agency rmbs  in non agency rmbs  in cmbs  and in other investments 
we use leverage on our target assets to achieve our return objectives 
for our total investment portfolio  we focus on securities we believe provide attractive returns when levered approximately to times 
the leverage on classes of assets may periodically exceed the stated ranges as we adjust our borrowings to obtain the best available source and minimize total interest expense  while maintaining our overall portfolio leverage guidelines 
the change in equity allocations between our classes of assets reflects our views on the current risk return opportunities in the market for our target assets 
as of december   we had billion billion in year fixed rate agency rmbs securities that offered higher coupons and call protection based on the collateral attributes 
in addition  we held billion billion in year fixed rate agency rmbs securities  million billion in hybrid adjustable rate mortgages agency rmbs arms and million million in agency arm rmbs we believe to have similar durations based on prepayment speeds 
as of december   we held billion billion non agency rmbs 
as of december   we owned billion billion in cmbs and financed billion million in repurchase agreements 
in addition  as of december   we held million million in cmos 
during the twelve months ended december   we purchased billion billion of mortgage backed securities 
the average yield on these purchases as of december  is 
table of contents portfolio characteristics the table below represents the vintage of our credit assets as of december  total re remic senior prime alt a subprime total non agency cmbs for re remic seniors  the table reflects the year in which the resecuritizations were issued 
the vintage distribution of the securities that collateralize the company s re remic senior investments is  and additionally  of our re remic holdings are not senior classes 
the tables below represent the geographic concentration of the underlying collateral for our mbs portfolio as of december  non agency rmbs state percentage cmbs state percentage california california florida new york new york texas virginia florida new jersey illinois maryland pennsylvania washington virginia arizona new jersey colorado ohio illinois massachusetts other other the vintage and geographic concentrations have not significantly changed since december  financing and other liabilities 
we enter into repurchase agreements to finance the majority of our agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs 
these agreements are secured by our agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs and bear interest at rates that have historically moved in close relationship to the london interbank offer rate libor 
as of december   we had entered into repurchase agreements totalling billion billion 
the increase in the amount of the repurchase agreement balance was due to leveraging additional equity received during the year 
we also committed to invest up to million in the invesco mortgage recovery feeder fund lp managed by the company s manager invesco imrf fund and invesco mortgage recovery loans aiv  lp aiv  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
as of december   million million of our commitment to the invesco imrf fund and aiv fund has been called and we are committed to fund million in additional capital 
the company records the liability for mortgage backed securities purchased for which settlement has not taken place as an investment related payable 
as of december  and  the company had investment related payables of million and million  respectively  of which no items were outstanding greater than thirty days 
the change in balance was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage backed security purchases at the quarter ended december  
table of contents hedging instruments 
we generally hedge as much of our interest rate risk as we deem prudent in light of market conditions 
no assurance can be given that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our investment policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that we are required to hedge 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
downward adjustments or mark to market losses would reduce our shareholders equity 
as of december   we have entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to mitigate the effects of increases in interest rates under a portion of our repurchase agreements 
these swap agreements provide for fixed interest rates indexed off of one month libor and effectively fix the floating interest rates on billion billion of borrowings under our repurchase agreements 
as of december   included in this amount we had forward starting swaps with a total notional amount of billion  with starting dates ranging from may  to september  the increase in the amount of interest rate swaps was due to our view of interest rate risk and increases in our borrowing 
we intend to continue to add interest rate hedge positions according to our hedging strategy 
book value per share our book value per common share was  and as of december     respectively  on a fully diluted basis  after giving effect to our units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership  which may be converted to common shares at the sole election of the company 
the change in our book value was primarily due to the change in valuation of our investment portfolio and our interest rate hedges that are recorded in other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet

the value of our assets and liabilities change daily based on market conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s for interest rate risk and its impact on fair value 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties 
our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported assets and liabilities  as well as our reported revenues and expenses 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are based are reasonable at the time made and based upon information available to us at that time 
we rely upon independent pricing of our assets at each quarter s end to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates of fair market value 
for a discussion of our critical accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial statements in the financial statements accompanying this report 

table of contents expected impact of new authoritative guidance on future financial information in december  the fasb issued accounting standards updated  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
asu amends topic to require additional disclosure information about offsetting and related arrangements 
entities will be required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transaction subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements 
the objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on a basis of us gaap and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
we do not believe that the adoption of the amended guidance will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents the cpr of our portfolio impacts the amount of premium and discount on the purchase of securities that is recognized into income 
our agency and non agency rmbs had a weighted average cpr of and for the three months ended december  and september   respectively 
the table below shows the three month cpr for our rmbs compared to bonds with similar characteristics cohorts december  september  company cohort company cohort year agency rmbs year agency rmbs agency hybrid arm rmbs na na non agency rmbs na na overall na na interest expense and the cost of funds our largest expense is the interest expense on borrowed funds 
for  we had average borrowed funds of billion billion  billion and total interest expense of million million  million 
the increase in average borrowed funds for versus was primarily the result of increasing the size of our investment portfolio in connection with the investment of the proceeds of our preferred stock offering 
the increase in interest expense for versus was primarily the result of increasing the size of our investment portfolio and hedging costs from additional interest rate swaps 
the increase in average borrowed funds for versus was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio in connection with the investment of the proceeds of our follow on common stock offerings 
the increase in interest expense for versus was primarily the result of a higher average borrowing balance outstanding and higher average cost of funds 
for the year ended december   our average hedged cost of funds was  
since a substantial portion of our repurchase agreements are short term  changes in market rates are directly reflected in our interest expense 
interest expense includes borrowing costs under repurchase agreements  as well as any hedging costs 
net interest income our net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  for the year ended december   totaled million million  million 
our net interest rate margin for the year ended december   which equals the yield on our average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was  
the increase in net interest income for versus was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio with the net proceeds of our preferred stock offering 
the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a lower average earning asset yield 
the increase in net interest income for versus was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio with the net proceeds of our follow on common stock offerings 
the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to higher hedged cost of funds related to the increase in average borrowings and interest rate swaps 
gain on sale of investments as part of our investment process  all of our mbs are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if they continue to meet our risk and return targets 
this process involves looking at changing market assumptions and the impact those assumptions will have on the individual securities 
as a result of our change in market assumptions  we sold securities and recognized a net gain of approximately million for the year ended december  million  million 

table of contents loss on other than temporary impaired securities for the year ended december   we recognized no losses   on other than temporarily impaired securities in the consolidated statement of operations which had been included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
credit losses recognized during on non agency rmbs were anticipated and included in the price paid for the asset at acquisition and were included in the security s estimated yield at acquisition 
refer to note mortgage backed securities for the assessment of other than temporary impairment on our investment securities 
equity in earnings and change in fair value of unconsolidated ventures for the year ended december   we recognized equity in earnings and unrealized appreciation on the change in fair value of our investment in the invesco imrf fund of approximately million million  million and  unrealized loss of million  unrealized appreciation of million  respectively 
the decrease in equity in earnings and decrease in unrealized income on the change in fair value was primarily the result of realizing less gains on investments sold during and a decrease in the fair value of investments remaining in the invesco imrf fund at december  on september   we invested in a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans by contributing million  net of distributions  of equity to imrf loan portfolio member llc imrf llc 
for the year ended december   we recognized equity in earnings and unrealized loss on the change in fair value of our investment in the imrf llc of approximately million  and  unrealized appreciation of  respectively 
other income we finance our activities primarily through repurchase agreements  which are generally settled on a short term basis  usually from one to twelve months 
at each settlement date  we refinance each repurchase agreement at the market interest rate at that time 
since the interest rate on repurchase agreements change on a one to twelve month basis  we are continuously exposed to changing interest rates 
our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
to accomplish these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps and swaptions as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
the interest rate swaption provides us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount  stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future 
the premium paid for interest rate swaptions is reported as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets 
the premium is valued at an amount equal to the fair value of the swaption that would have the effect of closing the position adjusted for nonperformance risk  if any 
for the year ended december   our unrealized loss on interest rate swaps and swaptions consists of approximately    which represents the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps and million of unrealized losses which represents the change in fair value of our interest rate swaptions that are recognized directly in earnings 
on december   we entered into a credit default swap cds contract 
for the year ended december  we recognized income of million million   on our investment in the cds of which  million  is an unrealized gain based on change in the fair market value of the cds and million million   represents premium payments we receive for providing protection 

table of contents expenses for the year ended december   we incurred management fees of million million  million  which are payable to our manager under our management agreement 
the increase in management fees is attributable to an increase in shareholders equity resulting from our follow on common stock and preferred stock offerings in and see certain relationships  related transactions  and director independence for a discussion of the management fee and our relationship with our manager 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense of million million  million includes operating expenses not covered under our management agreement 
these expenses primarily consist of directors and officers insurance  accounting services  auditing and tax services  filing fees  and miscellaneous general and administrative costs 
net income after preferred dividends and return on average equity for the year ended december   our net income after preferred dividends was million million  million and our annualized return on average equity was  
the change in net income after preferred dividends and average return on equity was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio from the proceeds of our common and preferred stock offerings and the changes in our portfolio composition during and the decline in average return on equity was the result of lower asset yields on the portfolio as a result of the interest rate environment 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to pay dividends  fund investments  repayment of borrowings and other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consists of the net proceeds from our common and preferred equity offerings  net cash provided by operating activities  cash from repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements and future issuances of equity and or debt securities 
we are unable to offer securities in a public offering pursuant to our registration statement on form s asr during the month of march due to our failure to timely file our proxy statement 
we intend to file a new shelf registration on form s asr on or about april  we also have sought  and may continue to finance our assets under  and may otherwise participate in  programs established by the us government 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings  margin requirements and the payment of cash dividends as required for continued qualification as a reit 
we generally maintain liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage our long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on our balance sheet is significantly less important than our potential liquidity available under borrowing arrangements 
we held cash and cash equivalents of million at december  million 
our cash and cash equivalents increased due to normal fluctuations in cash balances related to the timing of principal and interest payments  repayments of debt  and asset purchases and sales 
our operating activities provided net cash of approximately million for the year ended december  million  million 
the cash provided by operating activities increased due to the increase in net interest income earned by our portfolio  which resulted from the increase in average interest earning assets of billion in investments at december  as compared to billion at december  and billion at december  our investing activities used net cash of billion for the year ended december  billion  billion 
during the year ended december  we utilized cash to purchase billion in securities which were offset by proceeds from asset sales of billion and principal payments of billion 
during the year ended december  we utilized cash to purchase billion in securities  sold billion of securities and received principal payments of billion 
during the year ended december  we utilized cash to purchase billion in securities and sold million of securities and received principal payments of million 
during and  we utilized proceeds generated from our financing activities to increase our investment portfolio  resulting in an increase in purchases of mortgage backed securities and an increase in principal payments 

table of contents our financing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of net proceeds from our preferred stock offering in which we raised approximately million in equity and net proceeds from our repurchase agreements of billion 
our financing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of net proceeds from our follow on common stock offerings in which we raised approximately billion in equity and net proceeds from our repurchase agreements of billion 
our financing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of net proceeds from our follow on common stock offerings in which we raised approximately million in equity and net proceeds from our repurchase agreements of billion 
the table below shows the allocation of our equity and debt to equity ratio as of december  the leverage on each class of assets may periodically exceed the stated ranges as we adjust our borrowings to obtain the best available source and minimize total interest expense while maintaining our overall portfolio leverage guidelines 
in thousands agency non agency cmbs unconsolidated ventures total borrowings equity allocation debt equity ratio of total equity as of december   the weighted average margin requirement  or the percentage amount by which the collateral value must exceed the loan amount  which we also refer to as the haircut  under our repurchase agreements for agency rmbs was weighted by borrowing amount  under our repurchase agreements for non agency rmbs was and under our repurchase agreements for cmbs was 
across our repurchase facilities for agency rmbs  the haircuts range from a low of to a high of  for non agency rmbs range from a low of to a high of and for cmbs range from a low of to a high of 
our hedged cost of funds was and as of december  and  respectively 
declines in the value of our securities portfolio can trigger margin calls by our lenders under our repurchase agreements 
an event of default or termination event would give some of our counterparties the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and require any amount due by us to the counterparties to be payable immediately 
as discussed above under market conditions  the residential mortgage market in the united states remains weak and is subject to the following conditions increased volatility of many financial assets  including agency securities and other high quality rmbs assets  due to potential security liquidations  continued volatility in the broader residential mortgage and rmbs markets despite signs of improvements  and significant disruption in financing of rmbs 
if these conditions persist  then our lenders may be forced to exit the repurchase market  become insolvent or further tighten lending standards or increase the amount of required equity capital or haircut  any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing 
in addition  because fannie mae and freddie mac are in conservatorship of the us government  if the us s credit rating is further downgraded  it may impact the credit risk associated with agency rmbs and other assets  and  therefore  decrease the value of the agency rmbs  non agency rbms and cmbs in our portfolio  which could cause our repurchase counterparties to make margin calls on our borrowings and swaps  if our collateral is insufficient to cover the debt secured by our assets 

table of contents effective as of may   we implemented the drspp  pursuant to which we registered and reserved for issuance  shares of our common stock 
under the terms of the drspp  shareholders who participate in the drspp may purchase shares of our common stock directly from us  in cash investments up to  or greater than  if we grant a request for waiver 
at our sole discretion  we may accept optional cash investments in excess of  per month  which may qualify for a discount from the market price of to 
the drspp participants may also automatically reinvest all or a portion of their dividends for additional shares of our stock 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock  shares  shares under the share purchase feature of our drspp 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of  shares of common stock  shares  shares under the waiver feature of the drspp 
due to a delay in filing our proxy statement  we are suspending the issuance of shares pursuant to the drspp during the month of march we intend to resume such sales on or about april  upon the filing of a new registration statement on form s asr 
on december   we announced a share repurchase program that was approved by our board of directors for up to million shares of our common stock 
the shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions  including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with rules b and b under the exchange act or by any combination of such methods 
the manner  price  number and timing of share repurchases will be subject to a variety of factors  including market conditions and applicable sec rules 
as of december   we have not repurchased any shares under this program 
effects of margin requirements  leverage and credit spreads our securities have values that fluctuate according to market conditions and  as discussed above  the market value of our securities will decrease as prevailing interest rates or credit spreads increase 
when the value of the securities pledged to secure a repurchase loan decreases to the point where the positive difference between the collateral value and the loan amount is less than the haircut  our lenders may issue a margin call  which means that the lender will require us to pay the margin call in cash or pledge additional collateral to meet that margin call 
under our repurchase facilities  our lenders have full discretion to determine the value of the securities we pledge to them 
most of our lenders will value securities based on recent trades in the market 
lenders also issue margin calls as the published current principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled paydowns are announced monthly 
we experience margin calls in the ordinary course of our business 
in seeking to effectively manage the margin requirements established by our lenders  we maintain a position of cash and unpledged securities 
we refer to this position as our liquidity 
the level of liquidity we have available to meet margin calls is directly affected by our leverage levels  our haircuts and the price changes on our securities 
if interest rates increase as a result of a yield curve shift or for another reason or if credit spreads widen  then the prices of our collateral and our unpledged assets that constitute our liquidity will decline  we will experience margin calls  and we will use our liquidity to meet the margin calls 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet any margin calls 
if our haircuts increase  our liquidity will proportionately decrease 
in addition  if we increase our borrowings  our liquidity will decrease by the amount of additional haircut on the increased level of indebtedness 
we intend to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our assets that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated margin calls but that also allows us to be substantially invested in securities 
we may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity  which would lower our investment returns  or by maintaining insufficient liquidity  which would force us to liquidate assets into unfavorable market conditions and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements regarding liquidity based upon our current portfolio  leverage rate and available borrowing arrangements  we believe that cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short term one year or less liquidity requirements to fund our investment activities  pay fees under our management agreement  fund our distributions to shareholders and for other general corporate expenses 
our ability to meet our long term greater than one year liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to obtaining additional debt financing 
we may increase our capital resources by obtaining long term credit facilities or through public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  and senior or subordinated notes 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and our ability to invest such offering proceeds 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents contractual obligations we have entered into an agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses 
the management fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to of our shareholders equity  per annum 
our manager uses the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and personnel who  notwithstanding that certain of those individuals are also our officers  receive no cash compensation directly from us 
we are required to reimburse our manager for operating expenses related to us incurred by our manager  including certain salary expenses and other expenses relating to legal  accounting  due diligence and other services 
expense reimbursements to our manager are made in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month 
our reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation 
refer to note related party transactions for details of our reimbursements to our manager 
contractual commitments as of december   we had the following contractual commitments and commercial obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years repurchase agreements invesco imrf fund and aiv fund total contractual obligations as of december   we have approximately million in contractual interest payments related to our repurchase agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we committed to invest up to million in the invesco imrf fund  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
in march  invesco imrf fund returned substantially all of its proceeds and repaid all financing under the ppip 
the company is awaiting final distribution from the invesco imrf fund 
as of december  and  approximately million and million of the commitment has been called  respectively 
we also utilize credit derivatives  such as credit default swaps  to provide credit event protection based on a financial index or specific security in exchange for receiving a fixed rate fee or premium over the term of the contract 
these instruments enable us to synthetically assume the credit risk of a reference security  portfolio of securities or index of securities 
the counterparty pays a premium to us and we agree to make a payment to compensate the counterparty for losses upon the occurrence of a specified credit event 
although contract specific  credit events generally include bankruptcy  failure to pay  restructuring  obligation acceleration  obligation default  or repudiation moratorium 
upon the occurrence of a defined credit event  the difference between the value of the reference obligation and the cds s notional amount is recorded as realized loss in the statement of operations 
our only cds contract was entered into on december  we sold protection against losses on a specific pool of non agency rmbs in the event they exceed a specified loss limit of of the balance of the non agency rmbs on the trade date 
the maximum exposure is the remaining unpaid principal balance of the underlying rmbs in excess of the specified loss threshold 
in exchange  we are paid a stated fixed rate fee of 
we are required to post collateral as security for potential loss payments 
we posted collateral to secure potential loss payments of million as of december  million 
the remaining notional amount of the cds is million at december  compared to million at december   and we estimated the fair market value of the cds to be million at december  compared to million at december  as of december   we have not made any payments related to the cds contract 

table of contents shareholders equity on july   we completed a public offering of an initial issuance of million shares of its series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  or the series a preferred stock  at the price of per share 
on august   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option in part to purchase an additional  shares of the series a preferred stock  at the price of per share 
total proceeds were million  net of issuance costs of million 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock at an average price of under the share repurchase feature of our drspp with total proceeds to us of approximately million  net of issuance costs of  unrealized gains and losses since we account for our investment securities as available for sale  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our us gaap income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and shareholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  unrealized fluctuations in market values of our cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting are also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for the year ended december   net unrealized losses included in shareholders equity is million million loss  million gain 
the increase in net unrealized loss is primarily attributable to changes in the market values of our cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting 
refer to note mortgage backed securities and note derivative and hedging activities for more details on the unrealized gains and losses in both our investment securities and our cash flow hedges 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
share based compensation we established the equity incentive plan for grants of restricted common stock and other equity based awards to our independent  non executive directors  and to the officers and employees of the manager the incentive plan 
under the incentive plan  a total of  shares are currently reserved for issuance 
unless terminated earlier  the incentive plan will terminate in  but will continue to govern the unexpired awards 
effective july   our three independent  non executive directors are each eligible to receive  in restricted common stock annually 
for the year ended december   we recognized compensation expense of approximately    and issued  shares  shares   shares of restricted stock to our independent  non executive directors pursuant to the incentive plan 
the number of shares issued was determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on the actual date of grant 
dividends we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock and preferred stock 
us federal income tax law generally requires that a reit distribute annually at least of its reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains  and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than of its taxable income 

table of contents we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders in an amount equal at least of our net taxable income 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our repurchase agreements and other debt payable 
if our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income  we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions  or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
unrelated business taxable income we have not engaged in transactions that would result in a portion of our income being treated as unrelated business taxable income 
other matters we believe that we satisfied each of the asset tests in section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code at the end of each calendar quarter in we also believe that our revenue qualifies for the gross income test and for the gross income test for the taxable year ended december  we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of dividends for the taxable year ended december  therefore  as of december   we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code 
at all times  we intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor our operating partnership nor the subsidiaries of our operating partnership are required to register as an investment company under the act 
if we were required to register as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
because we are a holding company that conducts our business through our operating partnership and the operating partnership s wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  the securities issued by these subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the act  together with any other investment securities the operating partnership may own  may not have a combined value in excess of of the value of the operating partnership s total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis  which we refer to as the test 
this requirement limits the types of businesses in which we are permitted to engage in through our subsidiaries 
in addition  we believe neither we nor the operating partnership are considered an investment company under section a a of the act because they do not engage primarily or hold themselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities 
rather  through the operating partnership s wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  we and the operating partnership are primarily engaged in the non investment company businesses of these subsidiaries 
ias asset i llc and certain of the operating partnership s other subsidiaries that we may form in the future rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the act provided by section c c of the act  which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
this exclusion generally requires that at least of each subsidiary s portfolio be comprised of qualifying assets and at least be comprised of qualifying assets and real estate related assets and no more than comprised of miscellaneous assets 
qualifying assets for this purpose generally include mortgage loans fully secured by real estate and other assets  such as whole pool agency and non agency rmbs  that the sec or its staff in various no action letters has determined are the functional equivalent of mortgage loans fully secured by real estate 
we treat as real estate related assets cmbs  debt and equity securities of companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses  agency partial pool certificates and securities issued by pass through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets and or real estate related assets 
additionally  unless certain mortgage securities represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mbs may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december   we conducted our business so as not to be regulated as an investment company under the act 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary components of our market risk are related to interest rate  principal prepayment and market value 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors beyond our control 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and our repurchase agreements 
our repurchase agreements are typically of limited duration and will be periodically refinanced at current market rates 
we mitigate this risk through utilization of derivative contracts  primarily interest rate swap agreements  interest rate caps and interest rate floors 
interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results depend in large part upon differences between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and interest rate hedging activities 
most of our repurchase agreements provide financing based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over libor 
the fixed spread will vary depending on the type of underlying asset which collateralizes the financing 
accordingly  the portion of our portfolio which consists of floating interest rate assets are match funded utilizing our expected sources of short term financing  while our fixed interest rate assets are not match funded 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with our investments tend to increase while the income earned on our fixed interest rate investments may remain substantially unchanged 
this increase in borrowing costs results in the narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses 
further  during this portion of the interest rate and credit cycles  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
such delinquencies or defaults could also have an adverse effect on the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our rmbs 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the rmbs will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
interest rate effects on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the market value of the assets that we acquire 
we face the risk that the market value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than those of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities 
duration measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities 
the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change materially 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly in the event interest rates change materially 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  changes in actual interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents prepayment risk as we receive prepayments of principal on our investments  premiums paid on these investments are amortized against interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the investments 
conversely  discounts on such investments are accreted into interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby increasing the interest income earned on the investments 
extension risk we compute the projected weighted average life of our investments based upon assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages 
in general  when a fixed rate or hybrid adjustable rate security is acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates  because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related target asset 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  then the life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument  while the income earned on the hybrid adjustable rate assets would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our hybrid adjustable rate assets to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
market risk market value risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to asc topic the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase 
the sensitivity analysis table presented below shows the estimated impact of an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve  up and down and basis points  on the market value of our interest rate sensitive investments and net interest income  at december   assuming a static portfolio 
when evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates  prepayment assumptions and principal reinvestment rates are adjusted based on our manager s expectations 
the analysis presented utilized assumptions  models and estimates of our manager based on our manager s judgment and experience 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value real estate risk residential and commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as the supply of housing stock  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  and retroactive changes to building or similar codes 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 

table of contents credit risk we believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our credit losses and financing costs low 
however  we retain the risk of potential credit losses on all of the residential and commercial mortgage loans  as well as the loans underlying the non agency rmbs and cmbs in our portfolio 
we seek to manage this risk through our pre acquisition due diligence process 
in addition  with respect to any particular asset  our manager s investment team evaluates  among other things  relative valuation  supply and demand trends  shape of yield curves  prepayment rates  delinquency and default rates  recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our reit qualification  we seek to manage risk exposure to protect our investment portfolio against the effects of major interest rate changes 
we generally seek to manage this risk by monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our target assets and our financings  attempting to structure our financing agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements but also financial futures  options  interest rate cap agreements  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our target assets and our borrowings  and actively managing  on an aggregate basis  the interest rate indices  interest rate adjustment periods  and gross reset margins of our target assets and the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our financings
