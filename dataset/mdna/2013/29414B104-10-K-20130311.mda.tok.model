table of contents change in presentation of certain financial information as part of our discussion and analysis  we analyze revenues by vertical 
the composition and organization of our verticals is fluid and the structure changes regularly in response to overall growth  new business acquisitions and changes in reporting structure 
prior to the third quarter of  certain individually insignificant customers pertaining to acquired operations were aggregated for the purposes of presenting revenue by vertical 
effective third quarter of  we have individually reassigned these customers to corresponding verticals 
we believe this change is preferable as it allows us to more effectively analyze our verticals by aligning presentation of existing and acquired customers using a standardized approach 
these changes do not result in any adjustments to our previously issued financial statements and were applied retrospectively beginning on january  as presented in the tables below 
additionally  we have revised our disclosures to present travel and hospitality and retail and consumer verticals as a single travel and consumer vertical

the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls  we discuss two key measures that are not calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the first non gaap measure is income from operations  as reported on our consolidated and condensed statements of income and comprehensive income  excluding certain expenses and benefits  which we refer to as non gaap income from operations 
the second measure calculates non gaap income from operations as a percentage of reported revenues  which we refer to as non gaap operating margin 
we believe that these non gaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business  and we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally  manage our business  and evaluate our performance 
we also believe these measures help investors compare our operating performance with our results in prior periods and compare our operating results with those of similar companies 
we exclude certain expenses and benefits from non gaap income from operations that we believe are not reflective of these underlying business trends and are not useful measures in determining our operational performance and overall business strategy 
because our reported non gaap financial measures are not calculated according to gaap  these measures are not comparable to gaap and may not be comparable to similarly described non gaap measures reported by other companies within our industry 
consequently  our non gaap financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation from or supplant comparable gaap measures  but  rather  should be considered together with our consolidated and condensed financial statements  which are prepared according to gaap 
the following table presents a reconciliation of income from operations as reported on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to non gaap income from operations and non gaap operating margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands  except percent gaap income from operations stock based compensation one time charges goodwill impairment amortization of purchased intangible assets m a costs legal claims write off and recovery non gaap income from operations gaap operating margin effect of the adjustments detailed above non gaap operating margin cost of revenue includes stock based compensation expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

table of contents effects of inflation economies in cis countries such as belarus  russia and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation 
in particular  over a three year period ending december   significant inflation has been reported in belarus 
the national statistical committee of belarus estimated that inflation was approximately in  in and in in  and we had  and of our revenues  respectively  denominated in belarusian rubles 
the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments  including increasing interest rates and the use of anti monopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods  as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize local currency 
inflation  government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed materially to economic uncertainty in belarus 
belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future 
the russian and ukrainian governments have historically implemented similar measures as belarus to fight inflation 
periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries 
inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses  which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and  as a result  may reduce our profitability 
inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counter inflationary measures that may harm our financial condition  results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities

as such  revenues by client location differ from the segment information in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  which is not solely based on the geographic location of the clients but rather is based on managerial responsibility for a particular client regardless of client location

table of contents year ended december  in thousands  except percent revenues revenues by contract type our services are performed under both time and material and fixed price arrangements 
our engagement models depend on the type of services provided to a client  the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve 
historically  the majority of our revenues have been generated under time and material contracts 
under time and material contracts  we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly  daily or monthly rates 
fixed price contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on pre agreed intervals 
we expect time and material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of and of our revenues in coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years  respectively

operating expenses cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries  employee benefits and stock compensation expense  travel costs and subcontractor fees 
salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are allocated to cost of revenues regardless of whether they are actually performing services during a given period 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and include such items as senior management  administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries  stock compensation expense and related fringe benefits  legal and audit expenses  commissions  insurance  operating lease expenses  travel costs and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities 
in addition  we pay a membership fee of of revenues collected in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hi tech park 
our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations  acquisitions  and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues 
provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance  if any  involves judgment 
as a global company  we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
during  and  we had million  million and million  respectively  in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions 
the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory us tax rate 
additionally  we have secured special tax benefits in belarus and hungary as described below 
as a result  our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes due to the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions 
the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions  as well as the related net interest 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hi tech park  in which member technology companies are exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 
the on high technologies park decree  which created the belarus hi tech park  is in effect for a period of years from july  our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of of annual qualified salaries  taken over a four year period  for up to of the total tax due for that period

we do not hold our segment managers accountable for these expenses  as they cannot influence these costs within the scope of their operating authority  nor do we believe it is practical to allocate these costs to specific segments as they are not directly attributable to any specific segment 
all our segments are treated consistently with respect to such expenses when determining segment operating profit

table of contents liquidity and capital resources capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
at december   of our total million of cash and cash equivalents  million was held outside the united states  including million held in us dollar denominated accounts in belarus  which accrued at an average interest rate of during the year ended december  we have a revolving line of credit with pnc bank  national association 
effective january   we entered into a new agreement with the bank credit facility which increased our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit from million to million and extended maturity of the new facility to january  advances under the new line of credit accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the london interbank offer rate  or libor  plus 
the credit facility is secured by all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets  as well as by of the stock of domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries of epam systems  inc the line of credit also contains customary financial and reporting covenants and limitations 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our revolving line of credit and believe that our revolving line of credit provides sufficient flexibility such that we will remain in compliance with its terms in the foreseeable future 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the then effective line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds 
we are not  however  restricted in repatriating those funds back to the united states  if necessary 
if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends  million would be subject to foreign withholding taxes  of which million would also be subject to us corporate income tax 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long term capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate  if any  at which our cash flows increase  our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside the united states and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing 
to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions  we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions

our outstanding commitment at december  was approximately million 
the construction is expected to be completed in we intend to use the apartments for general business purposes 
in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved the employee housing program the housing program  which assists employees in purchasing housing in belarus 
we do not bear any market risk in connection with the housing program as the housing will be sold directly to employees by independent third parties 
as part of the housing program  we will extend financing to employees up to an aggregate amount of million 
the loans will be issued in us dollars with a year term and bear an interest rate of  which is significantly below the market interest rate in belarus 
the housing program was designed to be a retention mechanism for our employees in belarus and will be available to full time employees who have been with epam for at least three years 

table of contents future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives  including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate cash  however  is subject to our performance  general economic conditions  industry trends and other factors 
to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur 
if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness  we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business 
there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
off balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements within the scope of fasb asc paragraph guarantees topic other than as disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedules audited consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
accordingly  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows are not subject to material off balance sheet risks 
critical accounting policies we prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions  and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions  which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements  you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies  ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the audited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from software development services 
we recognize revenues when realized or realizable and earned  which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
at the time revenues are recognized  we provide for client incentive programs and reduce revenues accordingly 
we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned 
such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods 
unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms 
all such amounts are anticipated to be realized in subsequent periods 
our services are performed under both time and material and fixed price contracts arrangements 
for revenues generated under time and material contracts  revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred 
the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client 

table of contents we recognize revenues from fixed price contracts based on the proportional performance method 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system or solution is specified by the client  revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenues are recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known 
our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of twelve months or less 
we enter into multiple element arrangements with our clients under time and material and fixed fee contracts 
in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we adopted this standard effective january  for all new or amended contracts  and it did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations  or change our units of accounting and how we allocate the arrangement consideration to various units of accounting 
these arrangements consist of development services and other service deliverables that qualify for separate units of accounting 
these other services include maintenance and support services for our time and material contracts and separately priced warranties for our fixed fee contracts 
these deliverables qualify for multiple units of accounting and therefore arrangement consideration is allocated among the units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price is based on the price charged for the deliverable when it is sold separately 
for multiple element arrangements under time and material contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed for each deliverable 
for arrangements under fixed fee contracts  revenue is recognized upon delivery of development services under the proportional performance method and on a straight line basis over the warranty period 
the warranty period is generally six months to two years 
we report gross reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each client  historical collections experience and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
recoveries of losses from accounts receivable written off in prior years are presented within income from operations on our consolidated statements of income 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
we do not amortize goodwill but perform a test for impairment annually  or when indications of potential impairment exist  utilizing a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
we determine fair value using the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units to which goodwill relates and determine the carrying value book value of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units 
we amortize other intangible assets with determinable lives over their estimated useful lives 
we record an impairment charge on these assets when we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
when there exists one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
its fair value is determined based on projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
the estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal  state  local and foreign taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the audited consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed 
changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes 
we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings 
any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 
once a valuation allowance has been established  it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is no longer more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance 
if the allowance is reversed in a future period  the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced 
accordingly  the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 
changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future 
the american taxpayer relief act of the act was signed into law on january  because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment  certain provisions of the act benefiting our us federal taxes  including the subpart f controlled foreign corporation look through exception cannot be recognized in our financial results 
the impact  if any  will be reflected in our financial results 
accounting for stock based employee compensation plans stock based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and non employee directors is determined based on the grant date fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest 
we recognize these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from those estimates 
such revisions could have a material effect on our operating results 
the assumptions used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared to the awards previously granted 
earnings per share basic eps is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the same period 
our series a preferred  series a preferred  and series a preferred stock  that had been outstanding and convertible into common stock until february  the date of our initial public offering  and our puttable common stock were considered participating securities since these securities had non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents during the contractual period and thus required the two class method of computing eps 
when calculating diluted eps  the numerator is computed by adding back the undistributed earnings allocated to the participating securities in arriving at the basic eps and then reallocating such undistributed earnings among our common stock  participating securities and the potential common shares that result from the assumed exercise of all dilutive options 
the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding had the options been issued 
no preferred stock was outstanding as of december   as a result of our initial public offering on february  when all convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedules audited consolidated financial statements  regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our audited consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  and concentration of credit risks 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 

table of contents concentration of credit and other risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues 
these financial instruments approximate fair value due to short term maturities 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments with financial institutions 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and  accordingly  do not require collateral 
we maintain our cash with financial institutions 
as of december   million of total cash was held in cis countries  with million of that in belarus 
banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets  and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application 
banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets  and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards 
furthermore  bank deposits made by corporate entities in cis are not insured 
as a result  the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability 
another banking crisis  or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds  particularly in belarus  may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis  which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across our clients in proportion to their revenues 
during the years ended december  and  our top five clients accounted for and of our total revenues  respectively 
during and  our largest client  thomson reuters  accounted for over of our revenues  however  there were no customers accounting for over of our revenues in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues for this client were and of total accounts receivable and unbilled revenues  respectively  as of december  credit losses and write offs of trade accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our audited consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit bearing interest at libor plus rate 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility 
we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates 
however  our future interest expense may increase and interest income may fall due to changes in market interest rates 
foreign exchange risk our audited consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in canada  europe  the cis and cee regions and generate a significant portion of our revenues in certain non us dollar currencies  principally  euros  british pounds and russian rubles 
we incur expenditures in non us dollar currencies  principally in hungarian forints  euros and russian rubles associated with our delivery centers located in cee 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in these foreign currencies and cash flows for expenditures in foreign currencies 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange volatility 
our results of operations can be affected if the euro and or the british pound appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar 
our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues and expenses 
based on our results of operations for the year ended december   a appreciation depreciation of the euro against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase decrease of approximately million in net income  and appreciation depreciation of the british pound against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase decrease of approximately million in net income 
to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations  appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion 
sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations 
the analysis quantifies the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period  most commonly within a one year period 
the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 

table of contents changes in the currency exchange rates resulted in our reporting a net transactional foreign currency exchange loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
additionally  foreign currency translation adjustments from translating financials statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currency to the us dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity or included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income if local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries differ from their functional currencies 
during the years ended december    and we recorded million of translation gain  and million and million of translation losses within our consolidated accumulated other comprehensive income  respectively 
additionally  we recorded million and million of translation losses in and  and million of translation gain in within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
