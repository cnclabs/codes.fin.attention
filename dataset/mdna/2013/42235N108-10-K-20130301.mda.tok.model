overview general our primary business is to provide bankcard payment processing services to merchants in the united states 
this involves facilitating the exchange of information and funds between merchants and cardholders financial institutions  providing end to end electronic payment processing services to merchants  including merchant set up and training  transaction authorization and electronic draft capture  clearing and settlement  merchant accounting  merchant assistance and support  and risk management 
our card accepting customers primarily fall into two categories our core small and mid sized merchants referred to as small and midsized enterprises  or sme merchants and network services merchants  predominately petroleum industry merchants of all sizes referred to as network services merchants 
we provide additional services to sme merchants  such as full service payroll processing and related tax filing services  marketing solutions including loyalty and gift cards which we provide through heartland marketing solutions  and we sell and rent point of sale devices 
we also provide school nutrition  point of sale solutions  and associated payment solutions  including online prepayment solutions  through heartland school solutions  open and closed loop payment solutions and higher education loan services to colleges and universities through campus solutions  and prepaid and stored value card solutions through micropayments 
at december   we provided our bankcard payment processing services to approximately  active sme bankcard merchants located across the united states 
this represents a slight decrease over the  active sme bankcard merchants at december  at december   we provided bankcard payment processing services to approximately network services merchants with approximately  locations 
additionally  at december   we provided bankcard payment processing services to approximately  merchants in canada through our owned subsidiary collective pos solutions ltd 
cpos 
we sold our interest in cpos in a transaction settled in january cpos has historically represented an insignificant component of our financial position and results of operations 
however  as further disclosed elsewhere in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we will recognize a gain on the sale of cpos in the first quarter of  which gain will likely be material to the results for the quarter ending march  as a result  we presented the net assets of cpos as held for sale at december  and present the results of operations for cpos as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
our total bankcard processing volume for the year ended december  was billion  a increase from the billion processed during the year ended december  our sme bankcard processing volume for the year ended december  was billion  a increase over billion in  reflecting increases for same store sales growth  new sme merchants installed  and lower merchant attrition 
our bankcard processing volume for also includes billion of settled volume for network services merchants  compared to billion for network 
table of contents services increase for the period primarily reflects the expansion of a contract with a large petroleum merchant to include back end settlement 
bankcard processing volume for the years ended december   and was as follows year ended december  in millions sme merchants network services merchants canada total bankcard processing volume a a bankcard processing volume includes volume for credit and signature debit transactions 
merchant attrition is expected in the card payment processing industry in the ordinary course of business 
we experience attrition in merchant bankcard processing volume resulting from several factors  including business closures  transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors and account closures that we initiate due to heightened credit risks relating to  or contract breaches by  merchants  and when applicable same store sales contraction 
we measure sme processing volume attrition against all sme merchants that were processing with us in the same month a year earlier 
during the year ended december   we experienced an improved average annualized attrition in our sme bankcard processing volume compared to an average attrition of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in our sme business  we measure same store sales growth  or contraction  as the change in bankcard processing volume for all bankcard merchants that were processing with us in the same month a year earlier 
in  same store sales grew on average  compared to and same store sales growth in and  respectively 
same store sales growth or contraction results from the combination of the increasing or decreasing use by consumers of bankcards for the purchase of goods and services at the point of sale  and sales growth or contraction experienced by our retained sme bankcard merchants 
historically  our same store sales experience has tracked overall economic conditions 
the following table compares our same store sales growth or contraction during   and same store sales growth contraction first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we measure the overall production of our sales force by new gross margin installed  which reflects the expected annual gross profit from a merchant contract after deducting processing and servicing costs associated with that revenue 
we measure installed margin primarily for our sme card processing  payroll processing and loyalty and gift card marketing businesses 
our newly installed gross margin for the year ended december  increased from the gross margin we installed during the year ended december  we attribute this increase in newly installed gross margin to higher volumes and margins at newly installed merchants and improved individual productivity achieved by our salespersons 
we expect to drive increases in year over year installed margin in future periods primarily by increasing our relationship manager and territory manager count 
our combined relationship managers and territory managers count amounted to  and at december   december  and december   respectively 
in addition  ovation employed sales persons as of december  who have augmented our sales force 
the bankcard revenue we earn in our sme business is recurring in nature  as we typically enter into three year service contracts with our card processing sme merchants that  in order to qualify for the agreed upon pricing  require the merchant to achieve bankcard processing volume minimums 
most of our sme revenue is from payment processing fees  which are a combination of a fee equal to a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction we process plus a flat fee per transaction 
we make mandatory payments of interchange fees to the card issuer through the card networks and dues  assessments and other network fees to visa  mastercard and discover 
our sme gross bankcard processing revenue is largely driven by the visa and mastercard volume processed by our merchants 
we also realize card processing revenues from processing transactions for our sme merchants accepting american express and from processing discover transactions 
in contrast to sme card processing revenues  revenues from our network services merchants are largely driven by the number of transactions we process whether settled  or only authorized  not our processing volume  as the merchants which comprise network services customer base pay on a per transaction basis for processing services 
network services increased number of transactions processed for the period primarily reflects the expansion of a contract with a large petroleum 
table of contents merchant to include back end settlement 
additionally  we provide authorization  settlement and account servicing services on our front and back end systems for american express transactions for larger merchants  and merchants signed to american express by other processors  for those services we receive compensation from american express on a per transaction basis 
the number of transactions we processed for network services merchants and american express for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  network services merchants in thousands settled authorized total network services american express a total a includes only those transactions not eligible for residual compensation our internally developed front end authorization systems  hps exchange  vaps and nws  provide us greater control of the electronic transaction process  allow us to offer our merchants a differentiated product offering  and offer economies of scale that we expect will increase our long term profitability 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our sme transactions were processed through hps exchange 
all of our network services transactions were processed through vaps or nws 
we provide clearing  settlement and merchant accounting services through our own internally developed back end processing system  passport 
passport enables us to customize these services to the needs of our relationship managers and merchants 
at both december  and  approximately of total sme bankcard merchants were processing on passport 
in the fourth quarter of  the clearing  settlement and merchant accounting services for network services settled transactions were converted onto passport  so that since december   our internal systems have been providing all aspects of our network services merchants processing needs 
we provide payroll processing services throughout the united states 
on december   we acquired ovation payroll  inc ovation adding over  customers to our existing payroll business 
at december   we processed payroll for  customers  including ovation  an increase of from  payroll customers at december  in  and  we installed   and  new payroll processing customers in our existing business  respectively  excluding ovation installation activity 
we operate a comprehensive payroll management system  which we refer to as plusone payroll  that streamlines all aspects of the payroll process to enable time and cost savings 
plusone payroll was made available to new and existing customers beginning in we fully converted all of our existing payroll customers to plusone payroll in the plusone payroll platform enables us to process payroll on a large scale and provide customizable solutions for businesses of all sizes 
the acquisition of ovation will add scale to our plusone payroll platform  leveraging operating costs once conversion is complete in  and also adds management  salespersons to our sme sales force  a new sales approach including an affinity partner network and enhanced product and servicing capabilities 
we provide school nutrition  point of sale solutions  and associated payment solutions including online prepayment  to k to schools throughout the united states 
at december   our heartland school solutions business provided services to over  public and private schools  compared to over  public and private schools at december  our heartland school solutions business has been built through a series of five acquisitions in  and on june   we acquired the k to school solutions business of lunch byte systems  inc accounting for the increase in the number of schools served in we provide open and closed loop payment solutions and higher education loan services to campuses throughout the united states and canada 
at december   our campus solutions business served more than  colleges and universities  compared to approximately at december  the increase reflects our acquisition of educational computer systems  inc ecsi on december   expanding our campus solutions business into higher education and post graduate school student services 
financial highlights our financial results for the year ended december  benefited from an improved operating margin  reflecting year over year growth in net revenue and a moderate increase in processing and servicing costs compared to december  for  we recorded net income of million  or per share compared to net income of million  or per share  in the following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended december  
table of contents net revenue  which we define as total revenues less interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees  increased to million during from million during the increase in net revenue was driven by the increased card processing net revenue from our sme merchants and increases in heartland school solutions revenues  payroll processing revenues  and equipment related revenues 
sme bankcard processing volume increased to billion  compared to billion in the year over year increase reflects same stores sales growth  improved merchant volume attrition  and increased processing activity from new sme merchants installed 
processing and servicing expenses for increased by million or  compared with the increase in processing and servicing expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased costs associated with processing and servicing higher sme bankcard processing volume  increased residual commission expense and increased cost of sales and servicing related to higher heartland school solutions  payroll processing  and loyalty and gift revenues 
the increase in processing and servicing expense also reflects refined allocations of certain information technology related expenses  previously reported in general and administrative expense  to processing and servicing in the year ended december  partially offsetting the increases in processing and servicing expense were decreases in merchant losses  service center expense and card related equipment costs 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to an million increase in personnel costs  including a million increase for share based compensation and increased personnel costs related to the heartland school solutions acquisitions 
our income from operations  which we also refer to as operating income  increased to million for from million in primarily due to the growth of our net revenue and lower increases in processing and servicing expense 
our operating margin  which is measured as operating income divided by net revenue  was for  compared to for see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for a more detailed discussion of our full year operating results 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
our revenues fall into three categories gross processing revenue  payroll processing revenue and equipment related revenue 
our gross processing revenue primarily consists of discount  per transaction and periodic primarily monthly fees from the processing of visa  mastercard  american express and discover transactions for our sme merchants and per transaction fees for the authorization and settlement of transactions by network services 
gross processing revenue also includes american express and discover servicing fees  customer service fees  fees for processing chargebacks  termination fees on terminated contracts  heartland school solutions fees primarily fees associated with processing online prepayments  campus solutions revenue including revenue associated with providing solutions to support administrative services for higher education including student loan payment processing  delinquency and default services  refund management  tuition payment plans  electronic billing and payment  tax document services  and business outsourcing  gift and loyalty card fees and other miscellaneous revenue 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
payroll processing revenue includes fees charged by our subsidiary  heartland payroll company  for payroll processing services  including check printing  direct deposit  related federal  state and local tax deposits and providing accounting documentation and interest income earned on funds held for customers 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
in the future  payroll processing revenues will include income earned by ovation 
equipment related revenue includes revenues from the sale  rental and deployment of bankcard terminals 
our equipment related income also includes revenues from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for prepaid card and stored value card payment systems  campus solutions and heartland school solutions 
equipment revenues are recorded at the time of shipment  or the provision of service 
most of these revenue items tend to grow with our overall merchant and customer growth 
expenses 
our most significant expense is interchange fees  which are set by the card networks  and are paid to the card issuing banks 
for our sme bankcard processing  we do not offset bankcard processing revenues and interchange fees because our business practice is to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their daily transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
as network services does not advance interchange fees to its merchants  we record its portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees 
interchange fees are calculated as a percentage of the dollar volume processed plus a per transaction fee 
we also pay visa  mastercard and discover  as well as certain pin network dues  
table of contents assessments and fees  which are a combination of a percentage of the dollar volume processed and per transaction fees 
interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
it is our policy to pass along to our merchants any changes in interchange fees and card network dues  assessments and fees 
since the card networks regularly adjust those rates  our gross processing revenue will increase or decrease  but all the impact of such changes will be paid to the card issuing banks and our income from operations will not be affected 
costs of services also include processing and servicing costs  customer acquisition costs  and depreciation and amortization 
processing and servicing costs include processing costs  which are either paid to third parties  including our bank sponsors  or represent the cost of our own authorization capture and accounting settlement systems 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs 
approximately and  respectively  of our third party processing costs in and were paid to fujitsu for processing network services transactions 
approximately and and respectively  of our third party processing costs in and were paid to tsys acquiring solutions  residual commission payments to our relationship managers  sales managers  trade associations  agent banks and value added resellers  which are a percentage of the gross margin we generated from our merchant contracts during the accounting period  the costs of operating our service center and other customer support locations  including telecommunications costs  personnel costs  occupancy costs  losses due to merchant defaults  depreciation and amortization  and other direct servicing costs  and the costs of bankcard terminals and pos systems  and the costs of hardware deployed for campus solutions  heartland school solutions  micropayments  and merchant supplies 
customer acquisition costs reflect the amortization over the initial three year contract term of the cash signing bonus paid and the deferred acquisition costs for vested relationship managers and sales managers  as well as changes in the accrued buyout liability  which reflect the impact of buying out residual commissions see critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability and volume attrition 
depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we have made significant capital expenditures for computer hardware and software and such costs are generally depreciated over three to five years 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other administrative expenses related to our information technology infrastructure costs  our marketing expenses and other administrative functions 
other income expense consists of interest income on cash and investments  interest expense on our borrowings  write downs of capitalized information technology development projects  gain from the sale of merchant bankcard processing contracts  legal settlements accrued or received  exit costs  and other non operating income or expense items  including those related to the processing system intrusion announced by us in critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the critical accounting estimates described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations  including those whose application requires management most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the line items on our income statement and balance sheet  which are impacted by management estimates  are described below 
revenue our bankcard processing revenue is derived from processing and settling visa  mastercard  american express and discover bankcard transactions for our merchant customers 
our most significant expense related to the generation of those revenues is interchange fees  which are set by the card networks  and paid to the card issuing banks 
for our sme merchant bankcard processing  we do not offset bankcard processing revenues and interchange fees in our income statement because our business practice is to advance the interchange fees to most of our sme merchants when settling their daily transactions 
table of contents thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
we fund interchange advances to our sme merchants from a combination of our operating cash and advances from our sponsor banks 
we believe this policy aids in new business generation  as our merchants benefit from bookkeeping simplicity 
however  this practice results in our carrying a large receivable from our merchants at each period end  and a corresponding but smaller payable to our sponsor banks  which are settled on the first business day after the period end 
as we are at risk for the receivables  we record the associated revenues on a gross processing revenue basis in our consolidated statements of income 
certain of our competitors report their processing revenue net of interchange fees 
this is because the card issuing banks make their payments to these competitors net of those interchange fees  and these acquirers pay this reduced amount to their merchants 
for our network services merchants  we also record a portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees because the daily cash settlement with network services merchants is net of interchange fees 
capitalized customer acquisition costs capitalized customer acquisition costs consist of up front signing bonuses paid to relationship managers and sales managers  referred to as the salesperson or salespersons  for the establishment of new merchant relationships  and deferred acquisition cost representing the estimated cost of buying out the commissions of vested salespersons at some point in the future 
capitalized customer acquisition costs represent incremental  direct customer acquisition costs that are recoverable through gross margins associated with sme merchant contracts 
the capitalized customer acquisition costs are amortized using a method which approximates a proportional revenue approach over the initial three year term of the merchant contract 
the amount of the up front signing bonus paid for new sme bankcard  payroll and loyalty marketing accounts is based on the estimated gross margin for the first year of the merchant contract 
the gross signing bonuses paid during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the signing bonus paid  amount capitalized  and related amortization are adjusted at the end of the first year to reflect the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during that year 
the net signing bonus adjustments made during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
negative signing bonus adjustments occur when the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during the first year is less than the estimated gross margin for that year  resulting in the overpayment of the up front signing bonus  which overpayment would be recovered from the relevant salesperson 
positive signing bonus adjustments result from prior underpayments of up front signing bonuses  and would be paid to the relevant salesperson 
the amount of signing bonuses paid which remained subject to adjustment at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the deferred acquisition cost component of capitalized customer acquisition costs is accrued for vested salespersons over the first year of sme bankcard merchant processing  consistent with the build up in the accrued buyout liability  which is described below 
management evaluates the capitalized customer acquisition costs for impairment by comparing  on a pooled basis by vintage month of origination  the expected future net cash flows from underlying merchant relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized customer acquisition costs 
if the estimated future net cash flows are lower than the recorded carrying amount  indicating an impairment of the value of the capitalized customer acquisition costs  the impairment loss will be charged to operations 
at december   we recognized an impairment charge related to the decision to discontinue express funds  our remote deposit check capture product 
we have not recognized an impairment loss in or accrued buyout liability we pay our salespersons residual commissions based on the gross margin generated from the monthly processing activity of sme merchants signed by them 
we refer to these residual commissions as the owned portion of such commissions  or portfolio equity 
the salesperson has no obligation to perform additional services for the merchant for so long as the merchant continues processing with us 
we accrue the buyout liability  which represents the estimated current settlement cost of buying out all vested and expected to vest salespersons for the owned portion of such commissions 
we also record a deferred acquisition cost asset related to those buyouts  and amortize that asset as an expense over the initial three year contract term 
beginning in june  our salespersons earn portfolio equity on their newly installed payroll and loyalty marketing merchant accounts based on the residual commissions they earn on those accounts 
the accrued buyout liability and deferred acquisition cost asset related to these payroll and loyalty marketing merchant accounts are developed the same as the sme card merchant portfolio equity 

table of contents we consider a salesperson to be vested once they have established merchant relationships that generate the equivalent of  of monthly gross margin 
vested status entitles the salesperson to his or her residual commissions for as long as the merchant processes with us  even if the salesperson is no longer employed by us 
the accrued buyout liability is based on the merchants we have under contract at the balance sheet date  the gross margin we generated from those accounts in the prior twelve months  the owned commission rate  and the fixed buyout multiple of times the commissions 
a small portion of our accrued buyout liability  less than  relates to salespersons who have opted to receive a multiple of times commissions in exchange for a larger company contribution towards health insurance 
the liability related to a new merchant is therefore zero when the merchant is installed  and increases over the twelve months following the installation date 
for unvested salespersons  the accrued buyout liability is accrued over the expected vesting period  however  no deferred acquisition cost is capitalized as future services are required in order to vest 
in calculating the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons  we have assumed that of unvested salespersons will vest in the future  which represents our historical vesting rate 
a increase to in the expected vesting rate would have increased the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons by million at december  and  respectively 
buyout payments made to salespersons reduce the outstanding accrued buyout liability 
given our view of the duration of the cash flows associated with a pool of merchant contracts  we believe that the benefits of such buyouts significantly exceed the cost  which typically represents years of commissions 
if the cash flows associated with a pool of bought out contracts does not exceed this cost  we will incur an economic loss on our decision to buyout the contracts 
during   and  we made buyout payments of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we exercised our rights to buy out a substantial amount of portfolio equity owned by our relationship managers and sales managers 
as a result of these buyouts  we reduced our accrued buyout liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet by the approximately million of cash payments we made 
the amount of future annual reductions in residual commission expense will be impacted by merchant attrition 
we expect to make significant buyout payments in the future  subject to available cash  as such buyouts reduce the monthly payments we will have to make to our salespersons for such merchants in the future 
processing liabilities processing liabilities result primarily from our card processing activities and include merchant deposits maintained to offset potential liabilities from merchant chargeback processing 
prior to december   processing liabilities also included funds in transit for express funds  our remote deposit capture product which was discontinued 
at december  and  processing liabilities totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the end of day presentment of transaction funding files to the bankcard networks  resulting in our sponsor banks receiving settlement cash one day earlier and increasing our funding obligations to our sme merchants  which we carry in processing liabilities 
disputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  the cardholder dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant favor 
in these cases  the transaction is charged back to the merchant  which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer by the card issuing bank and charged to the merchant 
if the merchant is unable to fund the refund  we must do so 
we also bear the risk of reject losses arising from the fact that we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period 
if the merchant has gone out of business during such period  we may be unable to collect such fees 
we maintain cash deposits or require the pledge of a letter of credit from certain merchants  generally those with higher average transaction size where the card is not present when the charge is made or the product or service is delivered after the charge is made  in order to offset potential contingent liabilities such as chargebacks and reject losses that would arise if the merchant went out of business 
at december  and  we held sme merchant deposits totaling million and million  respectively 
most chargeback and reject losses are charged to processing and servicing as they are incurred 
however  we also maintain a loss reserve against losses including major fraud losses  which are both less predictable and involve larger amounts 
the loss reserve was established using historical loss rates  applied to recent bankcard processing volume 
at december  and  our loss reserve totaled million  respectively 
aggregate sme bankcard merchant losses  including losses charged to operations and the loss reserve  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and during the fourth quarter of  we converted network services settled transactions from a third party processor 
table of contents and began settling network services merchant accounts  and processing chargebacks originating from these merchants  on passport 
prior to this  these chargebacks were processed and carried by a third party outsourced processor for settling network services merchant accounts 
chargeback losses originating from network services bankcard processing on passport during the year ended december  was immaterial 
share based compensation we expense employee share based payments under the fair value method 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we estimate the grant date fair value of the stock options we issue using a black scholes valuation model for plain vanilla stock options and performance based stock options  and we use a lattice valuation model to measure grant date fair value for stock options containing market vesting conditions 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on our historical volatility data related to market trading of our own common stock 
we base our assumptions for the expected life of new stock option grants on our analysis of the historical exercise patterns of our stock options 
our dividend yield assumption is based on dividends expected to be paid over the expected life of the stock option 
our risk free interest rate assumption for stock options granted is determined by using us treasury rates of the same period as the expected option term of each stock option 
the weighted average fair value of options we granted during  and were  and  respectively 
the fair value of options granted during  and was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  expected volatility expected life years years years expected dividends risk free interest rate in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved grants of  performance based restricted share units 
these restricted share units are nonvested share awards which would vest as follows will vest in  since the pro forma diluted earnings per share target of was achieved  and would in and in if over the term of these restricted share units  the following diluted earnings per share targets for the years ended december  and are achieved diluted earnings per share a a calculated on a pro forma basis to exclude non operating gains and losses  if any  and excluding the after tax impact of share based compensation expense

amounts we recognized in our financial statements during the years ended december   and with respect to share based compensation plans were as follows in thousands year ended december  compensation expense recognized on share based plans before income tax benefit related income tax benefit recognized in the income statement cash received from stock option exercises excess tax benefit recorded for tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options tax benefit realized as reductions of estimated tax payments during the period goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair values of net assets acquired in business combinations 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator or change in circumstances relating to impairment has occurred 
such changes may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and slower growth rates 
we perform annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
our evaluation indicated that no impairment existed as of december  or the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of each reporting unit as of december  and at december  and  goodwill of million and million  respectively  was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such indicators constitute a triggering event in other than the quarter in which the annual goodwill impairment test is 
table of contents performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the effects of differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
judgments are required in determining the amount and probability of future taxable income  which in turn is critical to a determination of whether a valuation reserve against the deferred tax asset is appropriate 
we also account for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 
this requires evaluations of individual tax positions to determine whether any part of that position can be recognized or continues to be recognized in the financial statements 
an uncertain tax position exists if it is unclear how a transaction will be treated under tax law 
we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december   approximately million of which would impact the effective tax rate

campus solutions includes revenue associated with our december  acquisition of ecsi from the date of acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sme card processing revenue 
our gross sme bankcard processing revenues for the year ended december  reflect a decline as compared to the year ended december  due to the impact of the durbin amendment 
the durbin amendment places limits on debit card interchange rates that card issuing banks may charge 
while not impacting our net revenue which we present net of interchange  dues and assessments and fees as discussed below in net revenue  beginning in the fourth quarter of  there was a decrease in the amount of sme interchange expense we record in our income statement as a result of the durbin amendment 
since our gross sme card processing revenues include the interchange that we pass through to our merchants  our total revenues decreased by an equivalent amount 
we estimate that the amount of this decrease on our gross sme merchant card processing revenues for the year ended december  was a reduction of approximately million 
partially offsetting the impact that the durbin amendment had on our gross revenues from sme card processing was the increase in revenue attributable to higher sme bankcard processing volume 
for the year ended december   our sme bankcard processing volume increased to billion  compared to billion for the year ended december   reflecting increases for same store sales growth  new sme merchants installed  and decreased sme merchant volume attrition 
network services increased its card processing revenues based on the million transactions it settled  representing billion in processing volume  and the billion transactions it authorized through its front end card processing systems in  as compared to the million transactions it settled  representing billion in processing volume  and the billion transactions it authorized through its front end card processing systems in network services increase for the period primarily reflects the expansion of a contract with a large petroleum merchant to include back end settlement 
we report network services settled bankcard processing revenues net of credit interchange because the daily cash settlement with network services merchants is on a net basis 
however  the durbin amendment did impact network services settled pin debit interchange by approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents contributing growth to our processing revenues for the year ended december  were the processing revenues generated by heartland school solutions  prepaid card income including heartland marketing solutions and campus solutions income

at december   our customer base included  k to schools  compared to approximately  k to schools at december  of those  approximately  and  schools at december  and  respectively  were using our online prepayment system 
payroll processing revenues 
payroll processing revenues  which include fees earned on payroll processing services and interest income earned on funds held for customers  increased by  from million in to million in  primarily due to price increases for at least half of our payroll processing customers and a increase in the number of payroll processing customers from  at december  to  at december  equipment related revenue 
equipment related revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to sales of equipment in our acquired heartland school solutions business 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in revenues from the sale of card processing terminals  including our proprietary encryption terminals  referred to as e terminals

table of contents total expenses 
total expenses increased from million in to million in  due to increases in general and administrative  processing and servicing  and depreciation and amortization expenses 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in customer acquisition costs 
total expenses represented of total net revenue in  compared to in processing and servicing expense for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase in processing and servicing expense was due to increased costs associated with processing and servicing higher sme bankcard processing volume  increased residual commission expense and increased cost of sales and servicing related to higher heartland school solutions revenues 
the increase in processing and servicing expense also reflects refined allocations of certain information technology related expenses  previously reported in general and administrative expense  to processing and servicing in the year ended december  partially offsetting the increases in processing and servicing expense were decreases in merchant losses  service center expense and card related equipment costs 
as a percentage of total net revenue  processing and servicing expense decreased to for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  customer acquisition costs for the year ended december  decreased by million  or compared with the year ended december  this decline primarily reflects the impacts of lower signing bonus amortization  as capitalized signing bonuses recorded in periods having higher new gross margin installs have become fully amortized

most of our investments in information technology have been for security related enhancements and in support of the continuing development of our processing platforms 
depreciation and amortization expense recorded on these investments is included in processing and servicing expense 
additionally  we capitalized salaries  fringe benefits and other expenses incurred by our employees that worked on internally developed software projects and we capitalized some outsourced programming expenses as well 
amortization does not begin on the internally developed software until the project is complete and placed in service  at which time we begin to amortize the asset over expected lives of three to seven years 
the amount capitalized increased from million in to million in the total amount of capitalized costs for projects placed in service in and was million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an million increase in personnel costs  including a million increase for share based compensation and increased personnel costs related to the heartland school solutions acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  benefited from refined allocations of certain information technology related expenses  previously reported in general and administrative expense  now recorded in processing and servicing expense 
offsetting this benefit was the increase in personnel costs which included additional personnel costs relating to the acquisition of the heartland school solutions businesses and an increase in share based compensation expense

provision for processing system intrusion costs 
on january   we publicly announced the discovery of a criminal breach of our payment systems environment the processing system intrusion 
the processing system intrusion involved malicious software that appears to have been used to collect in transit  unencrypted payment card data while it was being processed during the transaction authorization process 
we believe the breach did not extend beyond since our announcement of the processing system intrusion on january  and through december   we have expensed a total of million  before reducing those charges by million of total insurance recoveries

our receivables  which increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december   are primarily due from our bankcard processing merchants and result in large part from our practice of advancing interchange fees to most of our sme merchants during the month and collecting those fees from our merchants at the beginning of the following month  as well as from transaction fees we charge merchants for processing transactions 
historically  we funded these interchange advances to our sme merchants first with our available cash  then when that cash had been expended  by directing our sponsor banks to fund advances thereby incurring a payable to our sponsor banks

if the merchant incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card issuing bank  we must do so 
as the majority of our sme transactions involve the delivery of the product or service at the time of the transaction  a good basis to estimate our exposure to chargebacks is the last four months bankcard processing volume on our sme portfolio  which was billion for the four months ended december  and billion for the four months ended december  however  during the four months ended december  and december   we were presented with million and million  respectively  of chargebacks by issuing banks

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we have interest rate risk related to our payable to our sponsor banks 
within our amount payable to our sponsor banks are balances which our sponsor banks have advanced to our sme merchants for interchange fees 
historically  these advances to our sme merchants were funded first with our available cash  then by incurring a payable to our sponsor banks when that cash has been expended 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  these merchant advances are first funded from settlement cash received from bankcard networks when receipt of that settlement cash precedes the funding obligation to the sme merchant 
at december   our payable to sponsor banks included million for funding interchange advances to our sme merchants 
this payable is repaid on the first business day of the following month out of fees collected from our merchants 
during the quarter ended december  the average daily interest bearing balance of that payable was approximately million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our average payable to sponsor banks would result in a change of approximately  in annual pre tax income

these interest rate swaps convert that initial notional amount to a fixed rate 
at december   the remaining notional amount of these interest rate swaps was million 
the impact which a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would have on our outstanding december  balances under the credit agreement would be a decline of approximately million in annual pre tax income  including the effect from interest rate swaps 
while the bulk of our cash and cash equivalents are held in checking accounts or money market funds  we do hold certain fixed income investments with maturities within three years 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an increase of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market fund holdings  but a decrease in the value of fixed rate investments of approximately  a hypothetical basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market funds  but an increase in the value of fixed rate instruments of approximately  foreign currency risk
