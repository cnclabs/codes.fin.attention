certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  referred to as gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue and expenses 
the significant accounting policies that require us to make estimates and assumptions that are difficult  subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods are accounting for fair value measurements  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
these significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these significant accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
certain financial information presented in this management discussion and analysis is prepared on both a gaap  or reported basis  and a non gaap  or operating basis 
we measure and compare certain financial information on an operating basis  as we believe that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to state street normal ongoing business operations 
we believe that operating basis financial information  which reports non taxable revenue  such as interest revenue associated with tax exempt investment securities  on a fully taxable equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of our business  facilitates an investor understanding and analysis of state street underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in conformity with gaap

securities finance revenue for increased as a result of higher spreads across all lending programs  partly offset by lower lending volumes 
net interest revenue for increased compared to the overall increase generally resulted from higher levels of interest earning assets  mainly related to our investment of higher levels of excess client deposits primarily with the federal reserve and the european central bank  or ecb  growth in the investment portfolio  as we purchased additional securities  and lower funding costs 
these increases were partly offset by the impact of generally lower rates on interest earning assets 
net interest revenue for and included million and million  respectively  of discount accretion related to investment securities added to our consolidated statement of condition in connection with our asset backed commercial paper conduit consolidation 
net interest margin  calculated on fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue  declined basis points to in from in the investment of excess client deposits  amid continued market uncertainty  increased our average interest earning assets and our net interest revenue  but negatively affected our net interest margin  as we generally placed such deposits with central banks  and as a result earned the relatively low interest rates paid by the central banks on these balances

as presented in the foregoing overview of financial results table  our total expenses declined from the expenses reflected the aforementioned benefit of million related to settlements of claims against the lehman brothers estate in connection with our resolution of the indemnified repurchase and securities lending claims in the us and the us this benefit was mostly offset by aggregate acquisition and restructuring costs of million and provisions for litigation exposure and other costs of million 
these provisions were mainly related to previously disclosed litigation associated with asset management and securities lending 
the expenses included aggregate acquisition and restructuring costs of million 
compensation and employee benefits expenses were relatively flat in compared to  as costs associated with merit increases and acquisitions in were almost completely offset by the savings associated with the execution of our business operations and information technology transformation program

consolidated results of operations this section discusses our consolidated results of operations for compared to  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under item of this form k

fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by trading services  securities finance and processing fees and other revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from client deposits and short term investment activities by providing deposit 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper  to meet clients needs for high grade liquid investments  and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate 
fee revenue servicing and management fees collectively composed approximately of our total fee revenue for and for the level of these fees is influenced by several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and administration and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  and the types of products and services used by clients  and is generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income security valuations 
generally  servicing fees are affected  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody and administration 
additional factors  such as the relative mix of assets serviced  the level of transaction volumes  changes in service level  the nature of services provided  balance credits  client minimum balances  pricing concessions and other factors  may have a significant effect on our servicing fee revenue 
generally  management fees are affected  in part  by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
management fee revenue is relatively more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue  since a higher proportion of the underlying services provided  and the associated management fees earned  are dependent on equity and fixed income values 
additional factors  such as the relative mix of assets managed  changes in service level and other factors  may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue 
while certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed  management fees reflect other factors as well  including our relationship pricing for clients using multiple services 
management fees for actively managed products are generally earned at higher rates than those for passive products 
actively managed products may also involve performance fee arrangements 
performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements 
generally  we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees 
in light of the above  we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security valuations were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue

we are an alternative asset servicing provider worldwide  servicing hedge  private equity and real estate funds 
as of december   we had approximately trillion of alternative assets under administration 
the increase in servicing fees compared to primarily resulted from the impact of stronger equity markets  the impact of net new business installed on current year revenue  and the addition of revenue from acquired businesses  primarily gsas 
these factors were largely offset by the impacts of the weaker euro and de risking by clients  as they remained conservative in their investment allocations 
the combined daily averages of equity market valuations  individually presented in the foregoing index table  were up an average of approximately compared to for both and  servicing fees generated outside the us were approximately of total servicing fees

trading services the following table summarizes the components of trading services revenue for the years ended december years ended december  change dollars in millions foreign exchange trading direct sales and trading indirect foreign exchange trading total foreign exchange trading brokerage and other trading services electronic foreign exchange trading other trading  transition management and brokerage total brokerage and other trading services total trading services revenue trading services revenue includes revenue from foreign exchange trading  as well as revenue from brokerage and other trading services 
we earn foreign exchange trading revenue by acting as a principal market maker 
we offer a range of foreign exchange  or fx  products  services and execution models 
most of our fx products and execution services can be grouped into three broad categories  which are further explained below direct sales and trading fx  indirect fx and electronic foreign exchange trading 
with respect to electronic foreign exchange trading  we provide an execution venue but do not act as agent or principal 
we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community  including transition management  commission recapture and self directed brokerage 
these products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor 
revenue earned from these brokerage and other trading products is recorded in other trading  transition management and brokerage within brokerage and other trading services revenue 
foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors the volume and type of client fx transactions  currency volatility  and the management of currency and rate market risks 
revenue earned from direct sales and trading fx and indirect fx is recorded in foreign exchange trading revenue 
revenue earned from electronic foreign exchange trading is recorded in brokerage and other trading services revenue 
the decline in trading services revenue compared to  composed of separate changes related to fx trading and brokerage and other trading services  is explained below 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total fx trading revenue declined compared to the decline was primarily the result of declines in currency volatility and spreads  partly offset by higher client volumes 
this revenue was also affected by changes in mix between direct and indirect fx trading activities 
we enter into fx transactions with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly 
these trades are all executed at negotiated rates 
we refer to this activity  and our principal market making activities  as direct sales and trading fx 
alternatively  clients or their investment managers may elect to route fx transactions to our fx desk through our asset servicing operation  we refer to this activity as indirect fx 
we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients 
we calculate revenue for indirect fx using an attribution methodology based on estimated effective mark ups downs and observed client volumes 
for and  our estimated indirect fx revenue declined  mainly the result of lower volatility  a decline in client volumes and lower spreads 
all other fx revenue  other than this indirect fx revenue estimate  is estimated and considered by us to be direct sales and trading fx revenue 
for and  our estimated direct sales and trading fx revenue also declined  mainly the result of lower spreads  partly offset by higher client volumes 
declines in volatility also contributed to the decline in direct sales and trading fx revenue 
during  some of our clients who relied on our indirect model to execute their fx transactions transitioned to other methods to conduct their fx transactions 
through state street global markets  a unit of our investment servicing line of business  clients can transition to either direct sales and trading fx execution  including our street fx service that enables our clients to define their fx execution strategy and automate the foreign exchange trade execution process  in which state street continues to act as a principal market maker  or to one of our electronic trading platforms 
the decline in indirect fx revenue in compared to was partly attributable to this shift 
we continue to expect that some clients may choose  over time  to reduce their level of indirect foreign exchange transactions in favor of other execution methods  including either direct foreign exchange transactions or electronic foreign exchange trading  which we provide 
to the extent that clients shift to other execution methods that we provide  our foreign exchange trading revenue may decrease  even if volumes remain consistent 
total brokerage and other trading services revenue declined compared to our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms 
this service generates revenue through a click fee 
for the years ended december  and  our revenue from electronic fx trading platforms declined  primarily the result of a decline in client volumes 
our revenue from transition management  recorded in brokerage and other trading services revenue  and related expenses in and were adversely affected by compliance issues in our uk business  the reputational and regulatory impact of which may continue to adversely affect our transition management revenue in future periods 
securities finance our agency securities finance business consists of two principal components investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives which are managed by ssga and engage in agency securities lending  which we refer to as the ssga lending funds  and an agency lending program for third party investment managers and asset owners  which we refer to as the agency lending funds 
our securities finance business provides liquidity to the financial markets  as well as an effective means for clients to earn incremental revenue on their securities portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity to clients worldwide 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair value of the loaned securities 
as the fair value of the loaned securities changes  additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower 
such movements are typically referred to as daily mark to market collateral adjustments 
we also participate in securities lending transactions as a principal 
as principal  we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower  either a state street client or a broker dealer 
our involvement as principal is utilized when the lending client is unable to  or elects not to  transact directly with the market and requires us to execute the transaction and furnish the securities 
in our role as principal  we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating  and we have the ability to source securities through our assets under custody and administration 
for cash collateral  our clients pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and we invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts as directed by the owner of the loaned securities 
in some cases  the investment vehicles or managed accounts may be managed by ssga 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued securities finance revenue  composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non cash collateral  is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral 
the increase in securities finance revenue from to was substantially the result of higher spreads across all lending programs  partly offset by a decline in average lending volumes in the same comparison 
average spreads increased for compared to  and securities on loan averaged approximately billion for compared to approximately billion for market influences may continue to affect our revenue from  and the profitability of  our securities lending activities in future periods 
in addition  proposed or anticipated regulatory changes may affect the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue in future periods 
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue  including fees from our structured products business  fees from software licensing and maintenance  equity income from our joint venture investments  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets  and amortization of our investments in tax advantaged investments 
processing fees and other revenue declined from to the decline was mainly due to the negative impacts of higher amortization expense associated with an increase in tax advantaged investments in renewable energy and lower revenue from joint ventures 
the declines were partly offset by the absence of the negative fair value adjustments recorded in related to positions in the fixed income trading initiative  from which we withdrew beginning in the fourth quarter of the negative impact of the amortization expense on processing fees and other revenue is generally more than offset by the tax credits generated by the underlying investments  which are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense 
net interest revenue net interest revenue is defined as total interest revenue earned on interest earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets  which principally consist of investment securities  interest bearing deposits with banks  repurchase agreements  loans and leases and other liquid assets  are financed primarily by client deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt 
net interest margin represents the relationship between fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue and average total interest earning assets for the period 
revenue that is exempt from income taxes  mainly that earned from certain investment securities state and political subdivisions  is adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal statutory income tax rate of  adjusted for applicable state income taxes  net of the related federal tax benefit

during the past year  our clients have placed additional deposits with us amid market and public concerns related to various economic events 
the increases in average interest bearing deposits with banks resulted from the placement of additional client deposits with various central banks globally  primarily the federal reserve and the ecb 
although the investment of these client deposits increased our average interest earning assets and our net interest revenue  it negatively affected our net interest margin  as these placements generate only marginal  and in some cases zero percent  returns 
the investment securities portfolio grew as we took advantage of market opportunities  primarily in the first half of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued securities purchased under resale agreements increased to meet client liquidity needs  as eligible collateral in our portfolio of us treasury securities was reduced 
increased levels of cash collateral provided in connection with our role as principal in certain securities finance activities drove other earning assets higher 
while these activities support our overall profitability  they put downward pressure on our net interest margin 
net interest revenue on a gaap basis increased  and on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased  compared to the increases were primarily driven by the impacts of higher levels of interest earning assets  mainly the result of higher levels of client deposits invested with the federal reserve  the ecb and other non us central banks  the growth in the investment portfolio more fully described below  and lower funding costs 
these increases were generally offset by the impact of lower non us interest rates and the decline in fixed rate portfolio yields on interest earning assets 
subsequent to the previously disclosed commercial paper conduit consolidation  we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue of billion million in  million in  million in and million in 
the timing and ultimate recognition of any applicable discount accretion depends  in part  on factors that are outside of our control  including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality 
the impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions 
the timing and recognition of any applicable discount accretion can also be influenced by our ongoing management of the risks and other characteristics associated with our investment securities portfolio  including sales of securities which would otherwise generate accretion 
depending on the factors discussed above  among others  we anticipate that  until the former conduit securities remaining in our investment portfolio mature or are sold  discount accretion will continue to contribute to our net interest revenue 
assuming that we hold the remaining former conduit securities to maturity  all else being equal  we expect the remaining former conduit securities carried in our investment portfolio as of december  to generate aggregate discount accretion in future periods of approximately million over their remaining terms  with approximately half of this aggregate discount accretion to be recorded over the next four years 
changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below 
additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this form k 
interest bearing deposits with banks  which include cash balances maintained at the federal reserve  the ecb and other non us central banks to satisfy reserve requirements  averaged billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the placement of higher levels of excess client deposits 
average aggregate excess deposits approximated billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
given the expiration of the fdic transaction account guarantee  or tag  effective december   and absent any significant uncertainty related to issues associated with the federal debt ceiling  we expect to invest future excess client deposits in either highly liquid money market assets  including central bank deposits  or in investment securities  depending on our assessment of the characteristics of the deposits 
consequently  in future periods  to the extent that we invest such deposits in investment securities  we may no longer characterize certain client deposits as excess 
average securities purchased under resale agreements increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  average trading account assets declined from billion for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   the result of our withdrawal from our fixed income trading initiative beginning in the fourth quarter of our average investment securities portfolio increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  the increase was generally the result of ongoing purchases of securities  partly offset by maturities  prepayments and sales 
during  we purchased approximately billion of portfolio securities  including us treasury securities  mortgage and asset backed and agency mortgage backed securities  and non us government securities 
as of december   securities rated aaa and aa represented approximately of our portfolio  consistent with such composition as of december  loans and leases averaged billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  the decline was mainly related to lower levels of client demand for short duration liquidity  as well as declines in leveraged leases and purchased receivables  mainly from maturities and pay downs 
for both and  approximately of our average loan and lease portfolio was composed of short duration advances that provided liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities related to securities settlement 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table presents average us and us short duration advances for the years indicated years ended december  in millions average us short duration advances average non us short duration advances average total short duration advances for the year ended december   the decrease in average total short duration advances compared to was mainly the result of non us clients currently holding higher levels of liquidity  as well as the impact of foreign currency translation on non us advances 
average other interest earning assets increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  the increased levels were primarily the result of higher cash collateral provided in connection with our role as principal in certain securities finance activities 
aggregate average interest bearing deposits increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  this increase mainly reflected higher levels of wholesale certificates of deposit issued in connection with our management of liquidity refer to our discussion of liquidity management under financial condition liquidity in this management discussion and analysis  as well as higher levels of non us transaction accounts associated with new and existing business in assets under custody and administration 
although there has been a modest decline in deposits as a result of the expiration of the fdic tag  future deposit levels will be influenced by anticipated growth in the underlying asset servicing business  as well as market conditions  including the general levels of us and us interest rates 
average other short term borrowings declined to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december   as higher levels of client deposits provided additional liquidity 
average long term debt decreased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  the decrease primarily reflected the maturities of billion of senior notes in september and billion of senior notes in april  all previously issued by state street bank under the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program 
additional information about our long term debt is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
average other interest bearing liabilities increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of higher levels of client cash collateral received in connection with our role as principal in certain securities finance activities 
several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin  including the mix of client liabilities  actions of the various central banks  changes in us and us interest rates  the various yield curves around the world  the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio  and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured 
based on market conditions and other factors  we continue to re invest the proceeds from pay downs and maturities of securities in highly rated investment securities  such as us treasuries and agencies  federal agency mortgage backed securities and us and non us mortgage and asset backed securities 
the pace at which we continue to re invest and the types of securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time 
these factors and the level of interest rates worldwide are expected to dictate what effect our re investment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin 
in addition  in a prolonged period of low interest rates and low spreads  certain products that we offer  including deposit services  cash funds and securities finance  may be less attractive to our clients  and any resulting declines in assets invested in such products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and our liquidity management

in addition  compensation and employee benefits expenses included approximately million of costs related to our implementation of the program in  compared to approximately million of such costs in  which costs are not expected to recur subsequent to full implementation of the program 
information systems and communications expenses increased in compared to although the overall effect of the business operations and information technology transformation program was a reduction of our total expenses in compared to our total expenses from operations  and excluding increases due to other factors  the increase in information systems and communications expenses primarily resulted from the impact of our implementation of the program  as we expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support 
also contributing to the increase in compared to were additional costs incurred to support business growth 
transaction processing services expenses  which are volume related and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement  sub custodian services and external contract services  declined primarily as a result of lower sub custodian and external contract services costs related to declines in transaction volumes in trading services and our withdrawal from the fixed income trading initiative

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued brothers entities 
the various claims and amounts owed arose from transactions that existed at the time lehman brothers entered bankruptcy  including foreign exchange transactions  securities lending arrangements and repurchase agreements 
in  we reached an agreement with certain lehman brothers estates in the us to resolve the value of deficiency claims arising out of indemnified repurchase transactions in the us  and the bankruptcy court allowed those claims in the amount of million 
in  we received two distributions totaling million 
in september  we reached an agreement to settle the claims against the lehman brothers estate in the uk related to the close out of securities lending and repurchase arrangements 
this settlement resulted in a return obligation for us and a certified claim against the lehman brothers estate  and resolved the contingent nature of our rights and obligations with the lehman brothers estate 
in connection with our resolution of the indemnified repurchase and securities lending claims in the us and the us  we recognized a benefit of approximately million in our consolidated statement of income in both certified claims retained as part of the settlement agreements were subsequently sold at their respective fair values  resulting in an additional gain of approximately million  which was also recorded in our consolidated statement of income in acquisition costs in  we incurred acquisition costs of million  mainly related to integration costs incurred in connection with the gsas acquisition and our acquisition of the intesa securities services business  or intesa acquisition 
these acquisition costs were offset by an indemnification benefit of million for the assumption of an income tax liability related to the intesa acquisition 
the acquisition costs of million incurred in were composed of integration costs primarily associated with the bank of ireland asset management  intesa and mourant international finance administration acquisitions 
these acquisition costs were offset by an indemnification benefit of million for the assumption of an income tax liability related to the intesa acquisition

information with respect to these initiatives the business operations and information technology transformation program and the and expense control measures  including charges  staff reductions and aggregate activity in the related accruals  is provided in the two sections that follow 
business operations and information technology transformation program in november  we announced a global multi year business operations and information technology transformation program 
the program includes operational  information technology and targeted cost initiatives  including plans related to reductions in both staff and occupancy costs 
with respect to our business operations  we are standardizing certain core business processes  primarily through our execution of the state street lean methodology  and driving automation of these business processes 
we are currently creating a new technology platform  including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud  and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support 
we expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in and to implement this program  we expect to incur aggregate pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million to million over the four year period ending december  to date  we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of million in our consolidated statement of income  composed of million in  million in and million in the following table presents the charges by type of cost 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in millions employee related costs real estate consolidation information technology costs total total the employee related costs included costs related to severance  benefits and outplacement services 
real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties 
information technology costs included transition fees related to the above described expansion of our use of service providers 
in  in connection with the program  we initiated the involuntary termination of  employees  or approximately of our global workforce  which was substantially complete at the end of in addition  in  in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support  we identified employees to be involuntarily terminated as their roles were eliminated 
in  an additional positions were identified for elimination 
as of december   in connection with the planned aggregate staff reduction of  employees described above   of such identified employees had been involuntarily terminated  composed of employees in  employees in and employees in in connection with the implementation of the program  we achieved approximately million of pre tax expense savings in compared to our total expenses from operations 
in  we achieved additional pre tax expense savings of approximately million compared to the same expense base 
as of december   we have achieved cumulative pre tax expense savings of approximately million since the program inception in incremental pre tax expense savings in are forecasted to be approximately million 
excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of million to million described earlier  we expect the program to reduce our pre tax expenses from operations  on an annualized basis  by approximately million to million by the end of compared to  all else being equal  with the full effect realized in we expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in approximately million of these savings  with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of in addition  we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in approximately million of these savings 
these pre tax savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program and are based on projected improvement from our total expenses from operations 
our actual total expenses have increased since  and may in the future increase or decrease  due to other factors 
the majority of the annual savings will affect compensation and employee benefits expenses 
these savings will be modestly offset by increases in information systems and communications expenses as we implement the program 
expense control measures during the fourth quarter of  in connection with expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets facing businesses in  we took two actions 
first  we withdrew from our fixed income trading initiative  in which we traded in fixed income securities and derivatives as principal with our custody clients and other third parties that trade in these securities and derivatives 
second  we undertook other targeted staff reductions 
as a result of these actions  we recorded aggregate pre tax restructuring charges of million in  and a net credit adjustment of million in  in our consolidated statement of income 
the following table presents the charges by type of cost in millions employee related costs fixed income trading portfolio asset and other write offs total total the employee related costs included costs related to severance  benefits and outplacement services with respect to both aspects of the expense control measures 
in connection with these measures  we identified employees to be involuntarily terminated as their roles were eliminated 
as of december   employees had been involuntarily terminated  composed of employees in and employees in the costs related to the fixed income trading portfolio resulted primarily from fair value adjustments to the initiative trading portfolio related to our decision to withdraw from the initiative 
in connection with our withdrawal  during  we wound down that initiative remaining trading portfolio 
costs for asset and other write offs were related to asset write downs and contract terminations 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the fourth quarter of  specifically in connection with expense control measures designed to better align our expenses to our business strategy and related outlook for  we identified additional targeted staff reductions  and recorded aggregate pre tax restructuring charges of million in in our consolidated statement of income

the decline in total fee revenue generally resulted from declines in trading services and processing fees and other revenue  partly offset by increases in servicing fees and securities finance revenue 
trading services revenue decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decline in foreign exchange trading revenue associated with lower currency volatility and lower spreads  partly offset by higher client volumes 
processing fees and other revenue declined compared to  primarily the result of a higher level of amortization expense related to tax advantaged investments in renewable energy and lower revenue from joint ventures  partly offset by the absence of the negative fair value adjustments related to positions in the fixed income trading initiative that we recorded in as we withdrew from that business 
the increase in servicing fees primarily resulted from the impact of stronger equity markets  the impact of net new business installed on current year revenue  and the addition of revenue from acquisitions  primarily gsas 
these factors were offset by the impacts of the weaker euro and de risking by clients  as they remained conservative in their investment allocations

information systems and communications expenses were higher primarily as a result of higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software related to improvements in our investor technology and global infrastructure  as well as the expenses added from acquisitions  primarily the intesa acquisition 
transaction processing services expenses were higher compared to the prior year primarily as a result of higher levels of spending on external contract services  higher broker and sub custodian fees  and the inclusion of the expenses added by the intesa acquisition

the increase in the other costs component of aggregate other expenses was mainly the result of significant insurance recoveries received in these increases were offset slightly by a lower level of funding provided to our charitable foundation 
the insurance recoveries that reduced other expenses for  which totaled approximately million  were received with respect to settlement payments made by us to clients in prior periods in connection with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga prior to august we account for insurance recoveries as gains when payments for the recoveries are received

financial condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our investment servicing and investment management lines of business 
our clients needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume  mix and currency denomination 
as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they utilize short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our clients 
deposits and other liabilities generated by client activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities  although the weighted average maturities of our assets are significantly longer than the contractual maturities of our liabilities 
our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short duration financial instruments  such as interest bearing deposits and securities purchased under resale agreements 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets 
as our non us business activities have continued to grow  we have expanded our capabilities and processes to enable us to manage the liabilities generated by our core businesses and the related assets in which these liabilities are invested  in a manner that more closely aligns our businesses and related activities with the cash management  investment activities and other operations of our clients 
as a result  the structure of our statement of condition continues to evolve to reflect these efforts

we recorded no other than temporary impairment on these mortgage and asset backed securities in or the sovereign crisis in europe eased in the second half of  as the governments actions improved market sentiment  but with little sign of improvement in the peripheral countries economies  and declining economic performance in the strong european union economies 
throughout the sovereign crisis  the major independent credit rating agencies have downgraded  and may in the future do so again  us and us financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been  and may in the future be  significant counterparties to us  or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes 
as a result  we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk resulting from our role as principal  or because of commitments we make in our capacity as a financial intermediary 
refer to the risk factors titled we assume significant credit risk to counterparties  many of which are major financial institutions 
these financial institutions and other counterparties may also have substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions and sovereign entities 
this credit exposure and concentration could expose us to financial loss  and our business involves significant european operations  and disruptions in european economies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition  included under item a of this form k 
country risks with respect to spain  italy  ireland and portugal are identified  assessed and monitored by our country and counterparty exposure committee 
country limits are defined in our credit and counterparty risk guidelines  in accordance with our credit and counterparty risk policy 
these limits are monitored on a daily basis by enterprise risk management  or erm 
all of these country exposures are subject to ongoing surveillance and stress test analysis  conducted by the investment portfolio management team 
the stress tests performed reflect the structure and nature of the exposure  its past and likely future performance based on macroeconomic and environmental analysis  with key underlying assumptions varied under a range of scenarios  reflecting likely downward pressure on collateral performance 
the results of the stress tests are presented to senior management and erm as part of the surveillance process 
in addition  erm conducts independent stress test analyses and evaluates the structured asset exposures in these countries for the assessment of other than temporary impairment 
the assumptions used in these evaluations reflect expected downward pressure on collateral performance 
stress scenarios are subject to regular review  and are updated to reflect changes in the economic environment  measures taken in response to the sovereign crisis and collateral performance  with particular attention to these specific country exposures

refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
the decline in these remaining after tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from december  to december  resulted primarily from amortization 
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other than temporary impairment exists 
our assessment of other than temporary impairment involves an evaluation  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  of economic and security specific factors 
such factors are based on estimates  derived by management  which contemplate current market conditions and security specific performance 
to the extent that market conditions are worse than management expectations  other than temporary impairment could increase  in particular the credit related component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage and asset backed securities  to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks  the performance of the us housing market continues to be a significant driver of the portfolio credit performance 
as such  our assessment of other than temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices 
generally  indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears 
as of september   national housing prices  according to the case shiller national home price index  had declined by approximately peak to current 
overall  for purposes of its evaluation of other than temporary impairment as of december   management prospectively expects a us housing recovery characterized by relatively modest growth in national housing prices over the next few years 
in connection with our assessment of other than temporary impairment with respect to relevant securities in our investment portfolio in future fiscal periods  we will consider trends in national housing prices that we observe at those times  including then available information with respect to the case shiller national home price index 
our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to management estimates of future cumulative losses 
ultimately  other than temporary impairment is based on specific cusip level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security 
in addition  we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non agency us residential mortgage backed portfolio 
we estimate  for example  that if national housing prices were to decline by an additional to relative to september  levels  other than temporary impairment of our us investment portfolio could increase by a range of approximately million to million 
this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults 
to the extent that such factors differ significantly from management current expectations  resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated 
the residential mortgage servicing environment remains challenging  and the timeline to liquidate distressed loans continues to extend 
the rate at which distressed residential mortgages are liquidated may affect  among other things  our investment securities portfolio 
such effects could include the timing of cash flows or the credit quality associated with the mortgages collateralizing certain of our residential mortgage backed securities  which  accordingly  could result in the recognition of additional other than temporary impairment in future periods 
our evaluation of potential other than temporary impairment of mortgage backed securities with collateral located in spain  italy  ireland and portugal takes into account government intervention in the corresponding mortgage markets and assumes a negative baseline macroeconomic environment for this region  due to a combination of slower economic growth and government austerity measures 
our baseline view assumes a recessionary period characterized by higher unemployment and by additional declines in housing prices of between and across these four countries 
our evaluation of other than temporary impairment in our base case does not assume a disorderly sovereign debt restructuring or a break up of the eurozone 
in addition  we perform stress testing and sensitivity analysis in order to assess the impact of more severe assumptions on potential other than temporary impairment 
we estimate  for example  that in more stressful scenarios in which unemployment  gross domestic product and housing prices in these four countries deteriorate more than we expected as of december   other than temporary impairment could increase by a range of approximately million to million 
this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults 
to the extent that such factors differ significantly from management current expectations  resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated 
excluding other than temporary impairment recorded in  management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses as of december  to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities 
additional information about these net unrealized losses and our assessment of impairment is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k

the institutional segment is composed of the following classes investment funds  commercial and financial  purchased receivables and lease financing 
investment funds includes lending to mutual and other collective investment funds and short duration advances to fund clients to provide liquidity in support of their transaction flows associated with securities settlement activities 
commercial and financial includes lending to corporate borrowers  including broker dealers 
purchased receivables represents undivided interests in securitized pools of underlying third party receivables added in connection with the conduit consolidation 
lease financing includes our investment in leveraged lease financing 
aggregate short duration advances to our clients included in the investment funds and commercial and financial classes of the institutional segment were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  unearned income deducted from our investment in leveraged lease financing was million and million  respectively  for us leases and million and million  respectively  for non us leases 
the commercial real estate  or cre  segment is composed of the loans acquired in pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy 
these loans  which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate  were recorded at their then current fair value  based on management expectations with respect to future cash flows from the loans using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition 
as of december  and  we held an aggregate of approximately million and million  respectively  of cre loans which were modified in troubled debt restructurings 
no impairment loss was recognized upon restructuring of the loans  as the discounted cash flows of the modified loans exceeded the carrying amount of the original loans as of the modification date 
no loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings in or we define past due loans as loans on which contractual principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but for which interest continues to be accrued 
no institutional loans were days or more contractually past due as of december     or as of december   no cre loans were days or more contractually past due 
although a portion of the cre loans was days or more contractually past due as of december    and  we do not report them as past due loans  because in accordance with gaap  the interest earned on these loans is based on an accretable yield resulting from management s expectations with respect to the future cash flows for each loan relative to both the timing and collection of principal and interest as of the reporting date  not the loans contractual payment terms 
these cash flow estimates are updated quarterly to reflect changes in management s expectations  which consider market conditions 
we generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are days past due  or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
as of december   none of the aforementioned cre loans was on non accrual status 
as of december   approximately million of cre loans was on non accrual status  as the yield associated with these loans  determined when the loans were acquired  was deemed to be non accretable 
this determination was based on management expectations of the future collection of principal and interest from the loans

with respect to cre loans  management considers its expectations with respect to future cash flows from those loans and the value of available collateral 
these expectations are based  among other things  on an assessment of economic conditions  including conditions in the commercial real estate market and other factors

our cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks  loans and lease financing  including short duration advances  investment securities  amounts related to foreign exchange and interest rate contracts  and securities finance 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations 
we place deposits with non us counterparties that have strong internal state street risk ratings 
counterparties are approved and monitored by our country and counterparty exposure committee 
this process includes financial analysis of non us counterparties and the use of an internal risk rating system 
each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on deteriorating credit fundamentals or general market conditions 
we also utilize risk mitigation and other facilities that may reduce our exposure through the use of cash collateral and or balance sheet netting 
in addition  the country and counterparty exposure committee performs a country risk analysis and monitors limits on country exposure

regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term  while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our regulatory capital requirements  the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt and our capital position relative to our peers 
our asset  liability and capital committee  referred to as alcco  oversees the management of our regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for regulatory capital purposes is the federal reserve 
both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of state street bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company

aggregate net income and eligible comprehensive income was substantially offset by declarations of common stock dividends  purchases by us of our common stock  and goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of gsas 
the decrease in the tier leverage ratio mainly resulted from an increase in adjusted quarterly average assets associated with balance sheet growth during the year 
as of december   state street bank regulatory capital ratios declined compared to december   primarily the result of lower tier capital 
aggregate net income and eligible comprehensive income was more than offset by the payment of dividends to the parent company and the gsas goodwill

preferred stock in august  we issued and sold million depositary shares  each representing a  th ownership interest in a share of state street s non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series c  without par value  with a liquidation preference of  per share equivalent to per depositary share  in a public offering 
we issued  shares of series c preferred stock in connection with the depositary share offering 
the aggregate proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other issuance costs  were approximately million 
the series c preferred stock qualifies for inclusion in tier regulatory capital under federal regulatory capital guidelines 
additional information about the series c preferred stock is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
in october  we used the proceeds from the offering  together with cash on hand  to redeem all  outstanding shares of our non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  liquidation preference of  per share  for an aggregate payment of approximately million plus declared but unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock  issued in march  was held by state street capital trust iii  and constituted the principal asset of the trust 
following the redemption of the series a preferred stock  state street capital trust iii redeemed all of the outstanding fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities issued by the trust  referred to as normal apex  and all of the outstanding common securities of the trust  which common securities were held by us 
common stock in march  following our receipt of the results of the federal reserve board review of our capital plan  with respect to which the federal reserve did not object to the capital actions we proposed  we took two significant actions 
first  we declared a quarterly common stock dividend of per share  or approximately million  which was paid in april in all of  we declared quarterly common stock dividends totaling per share  or approximately million 
in  we declared quarterly common stock dividends totaling per share  or approximately million 
second  our board of directors approved a new common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase by us of up to billion of our common stock through march  this new program followed our common stock purchase program  under which we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million  all in in  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock  all under the march program  at an aggregate cost of billion 
shares acquired in connection with these purchase programs which remained unissued as of year end were recorded as treasury stock in our consolidated statement of condition as of december  and the federal reserve is currently conducting a review of capital plans for submitted by us and by other systemically important financial institutions in january  which capital plans include tests of our capital adequacy under various stress scenarios 
the levels at which we will be able to declare dividends and purchase shares of our common stock after march will depend on the federal reserve assessment of our capital plan and our projected performance under the stress scenarios 
while we anticipate that we will obtain federal reserve approval for the continued return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and or common stock purchases in  we cannot provide assurance with respect to the federal reserve assessment of our capital plan  or that we will be able to continue to return capital to our shareholders at any specific level 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company

information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in related stockholder matters included under item  and in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item  of this form k 
basel i  basel ii and basel iii the current generally applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements enforced by the us banking regulators are based on a international accord  commonly referred to as basel i  which was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision  or basel committee 
in  the basel committee released the final version of a new capital adequacy framework  referred to as basel ii 
basel ii governs the capital adequacy of large  internationally active banking organizations  such as state street  that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems  and requires these organizations to enhance their measurement and management of the risks underlying their business activities and to better align their regulatory capital requirements with those underlying risks 
basel ii adopts a three pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy and minimum capital requirements  which incorporates pillar  the measurement of credit risk  market risk and operational risk  pillar  supervisory review  which addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy relative to the risks underlying its business activities  rather than only with respect to its minimum regulatory capital requirements  and pillar  market discipline  which imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization intended to allow the assessment of key information about the organization risk profile and its associated level of regulatory capital 
in december  us banking regulators jointly issued final rules to implement the basel ii framework in the us the framework does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the us  and explicitly reserves the regulators authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate 
prior to full implementation of the basel ii framework  state street is required to complete a defined qualification period  during which it must demonstrate that it complies with the related regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of the federal reserve 
state street is currently in the qualification period for basel ii 
in  in response to the financial crisis and ongoing global financial market dynamics  the basel committee proposed new guidelines  referred to as basel iii 
basel iii would establish more stringent regulatory capital and liquidity requirements  including higher minimum regulatory capital ratios  new capital buffers  higher risk weighted asset calibrations  more restrictive definitions of qualifying capital  a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio 
basel iii  once adopted by us banking regulators  as well as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or dodd frank act  and the resulting regulations are expected to change the manner in which our regulatory capital ratios are calculated and increase the minimum regulatory capital that we will be required to maintain 
in june  us banking regulators jointly issued three concurrent notices of proposed rulemaking  or nprs  to implement the basel iii framework in the us these proposed rules revise both basel i as well as specific provisions of the basel ii based regulatory capital requirements and  together with relevant portions of the dodd frank act  restructure the us capital rules into a harmonized and comprehensive capital framework 
among other things  the proposals raise the minimum tier risk based capital ratio from to  add requirements for minimum common equity tier and supplemental tier leverage ratios  and implement a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer linked to a banking organization common equity tier capital levels 
we continue to review and evaluate these proposals  and currently await their finalization 
our current assessment of the implications of the above described basel iii nprs  the us banking regulators proposed implementation of these standards  and other international regulatory initiatives indicates a potential material impact on our businesses and our profitability  as well as on our regulatory capital ratios 
one significant provision in the nprs would require us to apply the simplified supervisory formula approach  referred to as the ssfa  in the risk weighting of asset securitization exposures  such as asset backed securities  carried in our investment securities portfolio 
the approach required by basel ii utilizes the ratings based approach  under which external credit ratings are used to risk weight such exposures 
the dodd frank act prohibits the use of external credit ratings in the risk weighting of asset securitization exposures 
currently  our investment portfolio contains significant holdings of mortgage and asset backed securities that are highly rated by credit rating agencies  but for which the ssfa would apply higher regulatory risk weights as compared to the approach required by basel i and previous basel iii proposals 
in contrast  certain of our securities with lower credit ratings would receive lower regulatory risk weights if the ssfa were applied 
based on the composition of our investment portfolio with respect to the types of securities and related external credit ratings as of december   if the proposals in the nprs were implemented as currently structured  our application of the ssfa would materially increase our total regulatory risk weighted assets relative to those calculated in conformity with basel i  and correspondingly decrease our regulatory risk based capital ratios relative to those calculated in conformity with basel i  as a result  we are re evaluating the composition of our investment portfolio in order to maintain an investment strategy 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued appropriately aligned with our maintenance of an appropriate level of regulatory capital 
depending on future market conditions  this re evaluation could result in the reinvestment of our portfolio securities into different types of investments  which could materially affect our consolidated results of operations 
certain of the proposals in the nprs  including the requirement to apply the ssfa  are not anticipated to be fully effective before  although they may be implemented  in whole or in part  earlier  with or without a phase in period 
as such  a significant number of the securities currently held in our investment portfolio that are highly rated by credit agencies are expected to mature or pay down over the intervening period  and we would currently anticipate replacing those securities pursuant to our re investment program in a manner that would seek to manage our risk appetite  our return objectives and our levels of regulatory capital 
as a result of our balance sheet management efforts  all else being equal  we would anticipate being able to significantly offset  in whole or in part  the impact of application of the ssfa on our total regulatory risk weighted assets and related regulatory risk based capital ratios 
until us banking regulators finalize new rules implementing basel iii and relevant provisions of the dodd frank act  determining with certainty the alignment of our regulatory capital and our operations with the us regulatory capital requirements  or when we will be expected to be compliant with such requirements  is not possible 
we believe  however  that we will be able to comply with the relevant basel ii and basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity requirements when and as applied to us 
we are currently designated as a large bank holding company subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards  commonly referred to as a systemically important financial institution  or sifi  and we are one among a group of institutions worldwide that have been identified by the financial stability board and the basel committee as global systemically important banks  or g sibs 
both of these designations will require us to hold incrementally higher regulatory capital compared to financial institutions without such designations 
economic capital we define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt  and obligations higher in priority  against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target aa aa senior bank debt rating 
economic capital requirements are one of several important measures used by management and the board of directors to assess the adequacy of our capital levels in relation to state street risk profile 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to periodically refine the methodologies  assumptions  and information used to estimate our economic capital requirements  such requirements could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities 
we have begun to measure returns on economic capital and economic profit defined by us as net income available to common shareholders after deduction of state street cost of equity capital by line of business 
this economic profit will be used by management and the board to gauge risk adjusted performance over time 
accordingly  the measurement and evaluation of risk adjusted performance have become integral parts of our internal process for allocating resources  eg  capital  information technology spending  etc  by line of business 
in addition  return on capital and economic profit are two of several measures used in our evaluation of the viability of a new business or product initiative and for merger and acquisition analysis 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities  interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition  credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty  operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events  which is consistent with the basel ii definition  and business risk the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of our business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks 
economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using scenario analysis and statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and  in some cases  external information 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to provide for the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our clients and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
significant uses of liquidity  described more fully below  consist primarily of funding client deposit withdrawals and outstanding commitments to extend credit or commitments to purchase securities as they are drawn upon 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by the asset structure in our consolidated statement of condition 
our global treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alcco 
management maintains a liquidity framework which assesses the sources and uses of liquidity 
monitoring of our liquidity position is conducted by global treasury and erm 
embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several areas of potential risk based on our activities  size  and other appropriate risk related factors 
we use liquidity metrics  early warning indicators and stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs 
these measures are a combination of internal and external events which assist us in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash  as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
another important component of our liquidity framework is a contingency funding plan  or cfp  that is designed to identify and manage state street through a potential liquidity crisis 
the cfp defines roles  responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions 
we generally manage our liquidity on a global basis at the state street consolidated level 
we also manage parent company liquidity  and in certain cases branch liquidity  separately 
state street bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve discount window 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
the parent company typically holds enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with its banking subsidiaries  to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs  as well as those projected over the next one year period 
the sources of our liquidity consist of two primary areas access to the global capital markets and liquid assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition 
our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would access to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below 
on balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy 
these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets  but more importantly  they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales 
in addition  state street bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston 
this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high quality collateral  which helps facilitate asset and liability management of depository institutions 
no federal home loan bank advances were outstanding as of december  or december  each of the above described sources of liquidity is used in our management of daily cash needs and is available in a crisis scenario should we need to accommodate potential large  unexpected demand for funds 
significant uses of our liquidity generally result from the following withdrawals of unsecured client deposits  draw downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities  generally provided through lines of credit  and short duration advance facilities 
client deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities  and are invested in a combination of investment securities and short duration financial instruments whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits 
most of the client deposits are payable on demand or are short term in nature  which characteristics mean that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts 
similarly  clients can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit  or can overdraw their deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as large draw downs of existing lines of credit  could require additional liquidity 
material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include  among other things  adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or our liquidity needs  and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities  which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our clients 
in managing our liquidity  we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit  or cds  and invested those funds in short duration financial instruments which are carried in our consolidated statement of condition and which would be available 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to meet our cash needs 
as of december   this wholesale cd portfolio totaled billion  compared to billion as of december  while maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  our on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control  and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral 
our net liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short duration liquid assets  such as interest bearing deposits with banks  which are multi currency instruments invested with major multi national banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly 
as of december   the value of our consolidated net liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion  compared to billion as of december  for the year ended december   consolidated average net liquid assets were billion compared to billion for the year ended december  due to the unusual size and volatile nature of client deposits as of year end  we maintained excess balances of approximately billion at the federal reserve  the ecb and other non us central banks as of december   compared to billion as of december  as of december   the value of the parent company net liquid assets totaled billion  compared with billion as of december  the parent company liquid assets consisted primarily of overnight placements with its banking subsidiaries 
aggregate investment securities carried at billion as of december  and billion as of december  were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation  unless pledged internally between state street affiliates 
liquid assets included securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston to secure state street bank ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise 
this access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for state street bank 
as of december   state street bank had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window 
based on our level of consolidated liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration  management considers state street overall liquidity as of december  to be sufficient to meet its current commitments and business needs  including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its clients 
as referenced above  our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global capital markets and client deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by increasing the potential market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates

risk management the global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function 
the identification  assessment  monitoring  mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return 
we have a disciplined approach to risk that involves all levels of management 
the board  through its risk and capital committee  provides extensive oversight and review of our overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street risk appetite statement  which is an integral part of our overall internal capital adequacy assessment process  or icaap 
the risk appetite statement outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define and constrain our risk appetite and defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits  which are reported regularly to the board 
in addition  state street utilizes a variety of key risk indicators to monitor risk on a more granular level 
erm  a corporate function  provides risk oversight  support and coordination to allow for consistent identification  measurement and management of risks across business units independent of the business units activities  and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  erm establishes and reviews approved limits and  in collaboration with business unit management  monitors key risks 
the chief risk officer  or cro  manages erm and reports to both the chief executive officer and the board risk and capital committee 
the execution of duties with respect to the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the function of risk management is designing and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards  and providing oversight of the business owned risks 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility between erm and the business units  and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 
in addition  corporate audit independently assesses the effectiveness of business units and risk management in the execution of their responsibilities 
responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees  as well as the board risk and capital committee 
the management risk and capital committee  or mrac  co chaired by our chief risk officer and chief financial officer  is the senior management decision making body for risk and capital issues  and is responsible for ensuring that state street strategy  budget  risk appetite and capital adequacy are properly aligned 
alcco  chaired by our treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated statement of condition  the management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions  our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure  and debt and equity issuances 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued state street risk management program is supported by the activities of a number of corporate risk oversight committees  chaired by senior executives within erm 
our fiduciary review committee reviews and assesses the risk management programs of those units in which state street serves in a fiduciary capacity 
our credit risk and policy committee is responsible for cross business unit review and oversight of credit and counterparty risk 
our credit committee is responsible for the review  recommendation and approval of material policies  procedures and guidelines governing the identification  measurement  analysis and control of material credit risk across state street 
our country and counterparty exposure committee oversees the identification  assessment  monitoring  reporting and mitigation  where necessary  of country risks 
our operational risk committee provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify  measure  manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
our model assessment committee provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates financial models utilized by our business units 
while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices 
state street is exposed to market risk in both its trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
the market risk management processes related to these activities  discussed in further detail below  apply to both on and off balance sheet exposures 
we engage in trading and investment activities primarily to support our clients needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall risk appetite  objectives and liquidity needs  our clients requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed under asset and liability management activities in this market risk section 
trading activities market risk associated with our foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines  including established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
we use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  or var  described later in this section  to measure  monitor and manage market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee 
we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are generally intended to generate trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility 
in addition  we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets 
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  our clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these client needs 
as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  and interest rate futures 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these derivative contracts was billion  of which billion was composed of foreign exchange forward  swap and spot contracts 
in the aggregate  positions are matched closely to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
additional information about derivative instruments  entered into in connection with our trading activities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
as noted above  we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies  including var  which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a risk measurement methodology to estimate var daily 
we have adopted standards for estimating var  and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk in accordance with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk guidelines 
var is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of two years 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated var more than of the time  or less than three business days out of a year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued exchange rates  us and us interest rates and implied volatilities  and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  our historical simulation var methodology is subject to inherent limitations and assumptions 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day 
therefore  implicit in the var estimate is the assumption that no intra day actions are taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not incorporate risk associated with intra day changes in positions or intra day price volatility 
in addition to daily var measurement  we regularly perform stress tests 
these stress tests consider historical events  such as the asian financial crisis or the most recent crisis in the financial markets  as well as hypothetical scenarios defined by us  such as parallel and non parallel changes in yield curves 
our var model incorporates exposures to more than  factors  composed of foreign exchange spot rates  interest rate base and spread curves and implied volatility levels and skews 
the following table presents var associated with our trading activities  for trading positions held during the periods indicated  as measured by our var methodology 
the generally lower total var amounts compared to component var amounts primarily relate to diversification benefits across risk types 
value at risk years ended december  in millions average maximum minimum average maximum minimum foreign exchange rates interest rates total var for trading assets the year over year decline in the var associated with interest rate risk was generally the result of the impact of our withdrawal from our fixed income trading initiative  which we announced in and completed in our historical simulation var methodology recognizes diversification benefits by fully revaluing our portfolio using historical market information 
as a result  this historical simulation better captures risk by incorporating  by construction  any diversification benefits or concentration risks in our portfolio related to market factors which have historically moved in correlated or independent directions and amounts 
consistent with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk guidelines  our var measurement includes certain positions held outside of our regular sales and trading activities  but recorded in trading account assets in our consolidated statement of condition and covered by those guidelines 
we do not have a historical simulation var model that covers positions held outside of our regular sales and trading activities 
consequently  we calculate the var associated with those assets using a separate model  which we then add to the var associated with our regular sales and trading activities to derive state street total regulatory var 
although this simple addition does not give full recognition to the benefits of diversification of our business  we believe that this approach is both conservative and consistent with the way in which we manage those businesses 
we perform ongoing integrity testing of our var models to validate that the model forecasts are reasonable when compared to actual results 
our actual daily trading profit and loss  or p l  is generally greater than the hypothetical daily trading p l due to our ability to manage our positions through intra day trading and other pricing considerations 
as such  while we have not observed any back testing exceptions to the var model in comparison to actual daily trading p l  from time to time  back testing exceptions do occur on a hypothetical basis  assuming that all positions are held constant 
these exceptions are generally infrequent  as one would expect from the nature and definition of a var computation 
the following table presents the var associated with our regular trading activities  presented in the preceding table  and the var associated with positions held outside of those trading activities  the latter of which is described as var for non trading assets  for the periods indicated 
total regulatory var is calculated as the sum of the var for trading assets and the var for non trading assets  with no additional diversification benefits recognized 
the average  maximum and minimum amounts are calculated for each line item separately 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total regulatory value at risk years ended december  in millions average maximum minimum average maximum minimum var for trading assets var for non trading assets total regulatory var asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
while many market factors affect the level of nir and the economic value of our assets and liabilities  one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses 
we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  including the currency composition of our significant non us dollar denominated client liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines 
our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alcco 
our global treasury group has responsibility for managing state street day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage our consolidated statement of condition and related nir  global treasury has the authority to assume a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units  north america  europe and asia pacific  to reflect the growing  global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position 
the economic value of our statement of condition is a metric designed to best estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities which could be garnered if the assets and liabilities were sold today 
the economic values represent discounted cash flows from all financial instruments  therefore  changes in the yield curves  which are used to discount the cash flows  affect the values of these instruments 
additional information about our measurement of fair value is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition  we use certain derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
our use of derivatives is subject to guidelines approved by alcco  within which we seek to manage 
additional information about our use of derivatives is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on nir and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible nir results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we use nir simulation  or nir at risk  and economic value of equity  or eve  sensitivity 
nir at risk measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and gradual  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates 
eve sensitivity is a total return view of interest rate risk  which measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates  and is generally used in the context of economic capital discussed under economic capital in financial condition capital in this management discussion and analysis 
although nir at risk and eve sensitivity measure interest rate risk over different time horizons  both utilize consistent assumptions when modeling the positions currently held by state street  however  nir at risk also incorporates future actions planned by management over the time horizons being modeled 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming our forecasted yield curve over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve months  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from borrowers prepayment opportunities 
key assumptions used in the models  described in more detail in each section below  along with changes in market conditions  are inherently uncertain 
actual results necessarily differ from model results as market conditions differ from assumptions 
as such  management performs back testing  stress testing  and model integrity analyses to validate that the modeled results produce predictive nir at risk and eve sensitivity estimates which can be used in the management of interest rate risk 
primary factors affecting the actual results are changes in balance sheet size and mix  the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates  including the slope and the relationship between the interest rate level of us dollar and non us dollar yield curves  changes in market conditions  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
both nir at risk and eve sensitivity results are managed against alcco approved limits and guidelines and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests  by both global treasury and alcco 
our alcco approved guidelines are  we believe  in line with industry standards and are periodically examined by the federal reserve 
based on our current balance sheet composition where fixed rate assets exceed fixed rate liabilities  reported results of nir at risk could depict an increase in nir from a rate increase while eve presents a loss 
a change in this balance sheet profile may result in different outcomes under both nir at risk and eve 
nir at risk depicts the change in the nominal undiscounted dollar net interest flows which are generated from the forecasted statement of condition over the next months 
as rates increase  the interest expense associated with our client deposit liabilities is assumed to increase at a slower pace than the investment returns derived from our current balance sheet or the associated reinvestment of our interest earning assets  resulting in an overall increase to nir 
eve  on the other hand  measures the present value change of both principal and interest cash flows based on the current period end balance sheet 
as a result  eve does not contemplate reinvestment of our assets associated with a change in the interest rate environment 
although net interest revenue in both nir at risk and eve is higher in response to increased interest rates  the future principal flows on fixed rate investments are discounted at higher rates for eve  which results in lower asset values and a corresponding reduction or loss in eve 
as noted above  nir at risk does not analyze changes in the value of principal cash flows and therefore does not experience the same reduction experienced by eve sensitivity associated with discounting principal cash flows at higher rates 
net interest revenue at risk nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on nir in the short term 
the impact of changes in market rates on nir is measured against a baseline nir which encompasses management expectations regarding the evolving balance sheet volumes and interest rates in the near term 
the goal is to achieve an acceptable level of nir under various interest rate environments 
assumptions regarding levels of client deposits and our ability to price these deposits under various rate environments have a significant impact on the results of the nir simulations 
similarly  the timing of cash flows from our investment portfolio  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  and our ability to replace these cash flows in line with management expectations  can affect the results of nir simulations 
the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of the dates indicated  due to an immediate basis point shift to our internal forecast of interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on management assumptions and do not reflect any additional actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on state street financial performance 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued estimated exposure to net interest revenue in millions december  december  rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp as of december   nir sensitivity to an upward basis point shock in market rates was lower compared to december  a larger fixed rate investment portfolio caused asset yields to respond more slowly to a rising rate environment  leading to a smaller benefit to nir compared to the benefit to nir for an upward basis point ramp is less significant than a shock  since market rates are assumed to increase gradually 
a downward basis point shock in market rates places pressure on nir  as deposit rates reach their implicit floors due to the exceptionally low interest rate environment  and provide little funding relief on the liability side  while assets reset into the lower rate environment 
nir sensitivity to a downward basis point shock in market rates as of december  was lower compared to december  due to the higher fixed rate composition of the investment portfolio  which slowed the decline in asset yields when rates fall relative to last year 
other important factors which affect the levels of nir are the size and mix of assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us and non us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  the pace of change in market interest rates  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
economic value of equity eve sensitivity measures changes in the market value of equity to quantify potential losses to shareholders due to an immediate basis point rate shock compared to current rate levels if the balance sheet were liquidated immediately 
management compares the change in eve sensitivity against state street tier and tier risk based capital to evaluate whether the magnitude of the exposure to interest rates is acceptable 
generally  a change resulting from a basis point rate shock that is less than of tier and tier risk based capital is an exposure that management deems acceptable 
to the extent that we manage changes in eve within the threshold  we would seek to take action to remain below the threshold if the magnitude of our exposure to interest rates approached that limit 
similar to nir at risk measures  the timing of cash flows affects eve  as changes in asset and liability values under different rate scenarios are dependent on when interest and principal payments are received 
in contrast to nir simulations  however  eve sensitivity does not incorporate assumptions regarding reinvestment of these cash flows 
in addition  our ability to price client deposits has a much smaller impact on eve  as eve sensitivity does not consider the ongoing benefit of investing client deposits 
the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of the dates indicated  assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 
estimated sensitivity of economic value of equity in millions december  december  rate change bps shock bps shock eve exposure to an upward basis point shock as of december  was higher compared to december   as a result of a higher level of purchases of fixed rate investment securities during the year relative to the decrease in rates relative to year end to historically low levels causes some market rates to move to zero before achieving a full basis point decline in a downward shock  and thus limits the potential positive eve change  causing a significantly lower benefit compared to december  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit and counterparty risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms 
we assume credit and counterparty risk for both our on and off balance sheet exposures 
the extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on each counterparty risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk for a variety of products and durations 
we maintain guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
we use an internal rating system to assess our risk of credit loss 
state street risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools in conjunction with management judgment 
qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner  following a formal review and approval process  an internal credit rating based on our credit scale is assigned 
we evaluate and risk rate the credit of our counterparties on an individual basis at least annually 
significant exposures are reviewed daily by erm 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all extensions of credit 
as part of the approval and renewal process  due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
at any point in time  having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds of our consolidated total shareholders equity  exclusive of unrealized gains or losses  is not unusual 
we provide  on a selective basis  traditional loan products and services to key clients in a manner that is intended to enhance client relationships  increase profitability and manage risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based on credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb estimated incurred credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
this allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate to absorb estimated incurred credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
we also assume other types of credit exposure with our clients and counterparties 
we purchase securities under reverse repurchase agreements  which are agreements to resell 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
risk is managed through a variety of processes  including establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases primarily to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of pledged assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is required from the borrower 
we also provide our clients with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters and lines of credit and standby bond purchase agreements 
these exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually 
we maintain a separate reserve for estimated probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet facilities as of the balance sheet date  which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition 
this reserve is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
provisions to maintain the reserve at a level considered appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses in outstanding facilities are charged to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and erm 
procedures are in place for assessing impaired securities  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  we provide a broad array of services  including research  investment management  trading services and investment servicing  that give rise to operational risk 
consequently  active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for its management 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented and operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in a consistent manner across state street 
responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every employee at state street 
we maintain a governance structure related to operational risk designed to clearly identify responsibilities and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
the risk and capital committee of the board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework 
erm develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program 
business units are responsible for their own operational risk 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and periodically review the status of the business controls  which are designed to provide a sound operational environment 
the business units also identify  manage  and report on operational risk 
the operational risk committee reviews operational risk related information and policies  provides oversight of the operational risk program  and escalates operational risk issues of note to the mrac and risk and capital committee of the board 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining audit committee of the board 
our discipline in managing operational risk  which is a result of this emphasis on policy  guidelines  oversight  and independent review  provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 
business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of our business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  interest rate  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every employee at state street 
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue  would be classified as a loss due to business risk 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of our business  we hold assets under custody and administration and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our clients  and  in conformity with gaap  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
similarly  collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program  we lend securities to banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in most circumstances  we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled billion as of december   compared to billion as of december  we require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
state street holds the collateral received in connection with its securities lending services as agent  and these holdings are not recorded in its consolidated statement of condition 
the securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
we held  as agent  cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december  and december   respectively 
the collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients 
in certain cases  the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements  for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested 
we require the counterparty to the repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the amount of the repurchase agreement 
in our role as agent  the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
of the collateral of billion as of december  and billion as of december  referenced above  billion as of december  and billion as of december  was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements 
we or our agents held billion and billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of december  and december   respectively 
additional information about our securities finance activities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
in the normal course of our business  we use derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
the majority of the accounting policies described in note do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as those associated with fair value measurements  other than temporary impairment of investment securities and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting estimates 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining audit committee of the board 
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  including trading account assets  investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments 
as discussed in further detail below  changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income  or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition 
in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition  and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below 
as of december   approximately billion of our financial assets and approximately billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value on a recurring basis  compared to billion and billion  respectively  as of december  the amounts as of december  represented approximately of our consolidated total assets and approximately of our consolidated total liabilities  compared to and  respectively  as of december  the increase in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets as of december  compared to mainly reflected purchases of non us debt securities and mortgage backed securities available for sale as part of our re investment strategy 
our re investment strategy is more fully discussed under net interest revenue in consolidated results of operations in this management discussion and analysis 
additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities  we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact  we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
when possible  we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical  or similar  financial assets and liabilities 
when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets  we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
in some instances  certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets  as a result  we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value 
we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on a prescribed three level valuation hierarchy 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs level 
as of december   including the effect of master netting agreements  we categorized less than of our financial assets carried at fair value in level  approximately of our financial assets carried at fair value in 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued level  and approximately of our financial assets carried at fair value in level of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   on the same basis  we categorized approximately of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level  approximately of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level  and approximately of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level of the fair value hierarchy 
the assets categorized in level were substantially composed of trading account assets 
fair value for these securities was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
the assets categorized in level were composed of investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments 
fair value for the investment securities was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties 
information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process 
management utilizes a process to verify the information provided  including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions 
in addition  management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information 
such information may include known trades or  to the extent that trading activity is limited  comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations  execution prices and the timing of cash flows  and where information is available  back testing 
the derivative instruments categorized in level predominantly represented foreign exchange and interest rate contracts used in our trading activities  for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques  with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points  as well as observable interest rate curves 
the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level were composed of asset backed and mortgage backed securities available for sale 
level assets also included derivative instruments  composed of foreign exchange contracts 
the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level as of december  compared to december  declined approximately  primarily the result of transfers of non us debt securities to level  as fair value was measured using prices for which observable market information became available 
with respect to derivative instruments  we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and of our own credit 
we considered such factors as the market based probability of default by us and our counterparties  and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities  in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value 
valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not significant to our consolidated financial condition in  or other than temporary impairment of investment securities our portfolio of fixed income investment securities constitutes a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition 
gaap requires the use of expected future cash flows to evaluate other than temporary impairment of these investment securities 
the amount and timing of these expected future cash flows are significant estimates used in our assessment of other than temporary impairment 
additional information with respect to management assessment of other than temporary impairment is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows 
in determining these estimates  management relies on relevant and reliable information  including but not limited to deal structure  including optional and mandatory calls  market interest rate curves  industry standard asset class specific prepayment models  recent prepayment history  independent credit ratings  and recent actual and projected credit losses 
management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash flow expectations and resulting estimates 
management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash flow estimates at least quarterly 
additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided under financial condition investment securities in this management discussion and analysis 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  and both goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount 
we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances arise 
substantially all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions by our investment servicing line of business  with the remainder associated with our investment management line of business 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill is ultimately supported by revenue from our investment servicing and investment management lines of business 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances arise  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment of the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major lines of business 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies a market approach  based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  or an income approach  based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future 
events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate 
additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets  including information by line of business  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that no significant impairment occurred in  or goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of december  totaled approximately billion and billion  respectively  compared to billion and billion  respectively  as of december  recent accounting developments information with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k
