item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
we caution that assumptions  expectations  projections  intentions or beliefs about future events may  and often do  vary from actual results and the differences can be material 
some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from our expectations include changes in oil or natural gas prices  the timing of planned capital expenditures  availability of acquisitions  availability under our credit agreement borrowing base  uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results  operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells  the condition of the capital markets generally  as well as our ability to access them  the proximity to and capacity of gathering  processing and transportation facilities  uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are an independent energy company founded in july and engaged in the exploration  development  production and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the united states  with a particular emphasis on oil and natural gas shale plays and other unconventional resource plays 
our current operations are focused primarily on the oil and liquids rich portion of the eagle ford shale play in south texas and in the haynesville shale play in northwest louisiana 
in  more than of our total capital expenditures of million were directed to our operations in south texas  primarily in the eagle ford shale  as we sought to transition to a more balanced commodity portfolio through the drilling of wells that were prospective for oil and liquids 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total production by volume using a conversion ratio of one bbl of oil per six mcf of natural gas and of our total oil and natural gas revenues were attributable to oil production  primarily from the eagle ford shale 
in  we expect that approximately of our estimated capital expenditures of million will be directed to increasing our oil production and oil reserves in south texas  primarily in the eagle ford shale play 
although we did not drill any operated haynesville shale natural gas wells during  we directed approximately of our capital expenditures to the haynesville play in to participate in several non operated wells 
in addition to these primary operating areas  we have a growing acreage position in southeast new mexico and west texas where we plan to drill three exploratory wells to test the wolfcamp and bone spring plays during we also have a large exploratory leasehold position in southwest wyoming and adjacent areas in utah and idaho where we are testing the meade peak shale 
on february   our common stock began trading on the nyse under the symbol mtdr 
on february   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share the initial public offering 
we sold  shares of common stock in this offering and certain selling shareholders sold  shares of common stock  including shares sold pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters over allotment option on march  prior to trading on the nyse  there was no established public trading market for our common stock 
our business success and financial results are dependent on many factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments  as well as competition from other sources of energy 

table of contents commodity price volatility  in particular  is a significant risk factor for us 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand  which is impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  oil and natural gas price differentials and other factors 
prices for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids will affect the cash flows available to us for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
declines in oil  natural gas or natural gas liquids prices would not only reduce our revenues  but could also reduce the amount of oil  natural gas and or natural gas liquids that we can produce economically  and as a result  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reserves 
during  natural gas prices declined to their lowest levels in many years  ranging from a low of approximately per mmbtu in mid april to a high of approximately per mmbtu in late november  based upon the nymex henry hub natural gas futures contract price for the earliest delivery date 
natural gas prices had declined again since late november  before increasing to per mmbtu at march   based upon the nymex henry hub natural gas futures contract for the earliest delivery date 
we would not expect to drill any operated natural gas wells in either our haynesville or cotton valley properties until natural gas prices improve further from these levels or unless the costs to drill and complete these wells decline further from their recent levels or new technologies are developed that increase expected recoveries 
see risk factors our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
in  our operations were primarily focused on the exploration and development of our eagle ford shale properties in south texas  as we continued to execute our strategy to significantly increase our oil production and oil reserves during during the year ended december   we completed and began producing oil and natural gas from gross net eagle ford shale wells  including gross net operated and gross net non operated eagle ford shale wells 
we also completed and began producing oil and natural gas from gross net wells in the upper austin chalk and the lower austin chalk upper eagle ford  or chalkleford  intervals in in addition  during  we completed and began producing natural gas from gross net non operated haynesville shale wells 
we also re entered and drilled a horizontal lateral from the previously suspended crawford federal vertical well in southwest wyoming  we plan to complete this well in the third quarter of we had two contracted drilling rigs operating in south texas throughout except for a brief period near the end of the second quarter when we added a third rig to execute a two well contract  and almost all of our operated drilling and completion activities were focused on the eagle ford shale 
we did not drill any operated wells in the haynesville shale play in northwest louisiana during as a result of the decline in natural gas prices compared to recent years 
at march   we continued to have two contracted drilling rigs operating in south texas one in lasalle county and one in dewitt county 
our average daily production for the year ended december  was approximately  boe per day  including  bbl of oil per day and mmcf of natural gas per day  as compared to  boe per day  including bbl of oil per day and mmcf of natural gas per day for the year ended december  our total oil production increased almost eight fold to just over million bbl of oil during the year ended december   from approximately  bbl of oil during the year ended december  this increased oil production is a direct result of our drilling operations in the eagle ford shale 
oil production comprised approximately of our total production for the year ended december   as compared to only of our total production for the year ended december  
table of contents during the three months ended december  specifically  our average daily production was  boe per day  including  bbl of oil per day and mmcf of natural gas per day 
this was an increase of almost compared to our average daily production for the three months ended december  of  boe per day  including bbl of oil per day and mmcf of natural gas per day 
our total oil production increased ten fold to  bbl of oil during the three months ended december   as compared to total oil production of  bbl of oil during the three months ended december  our average daily production for the fourth quarter of was a sequential increase of from the average daily production of  boe per day  including  bbl of oil per day and mmcf of natural gas per day  achieved during the third quarter of for the three months ended december   our oil production grew sequentially  as compared to the three months ended september  at december   our estimated total proved reserves were million boe  including million bbl of oil and bcf of natural gas million boe 
at december   of our total proved reserves were proved developed reserves compared to at december  at december   of our total proved reserves were oil and of our total proved reserves were natural gas  as compared to oil and natural gas at december  our proved oil reserves grew almost three fold from million bbl at december  to million bbl at december  this growth in oil reserves was attributable to our drilling program in the eagle ford shale during our proved natural gas reserves declined to bcf at december  from bcf at december  as a result of substantially lower natural gas prices in  we removed bcf million boe of previously classified proved undeveloped natural gas reserves in the haynesville shale in northwest louisiana from our total proved reserves at june   and these proved undeveloped reserves were likewise not included in our estimated total proved reserves at december  as long as the leasehold acreage associated with these previously classified proved undeveloped natural gas reserves is held by production from existing haynesville wells  however  these natural gas volumes remain available to be developed by us or the operator at a future time should natural gas prices improve  drilling and completion costs decline or new technologies be developed that increase expected recoveries 
the pv of our estimated total proved reserves was million at december  compared to a pv of million at december   an increase of despite lower commodity prices used to estimate pv in compared to the pv at december  was determined using the month unweighted average of first day of the month oil and natural gas prices for of per barrel and per mmbtu  respectively  adjusted by lease for quality  energy content  regional price differentials and other expenses as needed compared to average oil and natural gas prices of per barrel and per mmbtu  respectively  adjusted as further described above  used to determine pv at december  the standardized measure of estimated future net cash flows from our total proved reserves  including estimated future income tax expenses  was million at december  and million at december   respectively 
pv is a non gaap financial measure 
for a reconciliation of pv to standardized measure  see business estimated proved reserves 
for the year ended december   our oil and natural gas revenues were approximately million  or an increase of about  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  our oil revenues increased over eight fold to approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our total realized revenues for  including realized gain on derivatives  were approximately million  or an increase of about  as compared to million for for the year ended december   our adjusted ebitda was approximately million  or an increase of about  as compared to an

we currently intend to allocate approximately of our capital expenditure budget to the exploration  development and acquisition of additional interests in south texas  primarily in the eagle ford shale play 
we also plan to allocate about of our capital expenditure budget to the exploration and acquisition of additional interests in the wolfcamp and bone spring plays in the delaware basin in southeast new mexico and west texas 
as a result of these anticipated capital expenditures in south texas and in southeast new mexico and west texas  we plan to dedicate approximately of our anticipated capital expenditure budget to opportunities prospective for oil and liquids production 
while we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for  the aggregate amount we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions  the actual costs to drill scheduled wells  our drilling results and our ability to obtain additional capital 
since approximately of our eagle ford acreage was either held by production or not burdened by lease expirations before  of our wolfcamp and bone spring acreage was either held by production or not burdened by lease expirations before and almost all of our haynesville acreage was held by production at december   we possess the financial flexibility to allocate our capital when and where we believe it is economical and justified 
as we continue to explore and develop our leasehold positions in the eagle ford shale in south texas and as we begin to explore and develop our leasehold positions in the wolfcamp and bone spring plays in southeast new mexico and west texas  we may face various challenges in establishing operations in new areas  including securing the necessary services to drill and complete wells and securing the necessary facilities to gather  process  transport and market the oil and natural gas that we produce 
we may also incur higher than anticipated costs associated with establishing new operating infrastructure on our leases throughout the area 
we believe that we have successfully secured the necessary drilling and completion services for our current eagle ford operations 
we did not experience difficulties in securing completion  and in particular hydraulic fracturing  services for our newly drilled wells during the year ended december   although we experienced these problems at various times during in south texas and may have such difficulties again in the future 
we believe that maintaining reliable and timely drilling and completion services and reducing drilling and completion costs will be essential to the successful development and profitability of the eagle ford shale play  as well as the wolfcamp and bone spring plays in southeast new mexico and west texas 
see risk factors the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  completion equipment and services  supplies and personnel  including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel  could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we did experience temporary pipeline and natural gas processing interruptions from time to time during the year ended december  associated with natural gas production from our eagle ford shale wells 
to alleviate most of the interruptions and processing capacity constraints we experienced during  effective september   we entered into a firm five year natural gas processing and transportation agreement whereby we committed to transport the anticipated natural gas production from a significant portion of our eagle ford acreage in south texas through the counterparty s system for processing at the counterparty s facilities 
the agreement also includes firm transportation of the natural gas liquids extracted at the counterparty s processing plant downstream for fractionation 
no assurance can be made that this agreement will alleviate these issues completely  and if we were required to shut in our 
table of contents production for long periods of time due to pipeline interruptions or lack of processing facilities or capacity of these facilities  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may experience similar interruptions and processing capacity constraints as we begin to explore and develop our wolfcamp and bone spring plays in southeast new mexico and west texas in see risk factors the marketability of our production is dependent upon oil and natural gas gathering  processing and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties  and the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas gathering  processing and transportation arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our revenue 
revenues our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids production 
our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in oil  natural gas or natural gas liquids prices 
realized gain on derivatives 
we use commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
this revenue item includes the net realized cash gains and losses associated with the settlement of these derivative financial instruments for a given reporting period 
unrealized gain loss on derivatives 
we use commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
this revenue item recognizes the non cash change in the fair value of our open derivative contracts between reporting periods 
the following table summarizes our revenues and production data for the periods indicated year ended december  operating results revenues in thousands oil natural gas total oil and natural gas revenues realized gain on derivatives unrealized loss gain on derivatives total revenues net production volumes oil mbbl natural gas bcf total oil equivalent mboe average daily production boe d average sales prices oil  with realized derivatives per bbl oil  without realized derivatives per bbl natural gas  with realized derivatives per mcf natural gas  without realized derivatives per mcf estimated using a conversion ratio of one bbl of oil per six mcf of natural gas 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues 
our oil and natural gas revenues increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended 
table of contents december  this increase in oil and natural gas revenues reflects an increase in our oil revenues of million and a decrease in our natural gas revenues of million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our oil revenues increased over eight fold to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our oil production also increased almost eight fold to just over million bbl of oil  or about  bbl of oil per day  from approximately  bbl of oil  or about bbl of oil per day  during the comparable periods due to our drilling operations in the eagle ford shale 
a portion of this increase in oil revenue also reflects a higher weighted average oil price of per bbl realized during the year ended december   as compared to a weighted average oil price of per bbl realized during the year ended december  the decrease in our natural gas revenues reflects a decline in our natural gas production by about to approximately bcf for the year ended december   as compared to approximately bcf for the year ended december  this decline in natural gas production is due to several factors  including i the natural decline in natural gas production primarily from our existing haynesville shale and cotton valley wells in northwest louisiana and east texas  coupled with our decision not to drill any operated haynesville shale or cotton valley wells in  ii the voluntary curtailment by the operators of natural gas production from some of our non operated haynesville shale wells in northwest louisiana at various times during and iii delays in natural gas production from our newly completed eagle ford shale wells in south texas as a result of natural gas pipeline and production facility constraints 
this decrease in natural gas revenues also results from a significantly lower weighted average natural gas price of per mcf realized during the year ended december   as compared to a weighted average natural gas price of per mcf realized during the year ended december  realized gain on derivatives 
our realized gain on derivatives increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we realized a gain of approximately million on our open natural gas derivative contracts and a gain of approximately million on our open oil derivative contracts 
as a result of declining natural gas prices between the comparable periods  we realized an average gain of approximately per mmbtu hedged on all of our open natural gas costless collar contracts during the year ended december   as compared to per mmbtu hedged on all of our open natural gas costless collar contracts during the year ended december  our total natural gas volumes hedged for the year ended december  were also approximately higher than the total natural gas volumes hedged for the year ended december  we realized an average gain of per bbl hedged on all of our open oil contracts during the year ended december  we had no open oil or ngl derivative contracts during the year ended december  unrealized gain loss on derivatives 
our unrealized loss on derivatives was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to an unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  during the period from december  to december   the net fair value of our open oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids derivative contracts decreased from approximately million to approximately million  resulting in an unrealized loss on derivatives of approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the net fair value of our open natural gas costless collar contracts decreased by million due primarily to the gains realized on these contracts during the net fair value of our open oil derivative contracts increased million during the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in oil prices at december  compared to december  and also as a result of two additional oil derivatives contracts we entered into during during the year ended december   we also entered into various ngl swap contracts which had a net fair value of approximately million at december  we had no open ngl swap contracts during the year ended december  
table of contents year ended december  as compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues 
our oil and natural gas revenues increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase in oil and natural gas revenues corresponds with an increase of about in our oil and natural gas production to million boe for the year ended december  from million boe for the year ended december  this increased production was almost entirely due to drilling operations in the eagle ford and haynesville shales 
a portion of the increase in oil and natural gas revenues reflects the approximate five fold increase in our oil production for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as well as a higher average oil price of per bbl realized during  as compared to an average oil price of per bbl realized during realized gain on derivatives 
our realized gain on derivatives increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the realized gain from our open natural gas costless collar contracts increased primarily as a result of the decline in natural gas prices during the comparable periods 
we realized approximately per mmbtu hedged on all of our open natural gas costless collar contracts during the year ended december  as compared to per mmbtu hedged on all of our open natural gas costless collar contracts during the year ended december  our total natural gas volumes hedged for the year ended december  were also approximately higher than the total natural gas volumes hedged for unrealized gain loss on derivatives 
our unrealized gain on derivatives was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to an unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  during the period from december  to december   the net fair value of our open natural gas costless collar contracts increased by approximately million  due primarily to a decrease in natural gas prices during  as compared to  as well as to an increase in the total number of our open natural gas costless collar contracts at december   as compared to december  the net fair value of our open oil derivative contracts decreased by approximately million during the year ended december  expenses production taxes and marketing 
production taxes are paid on produced oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at market prices not hedged prices or at fixed rates established by federal  state or local taxing authorities 
we attempt to take advantage of all credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions 
in general  the production taxes we pay tend to correlate to the changes in our oil and natural gas revenues 
marketing expenses are fees charged by the purchasers of the oil and natural gas we produce and sell and principally include compression  processing  transportation and marketing fees 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses are the daily costs incurred to produce oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  as well as the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include field personnel costs  utilities  chemical additives  salt water disposal  maintenance  repairs and occasional workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 
depletion  depreciation and amortization 
depletion  depreciation and amortization includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas 
we use the full cost method of accounting and  accordingly  we capitalize all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproved and unevaluated property costs 
internal costs are capitalized only to the extent they are directly 
table of contents related to acquisition  exploration or development activities and do not include any costs related to production  selling or general corporate administrative activities 
capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves quantities 
unproved and unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base used to determine depletion  depreciation and amortization 
accretion of asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations relate to the future costs associated with plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas wells  removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
we recognize the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value  with an offsetting increase recognized in oil and natural gas properties or support equipment and facilities on the balance sheet 
periodic accretion of the discounted value of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
full cost ceiling impairment 
the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized costs less related deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling  with any excess above the cost center ceiling charged to operations as a full cost ceiling impairment 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a the present value discounted at percent of future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves  plus b unproved and unevaluated property costs not being amortized  plus c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved and unevaluated properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less d income tax effects related to the properties involved 
future net revenues from proved non producing and proved undeveloped reserves are reduced by the estimated costs of developing these reserves 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is not included in the ceiling test computation as we do not designate these instruments as hedge instruments for accounting purposes 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include  but are not limited to  compensation and benefits for our employees  costs of renting and maintaining our headquarters  office service contracts  board of directors fees  franchise taxes  stock based compensation expense and accounting  legal and other professional fees 
other income expense net gain loss on asset sales and inventory impairment 
this other income expense item includes the net gain or loss we experience on infrequent asset sales or impairment charges associated with certain equipment held in inventory 
this item also includes infrequent sales of oil and natural gas properties that we consider to be extraordinary when considered in relation to the normal course of our business 
interest expense 
interest expense includes interest paid to our lenders as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
we finance a portion of our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under the credit agreement  and as a result  we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
in addition  we include any amortization of deferred financing costs including origination  borrowing base increase and amendment fees  commitment or facility fees and annual agency fees as interest expense and in our interest rate calculations and related disclosures 
interest and other income 
interest income includes interest earned periodically on the cash and cash equivalents we hold in money market accounts composed of us treasury securities offering daily liquidity and the interest earned periodically on our certificates of deposit 
other income includes income we receive for providing salt water disposal and natural gas transportation services to other working interest participants in wells that we operate 

table of contents total income tax provision benefit 
total income tax provision benefit includes the net current and deferred portions of our estimated income tax liabilities 
we file a us federal income tax return and state tax returns in those states where we conduct oil and natural gas operations 
the current portion of our income tax provision benefit reflects actual income tax payments made or refunds received by us as a result of filing these income tax returns 
the deferred portion of our income tax provision is the result of temporary timing differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
the following table summarizes our operating expenses and other income expense for the periods indicated

our production taxes and marketing expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in our production taxes and marketing expenses primarily reflects the increase in our total oil and natural gas revenues by for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the majority of this increase was attributable to increased production taxes associated with the large increase in our oil production during resulting from our drilling operations in the eagle ford shale in south texas 
our total production was comprised of approximately oil and natural gas during the year ended december   as compared to approximately oil and natural gas during the year ended december  on a unit of production basis  our production taxes and marketing expenses increased by to per boe for the year ended december   as compared to per boe for the year ended december  lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended 
table of contents december  our total oil and natural gas production increased by about to approximately million boe for the year ended december  from approximately million boe for the year ended december   but our oil production increased almost eight fold to just over million bbl from approximately  bbl during the respective period 
the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily attributable to the increased costs associated with operating oil production resulting from drilling operations in the eagle ford shale in  as compared to the lower lease operating expenses associated with operating primarily dry natural gas production from the haynesville and cotton valley in in addition  oil production comprised of our total production during the year ended december   as compared to only for the year ended december   resulting in higher overall lease operating expenses during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we completed and initiated oil and natural gas production from gross net wells in the eagle ford shale plus gross net austin chalk chalkleford wells  most of which were on properties where new production facilities were being installed or natural gas pipelines were awaiting completion 
while these new facilities were being installed and tested  much of the oil and natural gas was produced through rental equipment monitored by hour contract personnel  resulting in higher operating costs from these properties during the year ended december  than we anticipate going forward now that the permanent production facilities and natural gas pipeline connections on most of these properties are complete 
approximately one third of our total lease operating expenses in were attributable to these extended flowback operations 
as we continue to drill on new properties in the eagle ford shale and in southeast new mexico and west texas throughout  however  we also expect to produce new wells on these properties through similar rental test equipment until more permanent facilities can be constructed and installed 
our lease operating expenses per unit of production increased to per boe for the year ended december   as compared to per boe for the year ended december  depletion  depreciation and amortization 
our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  on a unit of production basis  our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to per boe for the year ended december   as compared to per boe for the year ended december  this increase in our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily attributable to the decrease in our total proved oil and natural gas reserves to million boe at december   as compared to million boe at december  as a result of substantially lower natural gas prices in  we removed bcf million boe of previously classified proved undeveloped natural gas reserves in the haynesville shale in northwest louisiana from our total proved reserves at june   and these proved undeveloped reserves were likewise not included in our total proved reserves at december  the increase in depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses was also partially attributable to the increase of approximately in our oil and natural gas production to approximately million boe for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million boe for the year ended december   as well as to the higher drilling and completion costs on a per boe basis associated with oil reserves added in the eagle ford shale in south texas as compared with our haynesville shale natural gas assets in northwest louisiana 
accretion of asset retirement obligations 
our accretion of asset retirement obligations expenses increased by approximately  to  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in the accretion of our asset retirement obligations was due primarily to the addition of new wells through our drilling of operated wells and our participation in the drilling of non operated wells  although  on the whole  this item is an insignificant component of our overall expenses 

table of contents full cost ceiling impairment 
at june   the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the full cost ceiling by million 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties and a deferred income tax credit of million 
at september   the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the full cost ceiling by million 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties and a deferred income tax credit of million 
at december   the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the full cost ceiling by million 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties and a deferred income tax credit of million 
these full cost ceiling impairment charges in were primarily attributable to declining natural gas prices throughout much of the year 
as a result of substantially lower natural gas prices in  we had downward revisions of our natural gas reserves totaling bcf million boe  including the removal of bcf million boe of previously classified proved undeveloped natural gas reserves in the haynesville shale in northwest louisiana from our total proved reserves at june  these impairment charges are reflected in our operating expenses for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the cost center ceiling by million 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties and a deferred income tax credit of million  which is reflected in our operating expenses for the year ended december  general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our general and administrative expenses decreased by on a unit of production basis to per boe for the year ended december   as compared to per boe for the year ended december  the increase in our general and administrative expenses was attributable to increased compensation  accounting  legal and other administrative expenses  most of which was associated with becoming a public company in february  partially offset by a net decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net gain loss on asset sales and inventory impairment 
we incurred a loss on asset sales and inventory impairment of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the loss during was primarily related to the impairment of certain equipment held in inventory  mostly consisting of drilling rig parts 
during the year ended december   the loss was primarily related to the sale of pipe and other equipment and the impairment of certain equipment held in inventory  mostly consisting of drilling rig parts 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   we incurred total interest expense of approximately million 
we capitalized approximately million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the year ended december  and expensed the remaining million to operations 
in february  we repaid our borrowings then outstanding of million under our credit agreement using a portion of the net proceeds received from our initial public offering 
from march through december   we borrowed million under our credit agreement to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our total outstanding borrowings at december  were million  and the effective interest rate on the borrowings was approximately 
at december   we had total borrowings of million outstanding under 
table of contents our credit agreement  and we incurred total interest expense of approximately million 
we capitalized approximately million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the year ended december  and expensed the remaining million to operations 
interest and other income 
our interest and other income decreased by approximately million to approximately million  or a decrease of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in our interest and other income was due primarily to a decrease in the natural gas transportation income received from third parties during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our cash and certificates of deposit decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  total income tax provision benefit 
we recorded a total income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to a total income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the cost center ceiling by million 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties and a deferred income tax credit of million 
the increase in our deferred tax assets as a result of the impairment charges recorded during the year ended december  caused our deferred tax assets to exceed our deferred tax liabilities  resulting in the establishment of a valuation allowance of million due to uncertainties regarding the future realization of our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the total income tax benefit for the year ended december  reflected deferred income taxes almost entirely  with the exception of a state of louisiana income tax refund of approximately  recorded during this period 
we had a net loss for the years ended december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  production taxes and marketing 
our production taxes and marketing expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of approximately for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in our production taxes and marketing expenses reflects the increases in both our oil and natural gas production and revenues by and  respectively  during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the majority of this increase was due to higher marketing  transportation and compression charges on portions of our non operated haynesville shale production in as compared to some of this increase was also due to haynesville shale wells completed in  several of which were turned to sales or produced their first significant production volumes during although we or outside operators applied for exemptions from initial production taxes on these haynesville shale wells  some of these wells had not been approved for production tax exemptions at december  thus  we paid or accrued for the associated production taxes on these wells during the year ended december   although these production taxes were refunded to us in future periods as expected 
we adjusted our production taxes and marketing expenses accordingly during the future periods when these production tax exemptions were approved 
the remainder of the increase in production taxes and marketing expenses for the year ended december  was due to production taxes paid on production from our initial eagle ford shale wells in south texas 

table of contents lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  during these respective periods  however  our oil and natural gas production increased from million boe to million boe 
as a result  our lease operating expenses per unit of production decreased by to per boe for the year ended december   as compared to per boe for the year ended december  during the year ended december   both our total haynesville shale production  as well as the percentage of our haynesville production for which we were the operator  increased as compared to the year ended december  the per unit lease operating expenses associated with the haynesville production were much less than those associated with our cotton valley natural gas production  primarily due to the greater salt water disposal costs associated with the cotton valley production and given the early stages of production then associated with many of these haynesville wells 
depletion  depreciation and amortization 
our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses was due primarily to an increase of approximately in our oil and natural gas production from million boe to million boe during the respective time periods 
our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses on a unit of production basis increased to per boe for the year ended december   or an increase of about  from per boe for the year ended december  this per unit increase reflected increases in drilling and completion costs for wells drilled to the haynesville shale during  as well as higher drilling and completion costs on a per boe basis associated with oil reserves added in the eagle ford shale in south texas 
accretion of asset retirement obligations 
our accretion of asset retirement obligations expenses increased by approximately  to approximately  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in the accretion of asset retirement obligations was due primarily to the addition of new wells through our drilling of operated wells and our participation in the drilling of non operated wells  although  on the whole  this item is an insignificant component of our overall expenses 
full cost ceiling impairment 
during the quarter ended march   the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the cost center ceiling by million 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties and a deferred income tax credit of million  which is reflected in our expenses for the year ended december  no impairment to the net carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties on the balance sheet resulting from the full cost ceiling limitation was recorded for the year ended december  general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  or an increase of about  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in our general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased cash and non cash compensation expenses and increased accounting expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  we recorded approximately million in non cash compensation expense for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million recorded for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a change in accounting method for valuing our outstanding stock options 
we awarded no new stock options during as a result of our increased oil and natural gas production  however  our general and administrative expenses decreased by on a unit of production basis to per boe for the year ended december   as compared to per boe for the year ended december  
table of contents net gain loss on asset sales and inventory impairment 
we incurred a loss on asset sales and inventory impairment of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to a loss of approximately  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   this loss was primarily related to the sale of pipe and other equipment and the impairment of certain equipment held in inventory  consisting primarily of drilling rig parts 
during the year ended december   we wrote off the boise south pipeline asset in orange county  texas and recognized a net loss of approximately  we also recognized an impairment of approximately  to some of our equipment held in inventory following a determination that the market value of the equipment  consisting primarily of drilling rig parts  was less than the cost 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   we incurred total interest expense of approximately million 
we capitalized approximately million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the year ended december  and expensed the remaining million to operations 
during the year ended december   we incurred incremental net borrowings of million under our credit agreement to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our total outstanding borrowings at december  were million  and the interest rate on these borrowings was approximately per annum 
in early january  we converted this million base rate advance to a eurodollar based advance  which then bore interest at per annum 
in december  we borrowed million under our credit agreement to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and capital expenditures  which remained outstanding at december  we incurred interest expense of approximately  for the year ended december  interest and other income 
our interest and other income decreased by approximately million to approximately million  or a decrease of about  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in our interest and other income was due primarily to a decrease in the average balances of our cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit on which we received interest income between the two periods 
our cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december   as we used cash and incremental borrowings to acquire additional leasehold acreage in the eagle ford shale play in south texas and in the core area of the haynesville shale play in northwest louisiana and to fund our operated and non operated drilling and completion activities in both areas 
total income tax provision benefit 
we recorded a total income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to a total income tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  the total income tax benefit for the year ended december  reflected deferred income taxes almost entirely  with the exception of a state of louisiana income tax refund of approximately  recorded during this period 
we recorded a total income tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  the total income tax provision for the year ended december  included a deferred income tax provision of approximately million and a current income tax benefit of approximately million  which was attributable to a refund of us federal income taxes received by us 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax provision was consistent with our income before income taxes  which included approximately million in unrealized hedging gains 
we had a net loss for the year ended december   and our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources prior to the consummation of our initial public offering on february   our primary sources of liquidity were capital contributions from private investors  our cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreement and the proceeds from a significant sale of a portion of our assets in the haynesville shale in our primary use of capital has been  and will continue to be during and for the foreseeable future  for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties 
we continually evaluate potential capital sources  including equity and debt financings  additional borrowings and joint ventures  in order to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements 
our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on our ability to access outside sources of capital and to continue to grow our operating cash flows 
at december   we had cash and certificates of deposit totaling approximately million  the borrowing base under our credit agreement was million and we had million of outstanding long term borrowings and approximately million in outstanding letters of credit 
these borrowings bore interest at an effective interest rate of approximately per annum 
from january through march   we borrowed an additional million under our credit agreement to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
at march   we had million of outstanding long term borrowings and approximately million in outstanding letters of credit 
on september   we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement which increased the maximum facility amount to million from million and increased the borrowing base from million to million as a result of our lenders review of our proved oil and natural gas reserves at june  the borrowing base under the credit agreement is scheduled to be redetermined automatically on may and november by the lenders based primarily on the estimated value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves at june and december of each year 
both we and the lenders may each request an unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base once between scheduled redetermination dates 
during the fourth quarter of  we requested one such unscheduled redetermination  and on december   the borrowing base was increased from million to million as a result of our lenders review of our proved oil and natural gas reserves at september  in addition  during the first quarter of  our lenders completed their review of our proved oil and natural gas reserves at december   and as a result  on march   the borrowing base under our credit agreement was increased to million 
this most recent redetermination constitutes the regularly scheduled may redetermination 
we expect to request an unscheduled redetermination of our borrowing base between each scheduled redetermination date during  which should result in approximately quarterly redeterminations of the borrowing base under our credit agreement throughout we expect additional increases to the borrowing base throughout  primarily as a result of anticipated increases in our proved oil and natural gas reserves  and particularly our proved developed oil and natural gas reserves 
as a result of this anticipated increase in borrowing capacity  together with our anticipated increases in oil production and related revenues  we expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations and future borrowing capacity under our credit agreement to fund our capital expenditure requirements for we use commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and to partially offset reductions in our cash flows from operations resulting from declines in commodity prices 
however  should our drilling activities be less successful than we anticipate or result in less growth in our proved oil and natural gas reserves or less cash flows than we anticipate in  or should oil prices decline substantially  we may require additional sources of financing  including through potential joint ventures and potential issuances of equity or debt securities  which may not be available on terms reasonably acceptable to us or at all 
to the extent such sources of financing are not available on terms reasonably acceptable to us  we may need to reduce our capital spending and rate of growth 

table of contents although a majority of our anticipated increase in cash flows from operations during the year ending december   as compared to our cash flows from operations in prior periods  is expected to come from development activities on proved properties in the eagle ford shale play at december   these development activities may be less successful than we anticipate 
further  a portion of our anticipated increase in cash flows from operations during the year ending december  is expected to come from exploration activities on currently unproved properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas and in the wolfcamp and bone spring plays in southeast new mexico and west texas  and these exploration activities may or may not be as successful as we anticipate 
additionally  any anticipated increases in our cash flows from operations are based upon current expectations of oil and natural gas prices for and the hedges we currently have in place 
if our exploration and development activities result in less cash flows than anticipated  we may seek additional sources of capital  including through additional borrowings under our credit agreement  the sale of debt securities  the sale of assets or acreage or entering into one or more joint ventures  none of which may be available 
in addition to future borrowings under our credit agreement  we may also seek to raise additional funds by selling shares of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock including debt securities or other preferential securities in the public markets or otherwise 
it is likely that any such sales would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to sell such debt or equity securities on terms acceptable to us 
it is also possible that  to the extent we are not able to obtain additional sources of capital  we may modify our planned capital expenditure budget for accordingly or enter into one or more joint ventures or other alternative financings 
exploration and development activities are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to sufficiently increase our reserves  cash flows from operations and borrowing base under our credit agreement 
see risk factors our exploration  development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed our cash flows from operations and potential borrowings  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms  which could adversely affect our future growth  risk factors drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk  with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and risk factors our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling

a portion of the increase in net cash provided by operating activities also reflects the approximate five fold increase in our oil production for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   as well as a higher weighted average oil price of per bbl realized during  as compared to a weighted average oil price of per bbl realized during some of this increase in net cash provided by operating activities is also due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling approximately million between december  and december  our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  due to our increased operating activity in south texas 
our accounts receivable increased to million at december   as compared to million at december   due primarily to the increase in our oil and natural gas production and associated revenues 
our operating cash flows are sensitive to a number of variables  including changes in our production and volatility of oil and natural gas prices between reporting periods 
regional and worldwide economic activity  weather  infrastructure capacity to reach markets and other variable factors significantly impact the prices of oil and natural gas 
these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
we use commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
in addition  we attempt to avoid long term service agreements in order to minimize ongoing future commitments

low oil or natural gas prices and the substantial volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in net cash used in investing activities reflected an increase of million in our oil and natural gas properties capital expenditures for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   and an increase of approximately million in expenditures for other property and equipment  which includes new pipeline infrastructure associated with our initial wells in the eagle ford shale 

table of contents approximately of our capital expenditures were allocated to drilling and completion operations and associated infrastructure and to the acquisition of additional acreage for the year ended december   as compared to approximately allocated to drilling and completion operations and associated infrastructure and allocated to acquisition of additional acreage for the year ended december  our oil and natural gas properties capital expenditures for the year ended december  were primarily due to expenditures associated with our operated drilling and completion activities and acreage acquisitions in the eagle ford shale  non operated drilling and completion activities in the eagle ford and haynesville shale plays and our acreage acquisitions in the delaware basin in west texas

among other things  this amendment increased the size of the facility and extended the term until december mrc energy company  a wholly owned subsidiary of matador resources company  was the borrower under the amended credit agreement 
borrowings were secured by mortgages on substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and by the equity interests of all of mrc energy company s wholly owned subsidiaries  which were also guarantors 
in addition  all obligations under the credit agreement were guaranteed by matador resources company  the parent corporation 
various commodity hedging agreements with one of the lenders under the credit agreement or an affiliate thereof were also secured by the collateral of and guaranteed by the eligible subsidiaries of mrc energy company 
the amount of the borrowings under the second amended and restated credit agreement were limited to the lesser of million or the borrowing base  which was determined by the lenders based primarily on the estimated value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves  but also on external factors  such as the lenders lending policies and the lenders estimates of future oil and natural gas prices  over which we have no control 
at december   the borrowing base was million and we had million in 
table of contents outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
in january  we borrowed an additional million to finance a portion of our working capital requirements  bringing the then outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement to million 
following the completion of our initial public offering  we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the then outstanding million under our credit agreement in february  at which time the borrowing base was reduced to million 
on february   the borrowing base was increased to million pursuant to a special borrowing base redetermination made at our request 
this borrowing base increase was determined by our lenders based upon  among other items  the increase in our proved oil and natural gas reserves at december  on september   we entered into our third amended and restated senior secured revolving credit agreement  which matures in december among other things  this amendment increased the maximum facility amount from million to million  increased the borrowing base from million to million and named rbc as administrative agent

both we and the lenders may request an unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base once each between scheduled redetermination dates 
during the fourth quarter of  we requested one such unscheduled redetermination  and on december   the borrowing base was increased from million to million as a result of our lenders review of our proved oil and natural gas reserves at september  in connection with this borrowing base redetermination  the conforming borrowing base was increased to million at december  in addition  during the first quarter of  our lenders completed their review of our proved oil and natural gas reserves at december   and as a result  on march   the borrowing base was increased to million and the conforming borrowing base was increased to million 
this most recent redetermination constitutes the regularly scheduled may redetermination 
in the event of a borrowing base increase  we are required to pay a fee to the lenders equal to a percentage of the amount of the increase  which will be determined based on market conditions at the time of the borrowing base increase 
if the borrowing base were to be less than the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at any time  we would be required to provide additional collateral satisfactory in nature and value to the lenders to increase the borrowing base to an amount sufficient to cover such excess or to repay the deficit in equal installments over a period of six months

at december   our outstanding borrowings bore interest at an effective interest rate of approximately per annum 

table of contents we expect to access future borrowings under our credit agreement to fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements in excess of amounts available from our operating cash flows 
we also intend to seek additional redeterminations of our borrowing base as a result of  among other items  any increases to our proved oil and natural gas reserves  and particularly our proved developed oil and natural gas reserves  primarily attributable to our ongoing drilling operations in the eagle ford shale 
from january through march   we borrowed an additional million under the credit agreement to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
at march   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement  approximately million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement and approximately million available for additional borrowings

at december   we believe that we were in compliance with the terms of our credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
obligations and commitments we had the following material contractual obligations and commitments at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations revolving credit borrowings  including letters of credit office lease drilling rig contracts asset retirement obligations natural gas processing and transportation agreement 
total contractual cash obligations at december   we had million in revolving borrowings outstanding under our third amended and restated credit agreement and approximately million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement 
these borrowings mature in december these amounts do not include estimated interest on the obligations  because our revolving borrowings had short term interest periods  and we are unable to determine what our borrowing costs may be in future periods 
at december   we were party to two drilling rig contracts to explore and develop our eagle ford acreage in south texas 
the two rigs began drilling on our acreage in march and december  respectively 
the rig that began drilling in march is under contract for one year 
this contract was renegotiated for an additional six month term effective march see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the rig that began drilling in december is under contract for nine months 
should we elect to terminate one or both contracts and if the drilling contractor were unable to secure work for one or both rigs or if the drilling contractor were unable to secure work for one or both rigs at the same daily rates being charged to us prior to the end of their respective contract terms  we would incur termination obligations 
our maximum outstanding aggregate termination obligations under these contracts were approximately million at december  general outlook and trends for the year ended december   oil prices ranged from a high of approximately per bbl in late february to a low of approximately per bbl in late june  based upon the nymex west texas intermediate oil futures contract price for the earliest delivery date 
oil prices remained near or above per bbl for much of the first four months of  but began declining in early may and throughout 
table of contents the remainder of the second quarter 
during the third and fourth quarters  oil prices rebounded somewhat  ranging from a low of per bbl in early july to a high of per bbl in mid september  before declining somewhat to per bbl at december  we realized a weighted average oil price of per bbl per bbl including realized gains from oil derivatives for our oil production for the year ended december  as compared to per bbl for the year ended december  at march   the nymex west texas intermediate oil futures contract for the earliest delivery date closed at per bbl  as compared to per bbl at march  for the year ended december   natural gas prices ranged from a low of approximately per mmbtu in mid april to a high of approximately per mmbtu in late november  based upon the nymex henry hub natural gas futures contract price for the earliest delivery date 
natural gas prices declined during most of the first three to four months of  reaching their lowest levels in many years  before increasing to per mmbtu in late november 
we realized a weighted average natural gas price of per mcf per mcf including realized gains from natural gas derivatives for our natural gas production for the year ended december   as compared to per mcf per mcf including realized gains from natural gas derivatives for the year ended december  natural gas prices had declined since late november  before increasing to per mmbtu at march   based upon the nymex henry hub natural gas futures contract for the earliest delivery date  as compared to per mmbtu at march  the prices we receive for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids heavily influence our revenue  profitability  cash flow available for capital expenditures  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids have been volatile and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
declines in oil  natural gas or natural gas liquids prices not only reduce our revenue  but could also reduce the amount of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids we can produce economically 
from time to time  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
even so  decisions as to whether and what production volumes to hedge are difficult and depend on market conditions and our forecast of future production and oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  and we may not always employ the optimal hedging strategy 
should oil  natural gas or natural gas liquids prices decrease to economically unattractive levels and remain there for an extended period of time  we may elect to delay some of our exploration and development plans for our prospects  or cease exploration or development activities on certain prospects due to the anticipated unfavorable economics from such activities  each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and reserves 
this  in turn  may affect the liquidity that can be accessed through the borrowing base under our credit agreement and through the capital markets 
like other oil and natural gas producing companies  our properties are subject to natural production declines 
by their nature  our wells in the eagle ford shale and austin chalk in south texas  the haynesville shale and cotton valley in northwest louisiana and east texas and the wolfcamp and bone spring plays in southeast new mexico and west texas will experience rapid initial production declines 
we attempt to overcome these production declines by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves  by exploring for new sources of reserves and  at times  by acquisitions 
during times of severe oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids price declines  however  we may find it necessary to reduce capital expenditures and curtail drilling operations in order to preserve liquidity 
a material reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities could materially impact our production volumes  revenues  reserves and cash flows 

table of contents we must focus our efforts on increasing oil and natural gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our ability to find and develop sufficient quantities of oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term success 
future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the costs of acquiring  drilling and completing our prospects 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have outlined below certain accounting policies that are of particular importance to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable  and believe that the actual results will not differ significantly from those reported  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates 
property and equipment we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and natural gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and reserves  including unproved and unevaluated property costs  are capitalized as incurred and accumulated in a single cost center representing our activities  which are undertaken exclusively in the united states 
such costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  lease rentals on undeveloped properties  costs of drilling both productive and non productive wells  capitalized interest on qualifying projects and general and administrative expenses directly related to exploration and development activities  but do not include any costs related to production  selling or general corporate administrative activities 
the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized costs less related deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling  with any excess above the cost center ceiling charged to operations as a full cost ceiling impairment 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a the present value discounted at percent of future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves  plus b unproved and unevaluated property costs not being amortized  plus c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved and unevaluated properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less d income tax effects related to the properties involved 
future net revenues from proved non producing and proved undeveloped reserves are reduced by the estimated costs of developing these reserves 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is not included in the ceiling test computation as we do not designate these instruments as hedge instruments for accounting purposes 
the estimated present value of after tax future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves is highly dependent on the commodity prices used in these estimates 
these estimates are determined in accordance with guidelines established by the sec for estimating and reporting oil and natural gas reserves 
under these guidelines  oil and natural gas reserves are estimated using then current operating and economic conditions  with no provision for price and cost escalations in future periods except by contractual arrangements 
capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserves quantities 
unproved and unevaluated property 
table of contents costs are excluded from the amortization base used to determine depletion 
unproved and unevaluated properties are assessed for impairment on a periodic basis based upon changes in operating or economic conditions 
this assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others the assignment of proved reserves  geological and geophysical evaluations  intent to drill  remaining lease term and drilling activity and results 
upon impairment  the costs of the unproved and unevaluated properties are immediately included in the amortization base 
exploratory dry holes are included in the amortization base immediately upon the determination that the well is not productive 
sales of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to net capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between net capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas 
all costs related to production activities and maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
significant workovers that increase the properties reserves are capitalized 
other property and equipment are stated at cost 
computer equipment  furniture  software and other equipment are depreciated over their useful life five to ten years using the straight line method 
support equipment and facilities include the pipelines and salt water disposal systems owned by longwood gathering and disposal systems  lp and are depreciated over a year useful life using the straight line  mid month convention method 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the lease 
derivative financial instruments from time to time  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
these instruments consist of put and call options in the form of costless or zero cost collars and swap contracts 
costless collars provide us with downside price protection through the purchase of a put option which is financed through the sale of a call option 
because the call proceeds are used to offset the cost of the put option  these arrangements are initially costless to us 
in the case of a costless collar  the put option and the call option have different fixed price components 
in a swap contract  a floating price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period  providing downside price protection 
our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting for our existing derivative financial instruments  and as a result  we recognize the change in derivative fair value between reporting periods currently in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of our derivative financial instruments is determined using purchase and sale information available for similarly traded securities 
realized gains and realized losses from the settlement of derivative financial instruments and unrealized gains and unrealized losses from valuation changes in the remaining unsettled derivative financial instruments are reported under revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition we follow the sales method of accounting for our oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids revenue  whereby we recognize revenue  net of royalties  on all oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sold to purchasers regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property 
under this method  revenue is recognized at the time the oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced and sold  and we accrue for revenue earned but not yet received 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc during  all stock option awards were granted under our long term stock and incentive plan and were equity instruments 
we did not grant any stock option awards in prior to  all stock option awards were granted under our stock and incentive plan  and since november   these awards have been accounted for as liability instruments 
we used the fair value method to measure and recognize the liability associated with our outstanding liability based stock options and to measure and recognize the equity associated with our equity based stock options 
stock options typically vest over four years  and the associated compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
restricted stock and restricted stock units typically vest over a period of one to four years  and compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
as our shares were not publicly traded prior to february   we estimated the future volatility of our stock using the historical volatility of the common stock of a group of companies we consider to be a representative peer group 
management believes that these average historical volatility rates are currently the best available indicator of future volatility 
we have adopted the simplified method as outlined in staff accounting bulletin topic for estimating the expected term of awards 
the risk free interest rate is the rate for constant yield us treasury securities with a term to maturity that is consistent with the expected term of the award 
assumptions are reviewed each time new equity based option awards are granted and quarterly for outstanding liability option awards 
the assumptions used may be impacted by actual fluctuations in our stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions produces a different fair value for equity based option awards and outstanding liability based option awards and impacts the amount of stock compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
we use the black scholes merton model to determine the fair value of service based option awards and the monte carlo method to determine the fair value of option awards that contain a market condition 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are recognized based on the fair value of our stock on the date of the grant 
all stock option awards were granted as non qualified options for which we will realize a tax benefit upon the exercise of the options 
historically  the majority of the stock option awards we granted were awarded as incentive stock options isos for which we were unable to realize a tax benefit upon the exercise of the options 
we may grant future stock option awards as isos 
in  we granted for the first time  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that contain a market condition 
we refer to these awards as performance based awards in note to our consolidated financial statements 
because these awards vest based on both a market condition and a service condition  the compensation expense for these awards will be recognized if the service condition is met  regardless of whether the market condition is met 
prior to november   all of our then outstanding stock options were classified as equity instruments  with the fair value of the awards measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period  if any 
on november   we changed our method of accounting for our then outstanding stock options  reclassifying all then outstanding stock options from equity to liability instruments 
this change was made as a result of purchasing shares from certain of our employees to assist them in the exercise of then outstanding options of our class a common stock 
at december   we continue to account for all stock options granted under our stock and incentive plan as liability instruments 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting 
we evaluate the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and provide a valuation allowance for the portion of any deferred tax assets where the likelihood of realizing an income tax benefit in the future does not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we have evaluated all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open  and we believe that the material positions taken would more likely than not be sustained by examination 
therefore  at december   we had not established any reserves for  nor recorded any unrecognized tax benefits related to  uncertain tax positions 
when necessary  we include interest assessed by taxing authorities in interest expense and penalties related to income taxes in other expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
oil and natural gas reserves quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue our engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues 
while the sec rules allow us to disclose proved  probable and possible reserves  we have elected to present only proved reserves in this annual report on form k 
the sec s rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
our engineers and technical staff must make many subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserves estimates 
reserves estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each well 
estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and is inexact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  petrophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of both the data and the associated interpretations can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  including  but not limited to  oil and natural gas prices  development expenditures  operating expenses  capital expenditures and taxes 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas will most likely vary from our estimates 
accordingly  reserves estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
any significant variance could materially and adversely affect our future reserves estimates  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserves revisions 
if such revisions are significant  they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including commodity price risk  interest rate risk and counterparty and customer risk 
we address these risks through a program of risk management including the use of derivative financial instruments 
commodity price exposure 
we are exposed to market risk as the prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids fluctuate as a result of changes in supply and demand and other factors 
to partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  we have entered into derivative financial instruments in the past and expect to enter into derivative financial instruments in the future to cover a significant portion of our future anticipated production 
we use costless or zero cost collars and or swap contracts to manage risks related to changes in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
costless collars provide us with downside price protection through the purchase of a put option which is financed through the sale of a call option 
because the call option proceeds are used to offset the cost of the put option  these arrangements are initially costless to us 
in the case of a costless collar  the put option and the call option have different fixed price components 
in a swap contract  a floating price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period  providing downside price protection 
we record all derivative financial instruments at fair value 
the fair value of our derivative financial instruments is determined using purchase and sale information available for similarly traded securities 
at december   comerica bank and rbc or affiliates thereof were the counterparties for all of our derivative instruments 
we have evaluated the credit standing of the counterparties in determining the fair value of our derivative financial instruments 

table of contents in november  we began entering into various costless collar transactions for the first time to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil prices  each with an established price floor and ceiling

table of contents effect of recent derivatives legislation on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which is intended to modernize and protect the integrity of the us financial system 
the dodd frank act  among other things  sets forth a framework for regulating certain derivative products including the commodity hedges of the type used by us  but many aspects of this law are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years 
as a result  it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the dodd frank act on our ability or willingness to continue entering into and maintaining such commodity hedges and the terms thereof 
based upon the limited assessments we are able to make with respect to the dodd frank act  there is the possibility that the dodd frank act could have a substantial and adverse impact on our ability to enter into and maintain these commodity hedges 
in particular  the dodd frank act could result in the implementation of position limits and additional regulatory requirements on our derivative arrangements  which could include new margin  reporting and clearing requirements 
in addition  this legislation could have a substantial impact on our counterparties and may increase the cost of our derivative arrangements in the future 
see risk factors the derivatives legislation adopted by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
interest rate risk 
we do not and have not used interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense on existing debt since we borrowed under our credit agreement for the first time in december at december  we had million in revolving borrowings outstanding under our third amended and restated credit agreement at an interest rate of approximately per annum 
if we incur additional indebtedness in the future and at higher interest rates  we may use interest rate derivatives 
interest rate derivatives would be used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
counterparty and customer credit risk 
joint interest receivables arise from billing entities which own partial interest in the wells we operate 
these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill 
we have limited ability to control participation in our wells 
we are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers 
the inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  our oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties 
while we do not require our customers to post collateral and we do not have a formal process in place to evaluate and assess the credit standing of our significant customers for oil and natural gas receivables and the counterparties on our derivative instruments  we do evaluate the credit standing of such counterparties as we deem appropriate under the circumstances 
this evaluation may include reviewing a counterparty s credit rating  latest financial information and  in the case of a customer with which we have receivables  its historical payment record  the financial ability of the customer s parent company to make payment if the customer cannot and undertaking the due diligence necessary to determine credit terms and credit limits 
the counterparties on our derivative instruments in place at march  were rbc  comerica bank and the bank of nova scotia or affiliates thereof and we are likely to enter into any future derivative instruments with rbc  comerica bank  the bank of nova scotia or other lenders or affiliates thereof party to the credit agreement 

table of contents impact of inflation 
inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and although the impact of inflation has been generally insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the us economy and we tend to specifically experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment with increases in oil and natural gas prices and with increases in drilling activity in our areas of operations  including the eagle ford shale and haynesville shale plays 
see business general 
see also risk factors the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  completion equipment and services  supplies and personnel  including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel  could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
