investments in sovereign and non sovereign debt of european countries represent less than of our assets under management 

table of contents the geography of a particular investment product describes the general location of its investment holdings 
during the year ended december   on an asset class basis  we experienced organic growth from net client cash flows in our alternative billion and equity asset classes billion 
on a geographic basis  our global products benefited from net client cash flows of billion and the domestic and emerging markets products benefited from net client cash flows of billion and billion  respectively 
strong investment performance across all geographic areas and in the alternative and equity asset classes also contributed to growth in during the year ended december   we experienced strong organic growth from net client cash flows in our alternative billion and equity asset classes billion 
our global products benefited from net client cash flows of billion and the emerging markets products benefited from net client cash flows of billion  partially offset by negative investment performance across all geographic regions 
assets under management by operating segment the following tables present a rollforward of our assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this annual report on form k

as shown in the assets under management table above  client cash inflows totaled billion while client cash outflows totaled billion for the year ended december  the net flows for the year ended december  occurred across a broad range of product offerings in each of our distribution channels  with no individual cash inflow or outflow having a significant impact on our revenue or expenses 
the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management represent an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management reflect the billing patterns of particular client accounts 
for example  assets under management for an account that bills in advance is presented in the table on the basis of beginning of period assets under management while an account that bills in arrears is reflected on the basis of end of period assets under management 
assets under management attributable to any investment in new affiliates are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective investment 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates 
table of contents to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue

during and  we recognized impairments on an indefinite lived intangible asset at one of our affiliates of million and million  respectively 
during  we determined that the value of a cost method investment had been reduced to zero  and recorded an expense of million 

table of contents ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in supplemental liquidity measure on page results of operations our affiliate investments are generally structured as revenue sharing arrangements 
when we own a controlling interest  we consolidate the affiliates results 
our discussion of revenue and operating expenses relates to our consolidated affiliates 
when we hold a minority investment and are required to use the equity method of accounting  we do not consolidate the operating results of these firms including their revenue 
our share of these firms earnings net of intangible amortization is reported in income from equity method investments and is discussed on page revenue our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management and the composition of our assets across our operating segments and products within our operating segments  which realize different fee rates 
our ratio of revenue to average assets under management in total and by channel is calculated as revenue divided by average assets under management and may change as a result of new investments  net client cash flows  performance and  to a lesser extent  changes in contractual fees 
therefore  changes in this ratio should not necessarily be viewed as an indicator of changes in contractual fee rates billed to our affiliates clients 
our revenue is also determined by the level of performance fees recognized 
performance fees are generally measured on absolute or relative investment performance against a benchmark 
as a result  the level of performance fees earned can vary significantly from period to period and these fees may not necessarily be correlated to changes in assets under management 
our revenue increased million or in from  primarily from an increase in average assets under management from our consolidated affiliates  partially offset by a decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management resulted principally from investment performance  net client cash flows and our new affiliate investments in the decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management resulted from changes in the composition of our assets under management  including decreases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and increases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively lower fee rates 
our revenue increased million or in from  primarily from a increase in average assets under management from our consolidated affiliates  partially offset by a decline in performance fees from our consolidated affiliates 
this increase in average assets under management resulted from the full year impact of our investments in new affiliates and net client cash flows  partially offset by a decline in global equity markets during unrelated to the change in assets under management  consolidated performance fees declined million to million or in  as compared to neither changes in the composition of our assets under management between operating segments nor changes to our contractual fee rates had a significant impact on our results

table of contents operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative intangible amortization and impairments depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses a substantial portion of our operating expenses was incurred by our affiliates  the majority of which was incurred by affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate operating allocation percentage generally determined its operating expenses 
accordingly  our compensation expense was generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective operating allocation 
the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varied from one affiliate to another and may vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue did not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
compensation and related expenses increased million or in and million or in the increase in of million was primarily the result of increases in aggregate affiliate expenses attributable to new affiliate investments in the increase was also the result of a million increase primarily in long term incentive compensation 
the increase in of million was primarily a result of increases in aggregate affiliate expenses from the full year impact of new affiliate investments in the increases in and were also a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at extant affiliates which experienced increases in revenue  and accordingly  reported higher compensation expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in this increase was primarily a result of increases in affiliate expenses from new affiliate investments in of million 
this increase was also attributable to an increase in acquisition related professional fees  as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in this increase was primarily a result of increases of million in aggregate affiliate expenses from the full year impact of new affiliate investments in this increase was also attributable to increases in sub advisory and distribution expenses attributable to increases in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in acquisition related professional fees  as compared to intangible amortization and impairments increased million or in and million or in these increases were primarily the result of impairments associated with an indefinite lived intangible asset at one of our affiliates of million in and million in the increase in was also attributable to the full year impact of amortization of definite lived intangible assets resulting from new affiliate investments in income from equity method investments when we own a minority investment and are required to use the equity method of accounting  we only recognize our share of these affiliates earnings generally calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue net of intangible amortization 
accordingly  we have not consolidated these affiliates 
table of contents operating results including their revenue 
the following table summarizes our share of the profits from our equity method investments in millions change change income from equity method investments income from equity method affiliates increased million or in this increase was the result of increases in revenue  including performance fees  as well as our additional investment in bluemountain during income from equity method affiliates decreased million or in this decrease was primarily the result of decreases in performance fees 
other income statement data the following table summarizes non operating income and expense data in millions change change investment and other income loss nm nm interest expense imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements nm income taxes percentage change is not meaningful 
investment and other income increased million in  as compared to  principally as a result of increases in affiliate investment earnings 
this increase was also a result of a million write off of a cost method investment in  which did not recur in investment and other income decreased million in  as compared to  principally as a result of increases in affiliate investment losses 
this decrease also resulted from the write off of the cost method investment noted previously 
interest expense increased million or in  primarily as a result of the issuance of the senior notes due in the senior notes and the senior notes due in the senior notes as well as increased borrowings under our credit facility 
interest expense increased million or in  principally as a result of an increase in the cost of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
this increase was also attributable to a million increase in issuance costs related to the credit facility amendment that occurred in imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements consists of interest accretion on our senior convertible securities and our junior convertible trust preferred securities  as well as the accretion and revaluation of our contingent payment arrangements 
imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements decreased million in as compared to this decrease relates primarily to gains on the revaluation of contingent payment arrangements of million which occurred in imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements increased million or in as compared to  principally as a result of a million increase in accretion related to our contingent payment arrangements related to investments in new affiliates partially offset by a million gain on revaluation 
income taxes decreased million or in from an million reduction in our valuation allowance  principally on benefits of uncertain tax positions from an improved projection of us income 
this benefit was offset by a million increase in taxes attributable to the non controlling interest 
income taxes increased million or in  as the result of an increase in income before income taxes  partially offset by a million benefit from revaluing certain deferred tax liabilities as a result of a change to corporate tax rates in the united kingdom 

table of contents net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years in millions change change net income net income non controlling interests net income controlling interest net income non controlling interests increased million or in this increase was principally a result of our new affiliate investments in and increases in affiliate investment earnings  as well as gains on the revaluation of contingent payment arrangements attributable to the non controlling interests of million 
net income non controlling interests increased million or in this change resulted principally from the previously discussed changes in revenue for the period as well as affiliate equity issuances which had the effect of increasing affiliate equity ownership  and therefore increasing net income attributable to non controlling interests 
these increases were partially offset by increases in amortization  interest expenses  tax expenses and investment losses attributable to non controlling interests  as compared to net income controlling interest increased million or and million or in and primarily as a result of the previously discussed increases in revenue for each period  partially offset by increases in operating expenses including the impairment associated with an indefinite lived intangible asset at one of our affiliates described above 
supplemental performance measures as supplemental information  we provide non gaap performance measures that we refer to as economic net income and economic earnings per share 
we consider economic net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents our operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our investment management firms 
economic net income and economic earnings per share are used by our management and board of directors as our principal performance benchmarks  including as measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
these measures are provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income controlling interest and earnings per share 
economic net income and economic earnings per share are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of any liquidity measure calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
under our economic net income definition  we add to net income controlling interest amortization including equity method amortization and impairments  deferred taxes related to intangible assets  non cash imputed interest expense principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements and certain affiliate equity expense 
we add back amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations 
we add back non cash imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations 
we add back non cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between affiliate management partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders 
economic earnings per share represents economic net income divided by the adjusted diluted average shares outstanding  which measures the potential share issuance from our senior convertible securities and junior convertible securities each further described in liquidity and capital resources using a treasury stock method 
under this method  only the net number of shares of common stock 
table of contents equal to the value of these securities in excess of par  if any  are deemed to be outstanding 
we believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation 
this method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion

our share of these investments amortization is reported in income from equity method investments 
our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to our non controlling interests  amounts not added back to net income controlling interest to measure our economic net income 
reported intangible amortization includes a million and million expense in and  respectively  associated with the impairment of an indefinite lived intangible asset at one of our affiliates 
the following table summarizes the intangible amortization and impairments shown above in millions reported intangible amortization and impairments equity method amortization intangible amortization non controlling interests total as described in note above  we recognized impairments of certain of our indefinite lived intangible assets during and in addition  we recorded a reduction in the united kingdom tax rate

liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources december  in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt senior notes senior convertible securities junior convertible trust preferred securities cash flow data operating cash flow investing cash flow financing cash flow ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented below under supplemental liquidity measure 
we view our ratio of debt to ebitda our internal leverage ratio as an important gauge of our ability to service debt  make new investments and access additional capital 
consistent with industry practice  we do not consider junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our internal leverage ratio 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting from our debt balance holding company cash 
at december   our internal leverage ratio was under the terms of our credit facility we are required to meet two financial ratio covenants 
the first of these covenants is a maximum ratio of debt to ebitda the bank leverage ratio of the calculation of our bank leverage ratio is generally consistent with our internal leverage ratio approach 
the second covenant is a minimum ebitda to cash interest expense ratio of our bank interest coverage ratio 
for purposes of calculating these ratios  share based compensation expense is added back to ebitda 
as of december   our actual bank leverage and bank interest coverage ratios were and  respectively  and we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facility 
we have million of remaining capacity under our credit facility  and could borrow substantially all such capacity and remain in compliance with our credit facility 
we are rated bbb by both standard poor and fitch rating agencies 
with the exception of a modest increase in the borrowing rate under our credit facility  a downgrade of our credit rating would have no direct financial effect on any of our agreements or securities or otherwise trigger a default 
supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information  we have provided information regarding ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operating activities 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda 
table of contents by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to ebitda in millions cash flow from operating activities interest expense  net of non cash items current tax provision income from equity method investments  net of distributions net income non controlling interests changes in assets and liabilities other non cash adjustments ebitda non cash items include amortization of issuance costs and imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements million  million and million in  and  respectively

other non cash adjustments include share based compensation expenses  tax benefits from stock options and other adjustments to reconcile net income controlling interest to net cash flow from operating activities 
in the twelve months ended december   we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  borrowings under our revolver and the issuance of the senior notes 
our principal uses of cash were to make investments in new and existing affiliates  make distributions to affiliate partners and repay our other liabilities 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing affiliates  settlement of contingent payment arrangements  distributions to affiliate partners  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  and for working capital purposes

senior bank debt we have a  million senior unsecured credit facility the credit facility  consisting of an million revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan 
we pay interest on any outstanding obligations at specified rates based either on the libor rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time 
a portion of the revolver million matures in january with the balance of million and the term loan maturing in november subject to certain conditions  we may increase the revolver and the term loan by up to million and million  respectively 
the credit facility is unsecured and contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage  as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  cash dividends  asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes 
senior notes at december   we have two senior notes outstanding 
the principal terms of these notes are summarized below

these convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations  which require us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense 
the senior convertible notes are convertible into a defined number of shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events 
upon conversion  we may elect to pay or deliver cash  shares of common stock  or some combination thereof 
the holders of the senior convertible notes may put these securities to us in august of    and we may call the notes for cash at any time on or after august  should either of these events occur  we currently intend to satisfy our obligations with borrowings under our credit facility 
both the and junior convertible trust preferred securities are convertible  at any time  into a defined number of shares 
upon conversion  holders will receive cash or shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof 
we can call the junior convertible trust preferred securities if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
we can call the junior convertible trust preferred securities if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
holders of the and junior convertible trust preferred securities have no rights to put these securities to us 
derivative instruments from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge 
we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange a fixed rate for the variable rate on a portion of our credit facility 
these contracts expire between and under these contracts  we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of on a notional amount of million through october thereafter  through october  we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of

we have the ability to settle the contracts either by delivering shares of common stock and receiving cash or net settling for cash or shares of common stock 
all contracts remain outstanding 
affiliate equity many of our operating agreements provide us a conditional right to call and affiliate partners the conditional right to put their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
the purchase price of these conditional purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate cash flow distributions  which is intended to represent fair value 
affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases  subject to our approval or other restrictions 
our current redemption value for these interests has been presented as redeemable non controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict  we expect to repurchase approximately million of affiliate equity during  and  in such event  will own the cash flow associated with any equity repurchased 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income adjusted for cash distributions from equity method investments  non cash charges for intangible amortization and impairments  imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements  share based compensation as well as increases and decreases in our consolidated working capital

these increases in cash flows were partially offset by an increase in affiliate equity issuances and repurchases of million

we used available cash and borrowings under our credit facility to finance our investments in veritable  yacktman and bluemountain during  as well as our investments in artemis and trilogy during in  we issued shares of common stock for our aston investment and we financed our pantheon investment with available cash  borrowings under our credit facility  and proceeds from the partial settlement of forward equity sales 
excess tax benefits associated with stock options have been reported as financing cash flows in the amount of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
under past acquisition agreements  we are contingently liable  upon achievement of specified financial targets  to make payments of up to million through in  we expect to make total payments of approximately million to settle portions of these contingent arrangements 
in addition  we expect to repurchase approximately million of affiliate equity during our board of directors has periodically authorized share repurchase programs most recently october 
the maximum number of shares that may be repurchased under outstanding programs is approximately million 
the timing and amount of repurchases are determined at the discretion of management 
in  we repurchased million shares for million at an average price per share of we anticipate that borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from the settlement of any forward equity sales  together with cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future

the amount of contingent payments related to investments in affiliates disclosed in the table represents our expected settlement amounts 
the maximum settlement amount through is approximately million and million in periods thereafter 
market risk our revenue is derived primarily from advisory fees which are based on assets under management 
such values are affected by changes in financial markets  and accordingly declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our revenue and net income 
the broader financial markets are also affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
we have fixed rates of interest on our senior notes  our senior convertible notes and on both issues of our junior convertible trust preferred securities 
we pay a variable rate of interest on our credit facility 
while a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities  such a change may affect the fair value of these securities 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would result in a net change in the value of our fixed rate securities of approximately million 
from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into derivative contracts as described on page we estimate that a increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a net increase in the unrealized value of our derivative contracts of approximately million 

table of contents there can be no assurance that our hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
in addition  the valuations of our foreign affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which could be recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
to illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates  as of december   a change in the canadian dollar and british pound to us dollar exchange rates would result in an approximate million change to stockholders equity and a million change to income before income taxes 
during  changes in currency exchange rates increased stockholders equity by million 
recent accounting developments in may  the financial accounting standards board issued an update to the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance 
the new guidance clarifies existing fair value measurement principles and expands certain disclosure requirements  particularly for measurements categorized as level we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance that provides the option of performing a qualitative assessment before proceeding with a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets 
following an assessment of qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived asset is greater than its carrying amount  then a quantitative assessment is unnecessary 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we early adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued an update to the guidance for reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires companies to present in a single note or on the face of the financial statements  the impact of amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
the new guidance is effective for interim and fiscal periods beginning after december  adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 

table of contents these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
we make judgments to determine the fair value of certain assets  liabilities and equity interests when allocating the purchase price of our new investments  when revaluing our contingent payment arrangements  when we issue or repurchase equity interests and when we test our intangible assets or equity and cost method investments for impairment 
in determining fair values  we make assumptions about the growth rates  profitability and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts  and consider historical and current market multiples  tax benefits  credit risk  interest rates and discount rates 
we consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to observed market transactions  and in certain instances consult with third party valuation experts 
goodwill goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized  and is reported within the segments in which the business operates 
our goodwill impairment assessments are performed annually at the reporting unit level in our case  our three operating segments  or more frequently  should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment and no impairments were identified 
for purposes of our assessment  we considered various qualitative factors including market multiples for asset management businesses and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was greater than its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
only a substantial decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units would indicate that an impairment may exist 
indefinite lived intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts between our affiliates and their sponsored registered investment companies 
because the contracts are with the registered investment companies themselves  and not with the underlying investors  and the contracts between our affiliates and the registered investment companies are typically renewed on an annual basis  industry practice under gaap is to consider the contract life to be indefinite and  as a result  not amortizable 
we perform indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we assess each of our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by considering various qualitative factors including market multiples 
during  we determined that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset at one of our affiliates  a manager of growth oriented us equity mutual funds  had declined below its carrying value and  accordingly  we recognized an impairment of million 
the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset was determined by discounting the projected future cash flows associated with the underlying mutual fund contracts such cash flows being dependent upon projected growth 
our discount rates were developed with input from valuation experts 
we also determined that the useful life of this intangible asset was no longer indefinite and  accordingly  we reclassified the remaining acquired client relationships to definite lived 
for our remaining indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each asset was greater than its carrying amount 
only a substantial decline in the fair value would indicate that an impairment may exist 
definite lived intangible assets definite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts between our affiliates and their underlying investors  and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we 
table of contents monitor the useful lives of these assets and revise them  if necessary 
we review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that may influence our projections of the future economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
we are currently amortizing our definite lived intangible assets over an average useful life of approximately eleven years 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a material impact on our amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of each of our definite lived intangible assets by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we perform definite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationships for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows of the acquired relationships 
projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of each of these assets significantly exceed their carrying value and  accordingly  only a substantial decline in the undiscounted cash flows underlying these assets would indicate that an impairment may exist 
equity and cost method investments we evaluate equity and cost method investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other than temporary 
if we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 
for companies with quoted market prices in active markets  we use these prices to determine the fair value of our equity and cost method investments 
for companies without quoted market prices in active markets  we determine the fair values by applying a market multiple to the estimated cash flows of each investment 
our fair value multiples are supported by observed transactions and discounted cash flow analyses which reflect assumptions of current and projected levels of affiliate assets under management  fee rates and estimated expenses 
changes in estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the fair value of these investments 
in the fourth quarter  we completed our evaluation of equity and cost method investments and no impairments were identified 
only a substantial decline in the fair value of any of these investments for a period that is considered other than temporary would indicate that an impairment may exist 
contingent payment arrangements we periodically enter into contingent payment arrangements in connection with our business combinations 
in these arrangements  the company agrees to pay additional consideration to the sellers to the extent that certain levels of revenue growth are achieved 
for consolidated affiliates  we estimate the fair value of these potential future obligations by discounting the projected future payments such estimates being dependent upon projected revenue using current market rates 
our discount rates are developed with input from valuation experts 
our expected lives are determined based on the contractual terms of the underlying arrangements 
we then accrete the obligation to its expected payment amount over the period until the arrangement is measured 
if the expected payment amount subsequently changes  the obligation is reduced or increased in the current period resulting in a gain or loss 
both gains and losses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents changes to our projected future payment amounts could materially affect the amount of imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements we recognize in any period 
for example  a change in our assumed discount rate or a change in our projected revenue assuming all other factors remain constant at affiliates with these types of arrangements  would result in an increase or decrease to our imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements of million and million  respectively 
redeemable non controlling interests redeemable non controlling interests represent the currently redeemable value of our affiliate partners retained equity interests 
we may pay for these affiliate equity purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration  at our election 
we generally value these interests upon their transfer or repurchase by applying market multiples to an affiliate cash flows  which is intended to represent fair value 
the use of different assumptions could change the value of these interests  including the amount of compensation expense  if any  that we may report upon their transfer or repurchase 
income taxes tax regulations often require income and expense to be included in our tax returns in different amounts and in different periods than are reflected in the financial statements 
deferred taxes are established to reflect the differences between the inclusion of items of income and expense in the financial statements and their reporting on our tax returns 
our overall tax position requires analysis to estimate the expected realization of tax assets and liabilities 
additionally  we must assess whether to recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions  and  if so  the appropriate amount of the benefit 
our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax deductible intangible assets and convertible securities 
most of our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments to be taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment 
we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment was approximately million 
during  our convertible securities generated deferred taxes of approximately million because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported interest expense 
these deferred tax liabilities may be reclassified to equity if the securities convert to common stock 
we regularly assess our deferred tax assets in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
our principal deferred tax assets are state operating losses  foreign tax credit carryforwards and the indirect benefits of uncertain foreign tax positions 
in our assessment  we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
as of december   our valuation allowances for state net operating losses and indirect tax benefits from uncertain tax positions were million  and million  respectively 
in our assessment of uncertain tax positions  we consider the probability that a tax authority would sustain our tax position in an examination 
for tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon the ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax positions not meeting this threshold  no benefit is recognized 

table of contents changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans covering directors  senior management and employees 
we calculate share based compensation using the fair value of the awards on the grant date 
our share based compensation plans typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of continued employment 
we recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  including grants that are subject to graded vesting 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options 
in measuring expected volatility  we consider both the historical volatility of our common stock  as well as the current implied volatility from traded securities 
in determining volatility  we have placed less emphasis on periods of high volatility that are not representative of our future expectations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we grant equity interests in our affiliates to our management and affiliate partners from time to time  with vesting  forfeiture and repurchase terms established at the date of grant 
the fair value of the equity interest is determined as of the date of grant using a discounted cash flow analysis 
key valuation assumptions include projected assets under management  fee rates and discount rates 
revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents asset based advisory fees 
our affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees as they render services to their clients 
in addition to generating asset based fees  our affiliates also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance and recognize performance fees when they are earned ie when they become billable to customers 
international operations in connection with our international distribution initiatives  we have offices in sydney  australia  london  england  zurich  switzerland  hong kong  and dubai  united arab emirates 
in addition  we have international operations through affiliates who are based outside of the us or have significant operations outside of the us  or who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non us clients 
in the future  we may open additional offices  or invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the us there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  different and in some cases  less stringent  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our affiliates that have international operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
