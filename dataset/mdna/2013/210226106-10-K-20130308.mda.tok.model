the sales price on this transaction amounted to  as of december   no contract was in place  therefore  this property was not presented as assets held for sale on the balance sheet and the property s operating results were not included in discontinued operations 
our current portfolio of income properties generates approximately million of revenues from lease payments on an annualized basis and has an average remaining lease term of years as of december  we expect to continue to focus on acquiring income producing properties during fiscal  and in the near term thereafter  maintaining our use of the aforementioned tax deferral structure whenever possible 
as of december   the company owned three retail banking sites in florida and georgia  originally leased by rbc centura bank rbc 
in march  rbc s us retail banking unit merged with pnc bank 
the company does not expect the merger to have an adverse impact on the leases for these properties

during the fourth quarter of  rbc closed the branch at one of the retail banking sites owned by the company  located in altamonte springs  florida 
the tenant remains obligated on the lease for the remaining term of the lease and the scheduled lease payments have continued to be collected

real estate operations 
until the significant downturn in the us economy in  the company s land transaction activity had been reasonably strong in the preceding several years 
during  however  land transactions decreased significantly  and in fiscal years and  there were effectively no land transactions 
we believe the trend in company revenues and income from real estate operations during this period were consistent with the overall trend of the national and local economies and the real estate markets in general 
over the last several years  roads and interstate overpasses have been constructed  extended  or improved  in the daytona beach  volusia county area  which we believe will benefit company owned land and may have a positive impact on future activity of our land assets 
in the second quarter of  we completed the sale of acres of industrial land west of interstate at a price of  or  per acre 
the gain on the sale of this land totaled  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview continued historical revenues and income are not indicative of future results because of the unique nature of land transactions and variations in the cost basis of the owned land 
a significant portion of the company s revenue and income in any given year may be generated through relatively large commercial real estate transactions 
the timing for these real estate transactions  from the time of preliminary discussions through contract negotiations  due diligence periods  and the closing  can last from several months to several years 
although we believe there have been recent signals of improvement in the overall economy and credit markets  we do not expect a significant improvement of economic conditions  in particular with the real estate market in the near term  and as a result we believe our ability to enter into land transactions will remain challenging 
during  the company conducted an impairment analysis on approximately acres of land  which had been reacquired in through a foreclosure proceeding 
the analysis resulted in an impairment charge of  the charge represented the entire cost basis of the property as management decided to abandon the property due to the high carrying costs associated with these parcels  as they were subject to the indigo community development district bond issue  relative to the current market environment for undeveloped land 
the company sold substantially all of its interest in this land to a third party for de minimus proceeds and the assumption of approximately  of accrued liabilities  in the fourth quarter of the company owns full or fractional subsurface oil  gas  and mineral interests in approximately  surface acres in florida counties 
our subsurface operations consist of revenue from the leasing of exploration rights and in some instances additional revenues from royalties applicable to production from the leased acreage 
during  an eight year oil exploration lease covering approximately  net mineral acres primarily located in lee and hendry counties was executed and a  first year rental payment was received 
an additional  representing the guaranteed payment for the second year delay rental lease payment  was received in september after the second year of the lease  the company will receive royalty payments if oil production occurs 
alternately  if production does not commence by the third anniversary of the effective date of the lease and the lease is not terminated by the parties at that time  the company will receive additional lease payments based upon the acres remaining under lease 
the company also generates income from the release of surface entry rights 
at december   the company also received oil royalties from operating oil wells on acres under a separate lease with a separate operator 
production volume from these oil wells was  barrels in and  barrels in the company received oil royalties of  in and  in during the first quarter of  the company signed an excavation agreement for fill dirt removal with up to four month excavation periods and received an upfront non refundable payment of  for the first excavation period beginning march  and ending november  through december   we recognized the entire non refundable payment into income 
the income from this excavation agreement was reclassified from other income into real estate operations in the fourth quarter of  and all prior quarterly information has been adjusted accordingly 
golf operations 
golf operations consist of the operation of two hole championship golf courses with a three hole practice facility  a clubhouse facility  and food and beverage activities within the lpga international mixed use residential community on the west side of interstate in daytona beach  florida 
lpga international is a semi private golf club consisting of an hole course designed by rees jones and an hole course designed by arthur hills 
the company leases the land and certain improvements attributable to the golf courses under a long term lease with the city of daytona beach  florida 
due to the continuing losses of the golf operations  the company recorded an impairment charge totaling  before income tax  in the company entered into a management agreement with an affiliate of clubcorp america  effective january   to manage the lpga international golf and clubhouse facilities 
we believe clubcorp  which owns and operates clubs and golf courses worldwide  brings substantial golf and club management expertise and knowledge to the lpga international golf operations  including the utilization of national marketing capabilities  aggregated purchasing programs  and implementation of an affiliate member program  which should improve membership levels through the access to other member clubs in the affiliate program 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with the city of daytona beach  florida the city to  among other things  amend the remaining lease payments under the golf course lease whereby the base rent payment scheduled to increase from  to  as of september   for the remainder of the lease term and any extensions  was kept at  subject to an annual rate increase of beginning september  since the inception of the lease  the company has been recognizing the rent expense on a straight line basis resulting in an estimated accrual for deferred rent equal to  as of december  upon the effective date of the amendment to the lease  the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview continued company s straight line rent was revised to reflect the lower rent levels through expiration of the lease 
as a result  approximately million of the rent previously deferred will not be due  and will be recognized into income over the remaining lease term of years 
as part of the lease amendment  we agreed to invest  of capital improvements to the facilities by september  in december  we completed a renovation of the clubhouse which involved both the remodeling of the primary food and beverage restaurant  as well as the pro shop  for a total cost of approximately  in addition  beginning on september   and continuing throughout the initial lease term and any extension option  the company will pay additional rent to the city in the amounts of of gross revenues exceeding  up to  and of gross revenues exceeding  the lease matures in with seven renewal options for five years each 
other income 
substantially all of our other income consists of revenues generated by our agricultural operations 
the company s agricultural lands encompass approximately  acres on the west side of daytona beach  florida 
our agricultural operations are managed by a third party and consist of leasing land for hay production  timber harvesting  as well as hunting leases
