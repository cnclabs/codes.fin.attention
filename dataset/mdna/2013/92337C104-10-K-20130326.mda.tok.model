item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read the risk factors section of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 

table of contents overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing proprietary small molecule drugs targeting cancer stem cells along with proprietary companion diagnostics 
a cancer stem cell is a particularly aggressive type of tumor cell  resistant to conventional cancer therapy  that we believe is an underlying cause of tumor recurrence and metastasis 
our scientific co founders have made discoveries that link the epithelial to mesenchymal transition  or emt  to the emergence of cancer stem cells 
this transition involves the transformation of one type of cancer cell into a more aggressive and drug resistant type of cancer cell 
building on these discoveries  our scientific co founders developed proprietary technology to create a stable population of cancer stem cells that we use to screen for and identify small molecule compounds that target cancer stem cells 
we expect to initiate multiple clinical trials with our product candidates vs  vs and vs in  including a potentially pivotal trial of vs in mesothelioma 
we commenced active operations in the second half of our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company  business planning  raising capital  acquiring and developing our technology  identifying potential product candidates  undertaking preclinical studies of our most advanced product candidates and  recently  initiating a clinical trial for vs to date  we have not generated any revenues and have financed our operations with net proceeds from the private placement of our preferred stock and our initial public offering 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
our net loss was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december    for the period from august  inception to december  and million for the period from august  inception to december  we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities  particularly as we continue the research and development and initiate clinical trials of  and seek marketing approval for  our product candidates 
in addition  if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates  we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution 
accordingly  we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations 
adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms  we would be forced to delay  reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability  and we may never do so 
financial operations overview revenue to date  we have not generated any revenues 
our ability to generate product revenues  which we do not expect will occur for many years  if ever  will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with our research activities  including our drug discovery efforts  and the development of our therapeutic product candidates and companion diagnostics 
our research and development expenses consist of employee related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel and stock based compensation expense  
table of contents external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties  such as contract research organizations  or cros  manufacturing organizations and consultants  including our scientific advisory board  license fees  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  and laboratory and other supplies 
we expense research and development costs to operations as incurred 
we account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received  rather than when the payment is made 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects 
we do not allocate employee related expenses or depreciation to any particular project 
because all of our development projects are in preclinical development  we do not track research and development costs by project 
the components of our research and development costs are described in more detail in results of operations 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in future periods as we increase the scope and rate of our drug discovery efforts and begin costlier development activities  including clinical trials for our current and additional product candidates in the future 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete development of our product candidates or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows from our product candidates may commence 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our drug discovery efforts and other research and development activities  the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  clinical trial results  the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation expense  in our executive  finance and business development functions 
other general and administrative expenses include allocated facility costs and professional fees for legal  patent  investor and public relations  consulting  insurance premiums  and accounting services 
interest income prior to september   our cash and cash equivalents were invested in non interest bearing accounts 
as a result  we didn t earn interest income until the last three months of accretion of preferred stock prior to the conversion of our preferred stock into  shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in february  our preferred stock was redeemable beginning in at its original issue price plus any declared but unpaid dividends upon a specified vote of the preferred stockholders 
accretion of preferred stock reflects the periodic accretion of issuance costs on our preferred stock to its redemption value 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses and stock based compensation described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on our limited historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
however  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
accrued research and development expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing quotations and contracts  identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
the significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to cros in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced 

table of contents we base our expenses related to cros on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with cros that conduct research and development on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
there may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly 
although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred  our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period 
stock based compensation prior to becoming a public company  we utilized significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of our common stock 
we granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock as determined by the board of directors  with input from management 
the board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock based on a number of objective and subjective factors  including external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the prices at which we sold shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock  the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our common stock at the time and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event  such as an initial public offering or sale of our company 
we utilized various valuation methodologies in accordance with the framework of the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  to estimate the fair value of our common stock 
the methodologies included an asset based approach and the current value method for our initial common stock valuation as of november   the option pricing method utilizing the reverse backsolve method to estimate our underlying equity value as of july  and a methodology that determined an estimated value under an initial public offering scenario and a sale scenario based upon an assessment of the probability of occurrence of each scenario as of september   november   and december  each valuation methodology included estimates and assumptions that required our judgment 
these estimates included assumptions regarding future performance  including the successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials and the time to completing an initial public offering or sale 
significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could have resulted in different fair values of common stock at each valuation date 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for stock options issued to employees based on the grant date fair value of the awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we record stock based compensation expense for stock options issued to non employees based on the estimated fair value of the services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliability measured  based on the vesting date fair value of the awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of the share based awards  including stock options  using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires the use of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the award and expected stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in determining the fair value of share based awards represent management best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change  and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation could be materially different in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on a us 
table of contents treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock option 
because we do not have a sufficient history to estimate the expected term  we use the simplified method as described in sab topic d for estimating the expected term 
the simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering  we lacked company specific historical and implied volatility information 
therefore  we used the historical volatility of a representative group of public biotechnology and life sciences companies with similar characteristics to us 
in  subsequent to our initial public offering  we began to use a blended volatility rate using our own historical volatility and that of a representative group of public biotechnology and life sciences companies with similar characteristics to us 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we also recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
accordingly  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options based on our historical forfeiture rate  adjusted for known trends  and used these rates in developing a future forfeiture rate 
we have also granted performance based stock options with terms that allow the recipients to vest in a specific number of shares based upon the achievement of performance based milestones as specified in the grants 
share based compensation expense associated with these performance based stock options is recognized if the performance condition is considered probable of achievement using management best estimates of the time to vesting for the achievement of the performance based milestones 
if the actual achievement of the performance based milestones varies from our estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially different than what is recorded in the period 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated time to vesting for performance based stock options will be recognized as compensation cost in the period of the revision  and recorded as a change in estimate 
while the assumptions used to calculate and account for share based compensation awards represents management best estimates  these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if revisions are made to our underlying assumptions and estimates  our share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period 
as of december   there was approximately million  million and million of unrecognized share based compensation  net of estimated forfeitures  related to stock options  restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock awards  respectively  which are expected to be recognized over weighted average periods of years  and years  respectively 
the total unrecognized share based compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements located in this annual report on form k for further discussion of share based compensation

all financial information presented after december  has been consolidated and includes the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily related to increased contract research organization expense of 
table of contents million  an increase of million in license fees due to our agreement with pfizer  inc  including expense associated with the issuance of  shares of common stock  an increase of million for personnel costs  including stock based compensation of million  primarily due to a higher fair value of our common stock  an increase of  for laboratory supplies  an increase of  for depreciation due to additional laboratory equipment and  in additional occupancy costs due to a full year of costs associated with our new facility that we occupied in may general and administrative expense

interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was caused by an increase in the average cash balances available for investment and an increase in interest rates earned on investments 
the increase in the average cash balances for investment was primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock in november and net proceeds from our initial public offering in february for most of the year ended december   our cash was deposited in non interest bearing accounts 
accretion of preferred stock 
during  we recorded  of accretion reflecting the periodic accretion of issuance costs associated with our series a  series b and series c preferred stock through the date of our initial public offering when all outstanding shares of preferred stock converted into common stock compared to  for the year ended december  discussion of the year ended december  we were incorporated on august  as a result  our results of operations reflect the year ended december  and the period from august  inception to december  there is no comparable period for research and development expenses

we primarily invest our cash  cash equivalents and investments in a us treasury money market fund  us agency notes and corporate bonds 

table of contents cash flows the following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below 
years ended december  period from august  inception to december  net cash provided by used in net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
the use of cash in all periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non cash charges and favorable changes in the components of working capital 
the increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due to an increase in research and development expenses as we increased our research and development headcount and increased spending on external research and development costs 
the significant increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the period from august  inception to december  is due to an increase in research and development expenses as we increased our research and development headcount  increased spending on external research and development costs and from increases in the balance of accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred rent 
in addition  we commenced operations in august and  as such  the period ended december  reflects only five months of activity 
we expect cash used in operating activities to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we fund our increased research and development activities 
investing activities 
the cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflects the net purchases of investments of million and the purchase of  of property and equipment 
the cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million purchase of investments   purchase of property and equipment and an  increase in restricted cash related to a standby letter of credit issued as a security deposit for our facility lease

table of contents funding requirements we recently initiated a phase b clinical trial for vs in ovarian cancer 
all of our other product candidates are still in preclinical development 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we continue our research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  seek to identify additional product candidates that target cancer stem cells  acquire or in license other products and technologies  initiate additional clinical trials for our product candidates  seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials  ultimately establish a sales  marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval  maintain  expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio  hire additional clinical  quality control and scientific personnel  and add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts 
we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will enable us to fund our current operating plan and capital expenditure requirements into late we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the development of our current product candidates 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  progress  results and costs of compound discovery  preclinical development  laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates  the extent to which we acquire or in license other products and technologies  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the costs of future commercialization activities  including product sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution  for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval  revenue  if any  received from commercial sales of our product candidates  should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications  maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property related claims  and our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms  if at all 
until such time  if ever  as we can generate substantial product revenues  we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings  debt financings  collaborations  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements 
we do not have any committed external source of funds 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership 
table of contents interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted  and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations  strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties  we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies  future revenue streams  research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed  we may be required to delay  limit  reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations license agreements as discussed in note to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we have executed several agreements to license intellectual property 
the license agreements require us to pay upfront license fees and ongoing annual license maintenance fees  totaling a minimum of  per year beginning in up to a maximum amount of  per year beginning in  as well as reimburse certain patent costs incurred by the licensors  as applicable 
we have not included maintenance fees in the table above since the minimum annual payments are perpetual and the agreements are cancelable by us at any time upon prior written notice to the licensor 
in july  we entered into a license agreement with pfizer inc  pfizer  under which pfizer granted us worldwide  exclusive rights to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize products containing certain of pfizer inhibitors of focal adhesion kinase the products for all therapeutic  diagnostic and prophylactic uses in humans 
we have the right to grant sublicenses under the foregoing licensed rights  subject to certain restrictions 
we are solely responsible  at our own expense  for the clinical development of the products  which is to be conducted in accordance with an agreed upon development plan 
we are also responsible for all manufacturing and commercialization activities at our own expense 
pfizer is required to provide us with an initial quantity of clinical supply of one of the products for an agreed upon price 
we made a one time cash payment to pfizer in the amount of million and issued to pfizer  shares of our common stock 
pfizer is also eligible to receive up to million in developmental milestones and up to an additional million based on the successful attainment of regulatory and commercial sales milestones 
pfizer is also eligible to receive high single to mid double digit royalties on future net sales of products 
our royalty obligations with respect to each product in each country begin on the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country  and end on the later of years after the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country or the date of expiration or abandonment of the last claim contained in any issued patent or patent application licensed by pfizer to us that covers the product in that country 
under our drug discovery platform license agreement  which we amended and restated in january  we also have agreed to make milestone payments to the whitehead institute upon achieving various development  regulatory and commercialization milestones 
for each licensed product  we agreed to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of  plus an additional amount for 
table of contents each subsequent approval of additional indications for a maximum number of licensed products 
for each identified product that is not a licensed product  we agreed to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of  plus an additional amount for each subsequent approval of additional indications for a maximum number of identified products 
each type of specified milestone payment is payable only for each of the maximum number of licensed products and the maximum number of identified products  as the case may be  to achieve the applicable milestone 
in addition  a separate milestone payment is due upon the first commercial sale of each licensed product or identified product that is a diagnostic or prognostic test 
a single additional milestone payment is due for the first issuance of licensed patent rights in the united states  the united kingdom  france  germany  spain or italy 
in addition  we have agreed to pay the whitehead institute royalties as a percentage of net sales of licensed products 
the royalty rate is in the low single digits as a percentage of net sales for licensed products that are therapeutics  the mid single digits for licensed products that are diagnostics or prognostics and less than one percent for identified products 
under our license agreement with poniard pharmaceuticals  inc  or poniard  that we entered into in november relating to vs and vs and other compounds covered by a licensed patent right under that agreement that have the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase as a primary mode of action  we paid an upfront license fee and agreed to pay poniard milestone payments of up to an aggregate of  upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones 
we also agreed to issue to poniard a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock upon the first dosing of the first patient in our first phase clinical trial of a licensed product 
the exercise price of such warrant would be equal to the average closing price of our common stock during the five trading days preceding such issue date 
in addition  we agreed to pay low to mid single digit royalties to poniard as a percentage of net sales of licensed products 
under our separate exclusive license agreement with the whitehead institute  or the cancer diagnostic license agreement  which we amended and restated in december  we paid an upfront license fee and agreed to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of  to the whitehead institute upon achieving specified regulatory and commercialization milestones 
in addition  we have agreed to pay the whitehead institute royalties as a percentage of net sales of licensed products 
the royalty rate is in the mid single digits as a percentage of net sales 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under securities and exchange commission rules 
tax loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million  which are available to reduce future taxable income 
we also had federal tax credits of  and state tax credits of  which may be used to offset future tax liabilities 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and state tax authorities and may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three year period in excess of  as defined under sections and of the internal revenue code  as well as similar state provisions 
this could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of our company immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years 
at december   we recorded a valuation allowance against our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  as we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be fully realized 
in the future  if we 
table of contents determine that a portion or all of the tax benefits associated with our tax carryforwards will be realized  net income would increase in the period of determination 
recently adopted accounting standards we have not recently adopted any new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million as of december   consisting of cash  money market funds  and united states treasuries and federal agency bonds 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our investments are in short term securities 
our available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short term duration most of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
we contract with cros and contract manufacturers globally 
we may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
as of december  and  approximately  and  of our total liabilities was denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  respectively
