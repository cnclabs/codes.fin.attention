table of contents net sales increased million to  million in compared to million in as we experienced volume increases in each of our segments 
supply technologies sales increased primarily due to volume increases in the heavy duty truck  recreational  computer office equipment  consumer electronics and lawn and garden industries  which were offset primarily by declines in the appliance  semi conductor  hvac and instruments industries 
assembly components sales increased  primarily from sales of million resulting from the acquisition of frs and increased sales in the rubber products business unit  offset by lower sales in the aluminum business unit

table of contents our net operating loss carryforward precluded the payment of most us federal income taxes in both and at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire between and liquidity and sources of capital as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  approximately million of unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents of million 
our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our long term debt securities 
on april   we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of notes 
the notes bear an interest rate of per annum and will be payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year commencing october  the notes mature on april  in  we entered into the credit agreement with a group of banks which  as subsequently amended  matures at april  and  as amended  currently provides for a revolving credit facility with availability of up to million subject to an asset based formula and a term loan for million that is secured by certain accounts receivable  inventory  real estate and machinery and equipment 
we have the option to increase the availability under the revolving loan portion of the credit facility by million 
the revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all our accounts receivable and inventory in the united states and canada 
borrowings from this revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be borrowed at either i libor plus to or ii the bank s prime lending rate minus 
to  at our election 
the libor based interest rate is dependent on our debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  a detailed borrowing base formula provides borrowing availability to us based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
interest on the term loan is at either i libor plus or ii the bank s prime lending rate plus 
at our election 
the term loan is amortized based on a seven year schedule with the balance due at maturity april  
current financial resources working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet current cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving loan portion of the credit facility is based on our ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant  which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends 
failure to meet the debt service ratio could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings 
we may from time to time seek to refinance  retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
we may also repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
any such actions will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets may adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future 
these market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to grow and maintain its business 
accordingly  we may be forced to delay raising capital or pay unattractive interest rates  which could increase our interest expense  decrease our profitability and significantly reduce its financial flexibility 

table of contents we had cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries of million and million at december  and  respectively 
for each of our foreign subsidiaries  we make a determination regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment  with the balance  if any  available to be repatriated to the united states 
the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the foreign subsidiaries operational activities and or future foreign investments 
at december   management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the united states  and it is our current intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states 
we have no intention to repatriate the approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december  if we were to repatriate these earnings  there would potentially be an adverse tax impact 
at december   our debt service coverage ratio was  and  therefore  we were in compliance with the debt service ratio covenant contained in the credit agreement 
we were also in compliance with the other covenants contained in the credit agreement as of december  the debt service coverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and is based on the most recently ended four fiscal quarters of consolidated ebitda minus cash taxes paid  minus unfunded capital expenditures  plus cash tax refunds to consolidated debt charges that are consolidated cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments on indebtedness plus scheduled reductions in our term debt as defined in the credit agreement 
the debt service coverage ratio must be greater than and not less than for any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
while we expect to remain in compliance throughout  declines in sales volumes in could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants 
additionally  to the extent our customers are adversely affected by declines in the economy in general  they may not be able to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all  which would make the accounts receivable ineligible for purposes of the revolving credit facility and could reduce our borrowing base and our ability to borrow under such facility 
we expect to remain in compliance throughout the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  versus at december  working capital  which we define as current assets less current liabilities  decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  accounts receivable increased million to million in from million in primarily resulting from the acquisition of frs and its million of accounts receivable at december  and the increase in sales volume in inventory increased by million in to million from million in primarily resulting from the acquisition of frs 
accounts payable increased million to million in from million in as a result of acquiring the accounts payable of frs of million offset by the timing of payments at december  accrued expenses increased by million to million in from million in primarily from acquiring the accrued liabilities of frs of million  offset by a decrease in advance billings of million 
during  we provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily the result of a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities excluding acquisitions of businesses of million in compared to decreases of million in  an increase in net income of million and an increase in deferred taxes of million 
during  we invested million for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and million in capital expenditures  which were offset by the receipt of million from the sale and leaseback of equipment under operating leases 
these activities  plus a net increase in borrowings of million  offset by purchases of our common stock of million  resulted in a decrease in cash of million in

these activities  plus cash interest and tax payments of million  a net increase in borrowings of million  the issuance of the notes  and purchases of treasury stock of million  resulted in an increase in cash of million in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
there are occasions whereupon we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar 
at december   none were outstanding 
we currently have no other derivative instruments

the calculation of interest on debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and other variable rate debt million based on average interest rate and outstanding borrowings of million at december  is not included above due to the subjectivity and estimation required 
postretirement obligations include projected postretirement benefit payments to participants only through the table above excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits disclosed in note h to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability  the timing of potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
we expect that funds provided by operations plus available borrowings under our revolving credit facility to be adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect amounts 
table of contents reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  other than from long term contracts  when title is transferred to the customer  typically upon shipment 
revenue from long term contracts approximately of consolidated revenue is accounted for under the percentage of completion method  and recognized on the basis of the percentage each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated contract cost 
revenue earned on contracts in process that are in excess of billings  is classified in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
billings that are in excess of revenue earned on contracts in process are classified in accrued expenses on the accompanying balance sheet 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectable in the future 
allowances are developed by the individual operating units based on historical losses  adjusting for economic conditions 
our policy is to identify and reserve for specific collectability concerns based on customers financial condition and payment history 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity  which is compared to estimated future usage and sales 
inventories identified by management as slow moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs 
though we consider these allowances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have a material effect on reserve allowances required 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant and equipment  management performs impairment tests of long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life of the asset has changed 
we reviewed our long lived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to idle certain facilities and consolidate certain operations  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset and the expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
when we identified impairment indicators  we determined whether the carrying amount of our long lived assets was recoverable by comparing the carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
we considered whether impairments existed at the lowest level of independent identifiable cash flows within a reporting unit for example  plant location  program level or asset level 
if the carrying value of the assets exceeded the expected cash flows  we estimated the fair value of these assets by using appraisals or recent selling experience in selling similar assets or for certain assets with reasonably predictable cash flows by performing discounted cash flow analysis using the same discount rate used as the weighted average cost of capital in the respective goodwill impairment analysis to estimate fair 
table of contents value when market information was not available to determine whether an impairment existed 
certain assets were abandoned and written down to scrap or appraised value 
we recorded million of asset impairment charges in based on appraisals and scrap values 
see note o to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
restructuring we recognize costs in accordance with asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in the estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the changes 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  management performs impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived assets at least annually  as of october of each year  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
step one compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  step two is performed  where the reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  impairment exists and must be recognized 
in accordance with asc  management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment pursuant to asc  segment reporting  or one level below the operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics 
during  we adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
based on a review of various qualitative factors  management concluded that the goodwill for the capital equipment reporting unit was not impaired and that the two step approach was not required to be performed for this reporting unit 
based on a review of various qualitative factors  management concluded that the goodwill for the aluminum products reporting unit would be tested under the two step approach 
we prepare the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
management determined fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for the reporting unit 
if the calculated fair value is less than the carrying value  impairment of the reporting unit may exist 
the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing in the absence of available domestic and international transactional market evidence to determine the fair value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates are determined by using the weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology 
the wacc considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the discount rate utilized for the aluminum reporting unit was which is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 
operational management  considering industry and company specific historical and projected data  develops growth rates and cash flow projections 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long term growth rates 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that no impairment existed 

table of contents in  we completed the acquisitions of frs and etm and recorded additional goodwill of million 
at december   we had goodwill of million 
in  based on a review of various qualitative factors  management concluded that the goodwill related to the aluminum products  frs and the capital equipment reporting units was not impaired and that the two step approach was not required to be performed 
at december   we had one indefinite lived tradename related to the acquisition of frs in the amount of million 
for purposes of impairment testing  we estimated the fair value of the trade name using a relief from royalty approach 
this approach involves two steps estimating a reasonable royalty rate for the trade name and applying this royalty rate to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the trade name 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that no impairment existed 
income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates 
specifically  we measure gross deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards  such as operating losses and tax credits  using the applicable enacted tax rates and apply the more likely than not measurement criterion 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we and our subsidiaries have pension plans  principally noncontributory defined benefit or noncontributory defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trends 
pension plan asset performance in the future will directly impact our net income 
we have evaluated our pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions  considering current trends in interest rates and market conditions and believe our assumptions are appropriate 
stock based compensation asc  compensation stock compensation  requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes a fair value measurement objective in determining the value of such a cost 
we recorded expense related to stock based compensation in   and of million  million and million before tax  respectively 
accounting guidance issued but not adopted as of december  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement 
the objective of the disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of us gaap and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of ifrs 
in january  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which clarifies the scope of the offsetting disclosures of asu both asus are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after january  retrospective presentation for all comparative periods presented is required 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  entities are required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  entities are required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail on these amounts 
this asu is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance 
environmental we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at third party sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state laws  which provide for strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability 
we are participating in the cost of certain clean up efforts at several of these sites 
however  our share of such costs has not been material and based on available information  our management does not expect our exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we have been named as one of many defendants in a number of asbestos related personal injury lawsuits 
our cost of defending such lawsuits has not been material to date and  based upon available information  our management does not expect our future costs for asbestos related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we caution  however  that inherent in management s estimates of our exposure are expected trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors that may materially vary as claims are filed and settled or otherwise resolved 
seasonality  variability of operating results the timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with  among other factors  orders for customers finished goods  customer production schedules  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the variability of the level and timing of orders has  from time to time  resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our business units 
such variability is particularly evident at the capital equipment businesses  included in the engineered products segment
