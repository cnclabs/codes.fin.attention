the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview pennantpark investment corporation is a bdc whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments primarily in us middle market companies in the form of senior secured loans  mezzanine debt and equity investments 
we believe middle market companies offer attractive risk reward to investors due to the limited amount of capital available for such companies 
we seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes senior secured loans  mezzanine debt and equity investments by investing approximately million to million of capital  on average  in the securities of middle market companies 
we expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base 
we use the term middle market to refer to companies with annual revenues between million and billion 
the companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged  and  in most cases  are not rated by national rating agencies 
if such companies were rated  we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade between bb and ccc under the standard poor s system from the national rating agencies 
our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to us and  to a limited extent  non us corporations  partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions 
our investment activity depends on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
we have used  and expect to continue to use our credit facility  sba debentures  proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives 
organization and structure of pennantpark investment corporation pennantpark investment corporation  a maryland corporation organized in january  is a closed end  externally managed  non diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a bdc under the act

our sbic funds objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing with us in sba eligible businesses that meet the investment criteria used by pennantpark investment 
our investment activities are managed by the investment adviser 
under our investment management agreement  we have agreed to pay our investment adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance 
pennantpark investment  through the investment adviser  provides similar services to our sbic funds under their investment management agreements 
our sbic funds investment management agreements do not affect the management and incentive fees on a consolidated basis 
we have also entered into an administration agreement with the administrator 
under our administration agreement  we have agreed to reimburse the administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the administrator in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs

our board of directors  a majority of whom are independent of us  supervises our activities  and the investment adviser manages our day to day activities 
revenues we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold and capital gains and distributions  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of senior secured loans or mezzanine debt  typically have terms of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or a floating rate 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments and pik interest 
the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of amendment  commitment  origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees 
loan origination fees  oid  and market discount or premium are capitalized  and we accrete or amortize such amounts as income 
we record prepayment penalties on loans and debt securities as income 
dividend income  if any  is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees to our investment adviser  our allocable portion of overhead under our administration agreement and other operating costs as detailed below 
our management fee compensates our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  consummating and monitoring our investments 
additionally  we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt and unused commitment fees under our various debt facilities 
we bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including the cost of calculating our nav  including the cost of any third party valuation services  the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities  fees payable to third parties relating to  or associated with  making investments  including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complimentary businesses  expenses incurred by the investment adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts  federal and state registration fees and any exchange listing fees  federal  state and local taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  brokerage commissions  fidelity bond  directors and officers  errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums  direct costs such as printing  mailing  long distance telephone and staff  fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs  costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the act  the act and applicable federal and state securities laws  and all other expenses incurred by either the administrator or us in connection with administering our business  including payments under our administration agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead  and other expenses incurred by the administrator in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
during periods of asset growth  we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above

critical accounting policies the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation 
we have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions 
references to asc serve as a single source of literature 
subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued 
changes in the economic and regulatory environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments our investments generally consist of illiquid securities  including debt and equity investments 
our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available 
we obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers  if available  or otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
the investment adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers 
if our board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment  it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available 
investments of sufficient credit quality purchased within days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates fair value 
we expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments which are or will be in our portfolio  and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy described in this report and a consistently applied valuation process 
with respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value  the factors that the board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include  as relevant  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the price used in an actual transaction may differ from our valuation and the difference could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of our investment adviser  our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment 
the independent valuation firms review management s preliminary valuations in light of its own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service  broker  dealer or market maker  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the investment adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis  periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms  and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments  and our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith  based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
fair value  as defined under asc  is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability 
asc emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  including assumptions about risk 
inputs may be observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies level inputs that are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by us at the measurement date 
level inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term  if applicable  of the financial instrument 
level inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability 

table of contents a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
generally  most of our investments and our credit facility are classified as level due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material 
in addition to using the above inputs in cash equivalents  investments  the notes and our credit facility valuations  we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with asc consistent with our valuation policy  we evaluate the source of inputs  including any markets in which our investments are trading  in determining fair value 
we adopted asc  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value  and made an irrevocable election to apply asc to our credit facility and our notes 
we elected to use the fair value option for the credit facility and the notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes 
due to that election and in accordance with gaap  we incurred million  million and zero debt issuance costs during the year ended september   and  respectively 
asc establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value 
asc also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities and changes in fair value of the credit facility and notes are reported in our consolidated statement of operations 
we elected not to apply asc to any other financial assets or liabilities  including the sba debentures 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  our credit facility and notes had a net change in unrealized depreciation appreciation of million and million  respectively 
as of september  and  net unrealized depreciation on our credit facility and notes totaled million and million  respectively 
we use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to fair value our credit facility in a manner consistent with the valuation process that the board of directors approves to value investments 
our notes trade on the nyse and we use the closing price on the exchange to determine their fair value 
revenue recognition we record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and debt investments with contractual pik interest which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will generally not accrue pik interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such pik interest is not collectible 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect such interest 
loan origination fees  oid  market discount or premium and deferred financing costs are capitalized and we then accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income or expense  as applicable  using the effective interest method 
we record contractual prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income 
dividend income  if any  is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  using the specific identification method  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
payment in kind interest or pik we have investments in our portfolio which contain a pik interest provision 
pik interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income 
for us to maintain our status as a ric  substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we have not collected any cash with respect to pik securities 
federal income taxes we have elected to be taxed  and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be taxed  as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to maintain our ric tax election  we must  among other requirements  meet certain source of income and quarterly asset diversification requirements 
we also must annually distribute at least of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
although not required for us to maintain our ric tax status  in order to preclude the imposition of a nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on rics  we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our net ordinary income for the calendar year  of the sum of our net capital gains income ie the excess  if any  of our capital gains over capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and the sum of any net ordinary income plus net capital gain income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
in addition  although we may distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above  we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or net ordinary income to provide us with additional liquidity 
because federal income tax regulations differ from gaap  distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes 
differences may be permanent or temporary 
permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their tax character 
temporary differences arise when certain items of income  expense  gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future

our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur 
we have used  and expect to continue to use  our debt capital and proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives 
we have a million multi currency credit facility with certain lenders and suntrust bank  acting as administrative agent  and jpmorgan chase bank  na  acting as syndication agent for the lenders

the credit facility is a four year revolving facility with a stated maturity date of february  and a one year term out period following its third year 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at basis points over libor 
as of september  and  we had million and million of unused borrowing capacity  respectively  subject to the regulatory restrictions that the act imposes on us as a bdc 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by our sbic funds 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants  including maintenance of a minimum stockholders equity of the sum of a million plus b of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in us and our subsidiaries after the closing date of the credit facility and maintenance of a ratio of total assets less total liabilities other than indebtedness to total indebtedness of not less than before any exemptive relief granted by the sec with respect to the indebtedness of our sbic subsidiaries 
in addition to the asset coverage ratio described in the preceding sentence  borrowings under our credit facility and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the company s portfolio 
for a complete list of covenants contained in the credit facility  see our form k filed on february  and the credit facility agreement filed as an exhibit to our form q filed on may  as of september   we were in compliance with the terms of our credit facility

table of contents for the fiscal year ended september  we sold million shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters exercise of the overallotment option  resulting in net proceeds of million 
this compares to selling million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of million for the fiscal year ended september  any decision to sell shares below the then current nav per share of our common stock is subject to stockholder approval and a determination by our board of directors that such issuance and sale is in our and our stockholders best interests

as of september   we excluded the principal amounts of our sba debentures from our asset coverage ratio pursuant to sec exemptive relief 
in june  we received exemptive relief from the sec allowing us to modify the asset coverage ratio requirement to exclude the sba debentures from the calculation 
accordingly  our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than  which while providing increased investment flexibility  also increases our exposure to risks associated with leverage

pennantpark investment  through the administrator  provides similar services to our sbic funds under their administration agreements  which are intended to have no effect on the consolidated administration fee 
if requested to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies  pennantpark investment advisers or pennantpark investment administration will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided  which amount will not in any case exceed the amount we receive from the portfolio companies for such services 
payment under our administration agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent  technology systems  insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
if any of our contractual obligations discussed above is terminated  our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase 
in addition  we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our investment management agreement and our administration agreement 
any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders 
we  in the ordinary course of business  have guaranteed certain obligations of sph 
the guaranties are only triggered if there were administrative errors in acquiring assets which sph subsequently sold or securitized 
as of september  our maximum guaranty is million 
based on sph s and industry historical loss rates we believe the risk of loss is remote  thus  we have not recorded a liability associated with the guaranties 
the current guaranties will decline over time 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently engage in no off balance sheet arrangements  including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices 
distributions in order to qualify as a ric and to not be subject to corporate level tax on income  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute annually at least of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
although not required for us to maintain our ric tax status  in order to preclude the imposition of a nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on rics  we may distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our net ordinary income for the calendar year  of our realized net capital gains for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
in addition  although we may distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may retain such net capital gains or ordinary income to provide us with additional liquidity 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  we elected to retain a portion of our calendar year income and incurred an excise tax of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended september   and  we declared distributions of  and per share  respectively  for total distributions of million  million and million  respectively 
we monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for taxation purposes may occur for the fiscal year 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed to be a return of capital to our common stockholders 
tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on form div after the end of the calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the sec 
we intend to continue to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders 
our quarterly distributions  if any  are determined by our board of directors 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a distribution  then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a bdc under the act and or due to provisions in future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of ric status 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
as of september   our debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate investments and variable rate investments including with a libor or prime floor 
the variable rate loans are usually based on a libor rate and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
variable rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor 
in regards to variable rate instruments with a floor  we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor 
in contrast  our cost of funds  to the extent it is not fixed  will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
assuming that the most recent statement of assets and liabilities was to remain constant  and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates 
change in interest rates change in interest income  net of interest expense per share up up up up although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market  credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations  or net investment income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act and applicable commodities laws 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates 
during the periods covered by this report  we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
