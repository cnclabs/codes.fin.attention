table of contents merchant services overview our merchant acquiring services are similar around the world in that we accept a variety of card and electronic based payments at the point of sale 
our primary business model provides payment products and services directly to merchants as our end customers 
we also provide similar products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of isos that  in turn  resell our products and services  in which case  the financial institutions and select isos are our end customers 
these particular services are marketed in the united states  canada  and parts of eastern europe 
we provide our merchant customers with the ability to accept check  card and electronic based payments 
the term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services 
we sell our services through multiple sales channels around the world and target customers in many vertical industries 
card based payment forms consist of credit  debit  gift  stored value  and electronic benefits transfer cards 
credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of the world major international card brands  including american express  china unionpay  discover  jcb  mastercard  visa and non traditional payment methods  as well as certain domestic debit networks  such as interac in canada 
electronic payment processing involves a consumer or cardholder acquiring goods or services from a merchant and using a credit or debit card or other electronic method as the form of payment 
we are the processing intermediary between the merchant  the credit and debit networks and the financial institutions that issue cards 
our comprehensive offerings include terminal sales and deployment  front end authorization processing  settlement and funding processing  full customer support and help desk functions  chargeback resolution  industry compliance  pci security  consolidated billing and statements  and on line reporting 
our value proposition is to provide high quality  responsive  secure and full end to end service to all of our customers 
currently  we focus on merchant customers in the united states  canada  brazil  the united kingdom  spain  the republic of malta  the czech republic  the russian federation and the asia pacific region 
the majority of merchant services revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction  depending on card type 
we also charge other fees based on specific services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value 
credit and debit card transaction processing credit and debit networks establish uniform regulations that govern much of the payment card industry 
during a typical card transaction  the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other  but instead rely on merchant acquirers 
merchant acquirers are typically financial institutions or independent processors like global payments 
global payments performs a series of services including authorization  electronic draft capture  file transfers to facilitate funds settlement and certain exception based  back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 
in order to provide credit and signature based debit card transaction processing services for mastercard and visa  we must either be a member of these systems or be designated as a certified processor by mastercard and visa in addition to being a merchant service provider by mastercard and an independent sales organization by visa 
currently  these designations are dependent upon member clearing banks of either organization sponsoring us and our adherence to the standards of the mastercard and visa networks 
a financial institution that is a member of the mastercard and visa card networks which we refer to in this discussion as member must sponsor an electronic transaction payment processor such as global payments 
we have financial institution sponsors in the various markets where we facilitate payment transactions with whom we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements 
these agreements allow us to route transactions under the member banks control and identification numbers to clear credit card transactions through mastercard and visa 
certain of the member financial institutions of mastercard and visa are our competitors 
mastercard and visa set the standards with which we must comply 
in certain markets  we are members in various payment networks  allowing us to process and fund transactions without third party financial institution sponsorship 
we intend to pursue memberships in additional markets in the future 
in many markets we also provide credit card transaction processing for discover financial services or discover card discover and are designated as an acquirer by discover 
this designation provides us with a direct relationship between us and discover  and therefore a member sponsorship is not required 
our agreement with discover allows us to route and clear transactions directly through discover network 
otherwise  we process discover transactions similarly to the way we process mastercard and visa transactions 
discover publishes acquirer operating regulations with which we must comply 
we use our members to assist in funding merchants for discover transactions 
additionally  we provide credit and debit card transaction processing for china unionpay cup in selected markets and through a variety of methods  and are either designated as an acquirer by china unionpay or are sponsored by a china unionpay member institution 
china unionpay publishes acquirer operating regulations with which we must comply 
we use our members to assist in funding merchants for china unionpay transactions 

table of contents how a card transaction works a typical card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a point of sale pos terminal card reader or mobile phone card reader  which may be sold  leased  or rented  and serviced by global payments 
alternatively  card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device by one of a number of products that we offer directly or through a value added reseller var 
the terminal electronically records sales draft information  such as the card identification number  transaction date and value of the goods or services purchased 
after the card and transaction information is captured by the pos device  the terminal automatically either dials a pre programmed phone number or otherwise connects to our network through the internet or other communication channels in order to receive authorization of the transaction 
for a credit card transaction  authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits 
in a debit card transaction  the company obtains authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the payment network verifying that the cardholder has sufficient funds for the transaction 
timing differences  interchange expense  merchant reserves and exception items cause differences between the amount the member receives from the card networks and the amount funded to the merchants 
the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds  and  instead  require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant is funded 
however  in practice and in accordance with the terms of our sponsorship agreements with our members  we generally follow a net settlement process by region whereby  if the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member funding obligation to the merchant  we temporarily hold the surplus on behalf of the member  in an account at the member bank  and record a corresponding liability 
conversely  if the member funding obligation to the merchant precedes the incoming amount from the card networks  the amount of the member net receivable position is either subsequently advanced to the member by us or the member satisfies this obligation with its own funds 
if the member uses its own funds  the member may assess a funding cost 
each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for its services 
as an illustration  shown below  on a credit card transaction  the card issuer may fund the member after retaining approximately referred to as an interchange fee or interchange expense 
the card issuer seeks reimbursement of from the cardholder in the cardholder monthly credit card bill 
the member would  in turn  pay the merchant 
the net settlement after this transaction would require global payments to advance the member 
after the end of the month  we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction  or discount  to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our net revenue from the transaction 
if our discount rate for the merchant in the above example was  we would bill the merchant at the end of the month for the transaction  reimburse ourselves for approximately in interchange fees and retain or as our net revenue for the transaction 
discount rates vary based on negotiations with merchants and the economic characteristics of transactions 
interchange also varies based on the economic characteristics of individual transactions 
accordingly  our net revenue per transaction varies across our merchant base and is subject to change based on changes in discount rates and interchange rates 
our profit on the transaction reflects the net revenue less operating expenses  including assessments and other network fees  systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or iso 
assessments are fees charged by visa and mastercard based on the dollar value of transactions processed through their networks

business segments north america merchant services segment north america merchant services revenues represent of our total consolidated fiscal revenues and includes operations in the united states  canada and brazil 
in the united states  we sell our services via isos  a direct sales force  trade associations  integrated payment technology  agent and var referral arrangements  as well as proprietary telesales groups 
our iso channel targets a variety of merchant types with typical annual bankcard volumes of  or less 
the isos contract with global payments to provide processing and other services depending on the isos requirements 
these contracts are multi year and priced by service on a per transaction basis 
the isos act as a third party sales group selling global payments branded merchant acquiring products and services  with the majority of global payments isos marketing direct merchant acquiring 
because global payments is a primary party to the merchant contract as a result of our bank sponsor relationship  the full amount of fees collected from the merchant  net of interchange  is recorded as revenue 
the excess of revenue earned over our cost to process the transaction plus the iso contractual transaction fee is remitted to the iso in the form of a residual payment on a monthly basis and is recorded in sales  general and administrative expenses 
our direct sales channel receives qualified leads from our agent bank  var and trade association referral partners signing a variety of mid to large sized merchants with annual bankcard volume on average above  our merchant portfolio is also increased by targeted campaigns and other lead generating efforts by our direct sales force 
our sales force is paid a combination of base salary and commission 
our referral partners are paid various referral fees 
our integrated payment technologies channel  or apt  sells integrated payment solutions to more than different vertical markets gaining market share by signing new enterprise solution providers and by signing new merchants within existing enterprise solution providers already supported by apt 
our united states revenue also includes check and gaming services and indirect merchant services 
our check products offer merchant customers risk management alternatives  in the case of our verification and recovery offerings  or risk elimination  in the case of our guarantee offerings  by leveraging our internal and external databases of checkwriters to help decide whether 
table of contents the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter 
our check services products are part of our direct merchant service offering 
the majority of check services involve providing check guarantee services for checks received by merchants 
under the guarantee service  when a merchant receives a check in payment for goods and services  the transaction is submitted and analyzed by the company 
the company either accepts or declines the check for warranty coverage under its guarantee service 
if the company approves the check for warranty coverage and the merchant accepts the check  the merchant will either deposit the check in its bank account or process it for settlement through the company electronic check acceptance service 
if the check is returned unpaid by the merchant bank and the returned check meets the requirements for warranty coverage  the company is required to purchase the check from the merchant at its face value 
the company then owns the purchased check and pursues collection of the check from the check writer 
as a result  the company bears the risk of loss if the company is unable to collect the returned check from the check writer 
we earn a fee for each check guaranteed  which generally is determined as a percentage of the check amount 
in the specialized vertical market of gaming  our vip lightspeed proprietary software and vip preferred advantage product provide the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for a casino customers 
our gaming products allow fast access to cash with high limits so that gaming establishments can increase the flow of money to their gaming floors and reduce risk 
we derive revenue from our gaming products primarily based on a percentage of the transaction value 
in the indirect merchant services channel we provide merchant services to financial institutions and a limited number of isos that  in turn  resell our products and services 
international merchant services segment international merchant services revenues represent of our total consolidated fiscal revenues and include operations in europe and the asia pacific region 
our business in europe is primarily located in the united kingdom  spain  the republic of malta  czech republic  and the russian federation 
our asia pacific region includes the following eleven countries and territories brunei  china  hong kong  india  macau  malaysia  maldives  the philippines  singapore  sri lanka and taiwan 
we have a direct sales force in the united kingdom  spain  the republic of malta  the russian federation and the asia pacific region through which we primarily sell our direct merchant acquiring services while leveraging our bank referral relationships 
in the czech republic and the russian federation we also provide indirect merchant acquiring services 
total revenues from our segments  by geography  are as follows in thousands year ended may  revenues united states canada north america merchant services europe asia pacific international merchant services consolidated revenues industry overview payment processing service providers offer electronic transaction payment processing and support services directly to merchants  multinational corporations  financial institutions and isos 
we are a leading mid market and small market merchant acquirer in the united states and we primarily compete with first data corporation  bank of america merchant services  chase paymentech  wells fargo  vantiv  heartland payment systems and elavon 

table of contents in canada  we have significant market share 
we consider moneris solutions  chase paymentech solutions and td merchant services to be major competitors in the canadian market 
moneris solutions is a joint venture between the royal bank of canada and the bank of montreal 
in the european and asia pacific regions  financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment processing services to merchants  although the outsourcing of merchant processing services to third party service providers is becoming more prevalent 
processing services have become increasingly complex  requiring significant capital commitments to develop  maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price 
in spain  we hold the number one market share position and our primary competitors are banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria  s 
a  caja madrid  santander  and banco popular although all banks offer some form of card processing in line with the traditional full service model in the market 
in the united kingdom  we believe we hold the number three market position compared to our primary competitors worldpay and barclays 
in spain  we hold the number one market share position and our primary competitors are banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria  s 
a and caja madrid  although all banks offer some form of card processing in line with the traditional full service model in the market 
while we have a market leading position with our partner caixabank  we are expecting similar models to become more prevalent as further consolidation occurs in the banking sector 
we believe we hold the number one market share position amongst non bank processors in the russian federation in a highly fragmented payments market 
our competition is made up of various financial institutions  including sberbank  vtb  raiffeisen bank  and russian standard bank 
in the czech republic  our primary competitors are first data  sinsys  and euronet 
in the asia pacific region  our primary competition is from financial institutions that offer merchant acquiring services in each of our eleven markets 
as a result of continued growth in our industry  several large merchant acquirers  including us  have expanded operations both domestically and internationally in the form of acquisitions and the creation of alliances and joint ventures 
we believe that the electronic payment transaction processing industry will continue to consolidate as banks and independent processors that do not have the necessary infrastructure may look to exit the business 
we believe that electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies 
to help reduce transaction costs and accelerate the transaction approval process  we have integrated new technologies into our service offerings such as internet protocol communications and check truncation or conversion at the point of sale 
in order to support and integrate payments into our merchants various business solutions utilized through vars  we created a developer portal simplifying the payment enablement process with multiple vars 
we are also able to offer our customers integrated e commerce solutions 
through our var relationships  we have several products that support radio frequency identification for contactless payment cards as well as near field communication enabled smartphones that contain mobile wallet software  which position global payments to participate in mobile payments 
we also offer customers the ability to accept payments utilizing a mobile device as a point of sale terminal 
as mobile payments continue to evolve and are desired by merchants and consumers  we intend to continue partnering and developing new products and services that will leverage the benefits that these new technologies can offer our customers 
we also believe that new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper based transactions 
industries such as e commerce  healthcare  education  government  recurring payments  and business to business should continue to see transaction volumes migrate to more electronic based settlement solutions 
we believe that the continued development of new products and services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business for the foreseeable future 
strategy we seek to leverage the adoption of  and transition to  card and electronic based payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels and through acquisitions and also enter new markets through acquisitions around the world 
we intend to continue to invest in and leverage our technology infrastructure and our people to increase our penetration in existing markets

in addition  because we provide data processing services to banks and other financial institutions  we are subject to examination by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
set forth below is a brief summary of some of the significant laws and regulations that apply to the company 
these descriptions are not exhaustive and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision 
the dodd frank act on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act  which has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act directed the board of governors of the federal reserve board to regulate the debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment card network receives or charges for an electronic debit transaction 
the act requires that these fees be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing  clearing and settling the transaction 
on june   the board announced the final rules governing debit card interchange fees  and routing and exclusivity restrictions 
under these rules  debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of billion or more 
table of contents are capped at per transaction and an ad valorem component of basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer fraud losses plus  for qualifying issuers  an additional per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs 
in addition  the rules contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card  prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements  and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements 
the interchange fee limitations and prohibition on merchant routing restrictions took effect on october  the prohibition on network exclusivity arrangements took effect on october  for payment card networks and april  for most debit card issuers 
in addition  the prohibition on network exclusivity arrangements were effective for certain health and benefit cards and general use prepaid cards on april the dodd frank act also created the financial stability oversight council fsoc  which was established to  among other things  identify risks to the stability of the us financial system 
the fsoc has the authority to require supervision and regulation of nonbank financial companies by the federal reserve if the fsoc determines either that i material financial distress at the nonbank financial company or ii the nature  scope  size  scale  concentration  interconnectedness  or mix of activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states 
such companies  commonly known as systemically important financial institutions or sifis  will be subject to heightened prudential standards such as risk based capital requirements  liquidity requirements  and short term debt limits 
in june  the fsoc reportedly voted on its first set of proposed sifis  though such designated companies are not publicly disclosed 
the fsoc has not publicly designated the company as a proposed sifi 
additionally  the fsoc has the authority to designate financial market utilities fmus and financial institutions engaged in payment  clearing and settlement pcs activities as systemically important if the fsoc determines that failure or disruption to the functioning of the fmu or conduct of the pcs activities could threaten the stability of the us financial system 
such a designation will subject the fmu or financial institution to oversight and risk management standards established by the federal reserve in consultation with the fsoc and certain other applicable regulatory agencies 
early indications suggest that the fsoc is focused on the regulation of financial services companies that operate unregulated wholesale transfer systems or engage in largely unregulated commodities  derivatives and currency markets  and not on entities such as the company 
payment network rules we are subject to the rules of mastercard  visa  discover  china unionpay and interac  and other payment networks 
in order to provide our transaction processing services  several of our subsidiaries are registered with mastercard and visa as service providers for member institutions and with other networks

the ffiec examines large data processors in order to identify and mitigate risks associated with systemically significant service providers  including specifically the risks they may pose to the banking industry 
in addition  we are subject to directive ec in the european union the payment services directive  which was implemented in most european union member states through national legislation 
as a result of this legislation  we are subject to regulation and oversight in certain eu member nations  including the requirement that we maintain specified regulatory capital 
privacy and information security laws we provide services that may be subject to various state  federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include the federal gramm leach bliley act  which applies to a broad range of financial institutions and to companies that provide services to financial institutions

among other things  these foreign and domestic laws  and their implementing regulations  restrict the collection  processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal information  require notice to individuals of privacy practices  and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information 
these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and removal or elimination of personal information

failure to safeguard our data could affect our reputation among our merchant clients and cardholders  and may expose us to penalties  fines  liabilities and legal claims 
under visa  mastercard  american express and discover card network rules  and various state laws  we are responsible for information provided to us by merchants  iso  third party service providers  and other agents all of which we refer to as associated third parties  which we require in order to process transactions and for fraud prevention 
this information includes bankcard numbers  names  addresses  social security numbers  driver license numbers  and bank account numbers 
we process the data and deliver our products and services by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated both by us and by third party service providers 
we have ultimate liability to the card networks and their member financial institutions for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties to protect this information 
although plans and procedures are in place to protect this sensitive data  we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats designed to breach our systems in order to gain access to confidential information 
our computer systems have been  and could be in the future  subject to penetration and our data protection procedures may not prevent unauthorized use 
we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information  such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws 
although we generally require that our agreements with service providers who have access to merchant and customer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any customer or merchant data except in accordance with the applicable agreements  we cannot assure you that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data 
in addition  we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of merchant and consumer data 
the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability and protracted and costly litigation 
in early march of  we identified and self reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our north america card processing system 
our investigation also revealed potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from merchants who applied for processing services 
the merchants who could potentially be affected are limited to those based in the us we cannot verify those potentially affected as it is unclear whether any information was exported  however  we notified potentially affected individuals and made available credit monitoring and identity protection insurance at no cost to the individuals 
as a result of this event  certain card networks removed us from their list of payment card industry data security standards pci dss compliant service providers 
our work to remediate our systems and processes is complete 
we hired a qsa to conduct an independent review of the pci dss compliance of our systems 
global payments direct  inc  our primary operating entity  has been returned to the list of pci dss compliant service providers and we have received reports on compliance covering all of our systems that process  store  transmit or otherwise utilize card data 
to date  we have not experienced a material loss of revenue that we can confirm has been related to this event 
however  this event and our related remediation efforts could potentially have a negative impact on future revenues 
during the fiscal year ended may   we recorded million of expense associated with this incident  bringing the life to date total expense to million 
of this amount  million represents the costs we have incurred through may  for legal fees  fees of consultants and other professional advisors engaged to conduct the investigation and various other costs associated with the investigation and remediation 
an additional million represents total fraud losses  fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks 
we also recorded million of insurance recoveries 
during fiscal  we reduced our accrual for fraud losses  fines and other charges by million 
we based our initial estimate of fraud losses  fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks 
we have now reached resolution with and made payments to the networks  resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates 
the primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected 

table of contents a security breach like the one that recently occurred  or other misuse of data could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our products and services  increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the breach  expose us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability  disrupt our operations including potential service interruptions  increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny  result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state  federal and foreign laws or by the card networks  and adversely affect our continued card network registration and financial institution sponsorship 
we have insurance that we believe would provide coverage of costs associated with a security incident 
however  there can be no assurance that such costs would not materially exceed such insurance coverage 
our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship and  in some cases  continued participation in certain card networks 
in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services  we must be either a direct participant or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard 
registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks of both organizations 
if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us  we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct participation  either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive 
if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct participation  we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers which would negatively impact our revenues and earnings 
furthermore  some agreements with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices  including our solicitation  application  and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants 
our bank sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in connection with direct participation  the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements 
any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes 
in canada  we have filed an application with the canadian regulatory authorities for the formation of a wholly owned loan company in canada which could serve as our financial institution sponsor 
while such application is pending  in march  we obtained temporary direct participation in the visa canada system 
this temporary status currently expires on october  in the event the wholly owned loan company has not been approved by such expiration date and visa is unwilling to extend such temporary status  we have entered into an agreement with a financial institution that is willing to serve as our sponsor  however that agreement is not intended to be a long term solution 
we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities 
if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement  our business may be adversely affected 
we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities 
if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services  we must find other financial institutions to provide those services 
if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers which could negatively impact our revenue and earnings 
if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks  they could seek to fine us  suspend us or terminate our registrations 
if our merchants or isos incur fines or penalties that we cannot collect from them  we could end up bearing the cost of such fines or penalties 
we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions 
the rules of the card networks are set by their boards  which may be influenced by card issuers  and some of those issuers are our competitors with respect to these processing services 
many banks directly or indirectly sell processing services to merchants in direct competition with us 
these banks could attempt  by virtue of their influence on the networks  to alter the networks rules or policies to the detriment of non members like us 
the termination of our registrations or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor  or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards  including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards  that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if a merchant or an iso fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks  it could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks 
if we cannot collect such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso  we could end up bearing such fines or penalties  resulting in lower earnings for us 
the termination of our registration  or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our 
table of contents registration  could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services  which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale 
increased merchant  referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline 
we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors  including business closures  transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors  unsuccessful contract renewal renegotiation  and account closures that we initiate for various reasons  such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants 
our iso sales channel is a strong contributor to our revenue growth in our north america merchant services segment 
if an iso partner switches to another transaction processor  terminates our services  shuts down or becomes insolvent  we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso  and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso 
we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase 
our referral partners are an important source of new business 
higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the payment processing industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may give them an advantage in our market with respect to the pricing of our products and services offered to our customers  and our ability to develop new technologies 
we operate in the electronic payments market  which is highly competitive 
our primary competitors in these markets include other independent processors  as well as financial institutions  isos  and  potentially  card networks 
many of our competitors are companies that are larger than we are and have greater financial and operational resources than we have 
in addition  our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a bank for registration with the card networks 
these factors may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers  which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well 
higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  many of our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies and services  including internet payment processing services and mobile payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable to customers  again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our offerings 
additionally  our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur costs associated with being sponsored by a direct participant for registration with the card networks and can settle transactions more quickly for their merchants than we can for ours 
this may allow our competitors to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective merchants  or other products or services that we do not offer 
this could result in a loss of customers  greater difficulty attracting new customers  and a reduction in the price we can charge for our services 
furthermore  we are facing competition from non traditional competitors  such as paypal and google  who offer alternative payment methods 
these non traditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers 
if these non traditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions  it could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings  we must continually update our products and services  a process which could result in increased costs and the loss of revenues  earnings and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 
the electronic payments markets in which we compete are subject to rapid technological changes 
these markets are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
in order to remain competitive  we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of a new front end platform for electronic payments processing  mobile payment applications  e commerce services and other new offerings emerging in the electronic payments industry 
these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort  including cost overruns  delays in delivery and performance problems 
in the electronic payments markets these risks are even more acute 
any delay in the delivery of new products or services or the failure to differentiate our products and services could render them less desirable to our customers  or possibly even obsolete 
in addition  the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions  all at very high volumes and processing speeds 
any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses 
as a result of these factors  our 
table of contents development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenue and earnings if promised new products are not timely delivered to our customers or do not perform as anticipated 
we also rely in part on third parties  including some of our competitors and potential competitors  for the development of and access to new technologies 
furthermore  our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies and services  including e commerce and mobile payment processing services  that provide improved operating functionality and features to their existing service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our services less desirable to clients  resulting in the loss of clients or a reduction in the fees we could generate from our offerings 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
for example  beginning in both mastercard and visa are requiring processors in the united states to support europay  mastercard  and visa emv credit and debit card authentication 
developing and implementing support for emv requires us to invest significant resources and there is no certainty as to when  or even if  our merchants or financial institution customers will use or accept emv 
in order for us to continue to grow and increase our profitability  we must continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments markets and also expand into new markets 
our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate  the further expansion of these markets  the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing  and our ability to penetrate these markets 
as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion  we look for acquisition opportunities  investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration  technological capabilities  product offerings and distribution capabilities 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition  investment and alliance candidates in the future  and if we do  they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated 
once completed  investments and alliances may not realize the value that we expect 
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market 
we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets 
if we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments markets  we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 
there may be a decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general 
if consumers do not continue to use credit or debit cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash  credit cards  and debit cards  which is adverse to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe future growth in the use of credit and debit cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost  ease of use  and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses 
in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability  consumers and businesses must continue to use electronic payment methods that we process including credit and debit cards 
our systems and our third party providers systems may fail which could interrupt our service  cause us to lose business  increase our costs and expose us to liability 
we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems  software  data centers and telecommunications networks  as well as the systems and services of third parties 
in addition  we have undertaken the relocation of our primary data center 
we have entered into agreements related to this relocation and for the ongoing management of the data center 
a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss  but we may also be liable to third parties 
our systems and operations or those of our third party providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from  among other things  fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist acts  war  unauthorized entry  human error  and computer viruses or other defects 
defects in our systems or those of third parties  errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions  telecommunications failures  or other difficulties including those related to the system relocation could result in loss of revenue  loss of customers  loss of merchant and cardholder data  harm to our business or reputation  exposure to fraud 
table of contents losses or other liabilities  negative publicity  additional operating and development costs  fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks  and or diversion of technical and other resources 
we may experience software defects  undetected errors  and development delays  which could damage customer relations  decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability 
our products are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors  viruses  or defects 
defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  loss of credibility with current or potential customers  harm to our reputation  or exposure to liability claims 
in addition  we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors  viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we incur chargeback liability when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers 
we cannot accurately anticipate these liabilities  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant  the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder 
if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchant account or reserve account if applicable  or if the merchant refuses or is unable  due to closure  bankruptcy or other reasons  to reimburse us for a chargeback  we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder 
the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment 
we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future 
any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have policies to manage merchant related credit risk and often mitigate such risk by establishing reserve accounts  requesting collateral and establishing caps for monthly processing 
notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk  it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business 
fraud by merchants or others could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others 
examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit or debit card  card number  or other credentials to record a false sales or credit transaction  processes an invalid card  or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction 
criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud 
failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback liability or cause us to incur other liabilities 
it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future 
increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to economic and political risk  the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer  business and government spending  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the global electronic payments industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer  business and government spending 
we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence  consumer spending  consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits 
a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments 
a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits 
if our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services using electronic payments or people spend less money per transaction  we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts  resulting in lower revenue 
a downturn in the economy could force retailers to close  resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines 
furthermore  credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and be more selective with respect to whom they issue credit cards 
we also have a certain amount of fixed and other costs  including rent  debt service  processing contractual minimums and salaries  which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy 
changes in economic conditions could also adversely impact our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  a recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings  resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us 
our merchants are liable for any charges properly reversed by the card issuer on behalf of the cardholder 
our associated third parties are also liable for any fines  or penalties  that may be assessed by any card networks 
in the event that we are not able to collect such amounts from the associated third parties  due to fraud  breach of contract  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such charges 
reject losses arise from the fact that  in most markets  we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period 
this results in the build up of a substantial receivable from our customers 
if a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period  we may be unable to collect such fees  which negatively impacts our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increases in credit card network fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our earnings 
from time to time  the card networks  including visa and mastercard  increase the fees that they charge processors such as us 
we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers  but this strategy might result in the loss of those customers to our competitors who do not pass along the increases 
if competitive practices prevent our passing along such increased fees to our merchant customers in the future  we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby reducing our net revenues  increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings 
any new or changes made to laws  regulations  card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results 
our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect our industry in the countries in which we operate 
regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years 
failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration  the limitation  suspension or termination of service  and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  including fines  or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
for example  we are subject to the card network rules of visa  mastercard  and other card networks  interac  and various debit networks  applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate and of the card networks  the payment services directive in europe  the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada issued by canada department of finance  housing assistance tax act of in the united states  which requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchant acquiring entities  along with a myriad of consumer protection laws and escheat regulations 
we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions 
interchange fees which are typically paid by the acquirer to the issuer in connection with transactions are subject to increasingly intense legal  regulatory  and legislative scrutiny worldwide 
for instance  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which was signed into law in july  significantly changes the us financial regulatory system 
changes affecting the payment processing industry include restricting amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allowing merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods 
on june   the federal reserve board adopted the final rules implementing the debit interchange fee and routing and exclusivity provisions in dodd frank 
the overall impact of dodd frank on us is difficult to estimate because it will take some time for the market to react and adjust to the new regulations 
these decisions and regulatory actions  even if not directed at us  may require significant efforts to change our systems and products and may require changes to how we price our services to customers 
until final decisions around implementation are announced  we cannot predict the impact of any of these changes on our operations and financial condition 
changes to legal rules and regulations  or interpretation or enforcement thereof  could have a negative financial effect on our business 
in addition  even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations  as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness  could damage our business or our reputation 
furthermore  we are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct business 
changes in such laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive  the value of tax losses and tax credit carry forwards recorded on our balance sheet and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the costs and effects of pending and future litigation  investigations or similar matters  or adverse facts and developments related thereto  could materially affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
we are from time to time involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business 
our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted 
table of contents against us  and any claims asserted against us  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may harm our reputation 
furthermore  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with foreign operations and investments outside the united states could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar 
revenue and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 
for example  for fiscal year  currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by million and our earnings by per diluted share 
we historically have not used forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange risk 
we also have indirect foreign investments  which are subject to country risk such as sovereign  economic  political  and location risks 
these investments are short term in nature and with private sector issuers 
country risk could impact the valuation and liquidity of those investments 
in addition  in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currency into united states dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions 
the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 
we conduct a portion of our business in various european and asia pacific countries  including the russian federation  where the risk of continued political  economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the united states 
we expect to continue to expand our operations into various countries in europe and the asia pacific region 
some of these countries  and other foreign countries in which we operate  such as the russian federation and spain  have undergone significant political  economic and social change in recent years  and the risk of new  unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the united states 
in particular  changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations  whether caused by a change in government or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in many countries 
although these regulations have not had a material impact on us to date  changes in these regulations  including taxation or limitations on transfers of data between countries  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
the integration and conversion of our acquired operations  or other future acquisitions  if any  could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating both businesses as one are not achieved  a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process  and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 
the acquisition  integration  and conversion of businesses involves a number of risks 
core risks are in the area of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence and integration and conversion managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company people  products  technology  and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition 
in addition  international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including  for example managing geographically separated organizations  systems  and facilities  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  complying with foreign regulatory requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  difficulty entering new foreign markets due to  among other things  customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets  and general economic and political conditions 
if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly  the following factors  among others  could reduce our revenues and earnings  increase our operating costs  and result in a loss of projected synergies 
table of contents if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans  duties and responsibilities  and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business  we could lose employees to our competitors in the region  which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration  if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services  or the quality of those services  we could lose customers to our competitors  which would reduce our revenues and earnings  and the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new electronic payments markets 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological  social  economic  and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital 
to successfully compete and grow  we must recruit  develop and retain the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs 
in addition  we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital 
however  the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors 
our efforts to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses  which could negatively affect our profitability 
we cannot assure that key personnel  including executive officers  will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets 
the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result of our acquisitions  a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets including goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets  net of amortization  together accounted for approximately and of the total assets on our balance sheet as of may  and may   respectively 
we may not realize the full value of our intangible assets and goodwill 
we expect to engage in additional acquisitions  which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill 
we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired 
under current accounting rules  any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets  resulting in a charge to our earnings 
an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense 
our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal  state  local  and international taxing authorities 
an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense  thereby negatively impacting our results of operations 
we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions  transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority 
while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability 
an unfavorable resolution  therefore  could negatively impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the current and or future periods 
we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes 
deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates 
changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our results of operations 
we may become subject to additional united states  state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchant services customers  in which case our earnings could be adversely affected 
payment processing companies like us may be subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or certain portions of our fees charged to customers for our services 
application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on this topic 
if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax expense through to our merchant customers  our costs will increase  reducing our earnings 

table of contents we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws which have been confirmed through either tax rulings or opinions obtained in various jurisdictions including those related to value added taxes in europe 
changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive  the amount of our cash flow  and have a material adverse impact on our business 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
further  this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we may complete 
in certain markets in the asia pacific region  the republic of malta and spain  our member sponsors perform payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to services agreements 
we expect that the member sponsors will continue to provide these services until such time as we may integrate these functions into our operations 
accordingly  we rely on our member sponsors to provide financial data  such as revenue billed to merchants  to assist us with compiling our accounting records 
as such  our internal controls over financial reporting could be materially affected  or are reasonably likely to be materially affected  by the internal controls and procedures of our member sponsors in these markets 
in order to mitigate this risk  we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting which monitor the accuracy of the financial data being provided by our member sponsors while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market perception of our business and our stock price 
anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws and provisions of georgia law could delay or prevent a change of control that individual shareholders favor 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  and provisions of applicable georgia law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable 
the provisions of our articles and by laws  among other things divide our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected in staggered three year terms  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
we may not be able to or we may decide not to pay dividends at a level anticipated by shareholders of our common stock  which could reduce shareholder returns 
the payment of dividends on our common stock in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on  among other factors  our earnings  shareholders equity  cash position  and financial condition 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 
we operate in a rapidly changing industry 
accordingly  our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify  monitor  and manage our risks 
if our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in capturing all risks to which we are or may be exposed  we may suffer uninsured liability  harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
continued consolidation in the banking and retail industries could adversely affect our growth 

table of contents historically  the banking industry has been the subject of consolidation  regardless of overall economic conditions  while the retail industry has been the subject of consolidation due to cyclical economic events 
since  there have been multiple bank failures and government encouraged consolidation 
larger banks and larger merchants with greater transaction volumes may demand lower fees which could result in lower revenues and earnings for us 
our bank alliances and other strategies could also be negatively impacted as a result of consolidations  especially where the banks involved operate competing merchant processing businesses 
the company debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit the company flexibility in operating its business 
our credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions 
these covenants limit our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends on  repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments  sell certain assets  create liens  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the company assets  and enter into certain transactions with the company affiliates
