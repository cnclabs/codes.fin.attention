our product portfolio includes active cellular immunotherapies and a small molecule product candidate that could be applicable to treating multiple types of cancers 

table of contents provenge sipuleucel t is our only commercialized product approved by the united states food and drug administration fda  and is a first in class autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic  metastatic  castrate resistant hormone refractory prostate cancer 
commercial sale of provenge began in may prostate cancer is the most common non skin cancer among men in the united states  with over one million men currently diagnosed with the disease  and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the united states 
we currently own worldwide rights for provenge 
we generated net revenue from sales of provenge of million in  compared to million during approximately parent accounts  some of which have multiple sites  had infused the product as of the end of commercial sale of provenge is currently supported by our orange county facility and our atlanta facility 
we also manufactured provenge at the new jersey facility into december  at which time we sold the new jersey facility to novartis for million 
we believe that with the sale of the new jersey facility  the capacity at our atlanta and orange county facilities will be sufficient to handle the manufacturing of provenge in the volumes that we anticipate 
prior to the sale of the new jersey facility  as announced on july  we initiated a strategic restructuring plan that included re configuring our manufacturing model with the closure of the new jersey facility  restructuring administrative functions and strengthening our commercial functions  which we anticipate will lower our overall cost structure 
as a result of the restructuring  we expect to reduce costs by approximately million annually  including a reduction in headcount of approximately full time and contractor positions 
we expect the implementation of the restructuring initiatives will be substantially completed by june certain projects are subject to a variety of labor and employment laws  rules  and regulations which could result in a delay in implementing these projects 
we are currently seeking marketing authorization for the sale of provenge in europe 
following a number of pre submission meetings with european union national agencies  we expect that data from our phase db impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study  supported by data from our d and da studies  will be sufficient to seek regulatory approval for provenge in the eu using clinical data described in our united states biologics license application  we filed our marketing authorization application maa with the european medicines agency ema  which was validated on january  we plan to manufacture product through a contract manufacturing organization 
we anticipate a regulatory decision from the eu in mid as of december   our manufacturing operations consisted of approximately employees  a decrease from employees as of december  due to the restructuring and workforce reduction  including the closure of the new jersey facility 
our commercial team included approximately employees in sales  marketing  and market access support as of december   an increase from employees as of december   due in part to the realignment of employees from other departments 
critical accounting policies and estimates we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates that could have reasonably been used would have materially changed our consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue primarily from the sale of provenge 
revenue from the sale of provenge is recorded net of product returns and estimated price discounts  including rebates and chargebacks offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and to members of group purchasing organizations gpos with which we have contracts 
revenue from sales of provenge is recognized upon confirmed product delivery to and issuance of a product release form to the physician 
product returns are limited to those instances in which the physician receives the product but does not infuse the product prior to expiry  either due to timing or the failure of the product to meet specifications and pass site inspection 
due to the limited usable life of provenge of approximately hours from the completion of the manufacturing process to patient infusion  actual return information is known and credited against sales in the month incurred 
provenge sales are direct to the physician  however  we have entered into distribution agreements with several credit worthy third party wholesalers the wholesalers whereby we manufacture and ship the product direct to the physician and transfer the sale of provenge to the wholesalers 
under the distribution agreements  the wholesalers assume all bad debt risk from the physician or institution  therefore no allowance for bad debt is recorded 
in addition  under the terms of the distribution agreements  our return policy allows for the return of product that has expired or has a defect prior to delivery  product that is damaged during delivery and product that cannot be infused because it does not otherwise meet specified requirements 
our product is subject to certain required pricing discounts via rebates and or chargebacks pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and  accordingly  revenue recognition requires estimates of rebates and chargebacks 
we have agreements with cms providing for a rebate on sales to eligible medicaid patients 
for sales of our product to eligible medicaid patients  the physician purchases our product at full price  and then receives reimbursement from the applicable state 
the state  in turn  invoices us for the amount of the medicaid rebate 
estimated rebates payable under medicaid are recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction in gross product revenue  and are classified as other accrued liabilities until paid 
our estimate of rebates payable is based on information we gather related to the physician site as well as health insurance information related to the patient being treated 
since there is often a delay between product sale and the processing and payment of the medicaid rebates  we evaluate our estimates regularly  and adjust our estimates as necessary 
we also have agreements with the public health service phs  providing for a chargeback on sales to phs eligible providers  and federal supply schedule fss customers  including the department of veteran affairs and the department of defense  providing for a chargeback on sales to eligible patients 
chargebacks occur when a contracted physician purchases our product at fixed contract prices that are lower than the price we charge the wholesalers 
each wholesaler  in turn  charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the physician 
these chargebacks are estimated and recorded in the period that the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction in gross product revenue and trade accounts receivable 
our estimate of chargebacks is based on information we gather related to the physician site 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into agreements with certain gpos that contract for the purchase of provenge on behalf of their members and provide contract administration services 
beginning in july of  eligible members of the gpos purchase provenge at contracted prices through a chargeback  and may be entitled to receive a rebate on eligible purchases at the end of each quarter 
estimated rebates and administrative fees payable to gpos are recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction in gross product revenue  and are classified as other accrued liabilities until paid 
our estimate of rebates payable is based on information we gather related to sales of our product to eligible gpo members 
royalty revenue in the third quarter of  we began receiving royalties on merck s sales of victrelis tm boceprevir  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  which was approved in may we received royalties on worldwide 
table of contents net sales of boceprevir pursuant to the terms of a license and collaboration agreement 
royalty revenue and royalty receivables were recorded in the period earned  in advance of collection 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold this royalty to an unrelated third party for million and recognized the full amount as revenue 
no revenue will be recorded related to this royalty in future periods 
inventory inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method 
we began capitalizing raw material inventory in mid april  in anticipation of the potential approval for marketing of provenge in the first half of at this time  our expectation of future benefits became sufficiently high to justify capitalization of these costs  as regulatory approval was considered probable and the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
costs incurred prior to mid april were recorded as research and development expense in our statements of operations 
as of april  we had approximately million in zero cost inventory which was previously expensed and could be used for the commercial and clinical manufacture of provenge  training or additional research and development efforts 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of zero cost inventory remained on hand 
no zero cost inventory remained on hand as of december  cost of product revenue includes antigen expense of approximately million during the year ended cost of product revenue for the years ended and did not include antigen expense as we used zero cost inventory during these periods 
as a result  cost of product revenue reflects a lower average per unit cost of antigen prior to restructuring expenses we record a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
employee termination benefits are accrued when the obligation is probable and estimable 
employee termination benefits are expensed at the date the employee is notified 
if the employee must provide future service in excess of days  such benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period 
for contract termination costs  we record a liability upon the later of the contract termination date or the date we cease using the rights conveyed by the contract 
we have made estimates regarding the amount and timing of our restructuring expense and liability  including current and future period employee termination benefits 
impairment of long lived assets losses from impairment of long lived assets used in operations are recognized when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
refer to note property and equipment and note restructuring  contract termination and asset impairment to our consolidated financial statements for details of losses from impairment of long lived assets recorded in  including impairment of the new jersey facility 
the calculation of estimated fair value of the new jersey facility assets required judgment in the assumptions used in the probability weighted estimated future cash flows related to the highest and best use of the assets  including salvage values 
convertible senior notes due the company s convertible senior notes due the notes  issued in the first quarter of  are convertible at the option of the holder  and we may choose to satisfy conversions  if any  in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  based on a conversion rate initially equal to shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
should a holder of the notes exercise their conversion option during the next twelve month period  it is our intention to satisfy the conversion with shares of common stock 

table of contents the notes are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  debt with conversion and other options  under which issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in part in cash upon conversion  are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the liability component of the notes  as of the issuance date  was calculated by estimating the fair value of a similar liability issued at an effective interest rate  which was determined by considering the rate of return investors would require in the company s debt structure 
the amount of the equity component was calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the notes and resulted in a corresponding increase to debt discount 
the debt discount is being amortized as interest expense through the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the date of conversions  if any 
fair value we measure and report at fair value our cash equivalents and investment securities 
we also measured and reported at fair value our warrant liability  prior to exercise of the warrants in the second quarter of fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability  an exit price  in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
market values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio 
we utilize third party pricing services for all security valuations 
we review the pricing methodology  including the collection of market information  used by the third party pricing services 
on a periodic basis  we also review and validate the pricing information received from the third party providers 
assets and liabilities typically recorded at fair value on a non recurring basis include long lived assets measured at fair value due to an impairment assessment under asc  property  plant and equipment  and asset retirement obligations initially measured under asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized on the accelerated method as expense over the requisite service period 
the fair value of our stock options is calculated using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the bsm model requires judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense for new awards may differ materially from that recorded for existing awards 
restricted stock awards generally vest and are expensed over two to four year periods 
we have granted restricted stock awards and options with certain performance conditions to certain executive officers and key employees 
at each reporting date  we evaluate whether achievement of the performance conditions is probable 
compensation expense is recorded over the appropriate service period based upon our assessment of accomplishing each performance provision or the occurrence of other events which may have caused the awards or options to accelerate and vest 
we determine the fair value of awards under our employee stock purchase plan using the bsm model 
loss contingencies a loss contingency is recorded if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate  among other factors  the probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss 
loss contingencies that we determine to be reasonably possible  but not probable  are disclosed but not recorded 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board issued two accounting standard updates asus which amended guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the previous option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity was eliminated 
although the new guidance changed the presentation of comprehensive income  no changes were made to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under existing guidance 
these asus were effective for us in the first quarter of and retrospective application was required 
accordingly  we changed our financial statement presentation of comprehensive income in our quarterly reports on form q and in this annual report on form k  which had no impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue year ended december  in thousands product revenue  net royalty revenue collaborative revenue total revenue the increase in product revenue in and is due to our commercialization efforts following the approval of provenge for commercial sale on april  approximately parent accounts  some of which have multiple sites  had infused the product as of the end of product revenue for reflects approximately eight months of sales activity 
we expect product revenue to increase in future periods as we expand commercialization and as market acceptance of provenge grows 
revenue from the sale of provenge is recorded net of product returns and estimated pricing discounts via rebates and or chargebacks offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and to members of gpos 
revenue recognition requires estimates of rebates and chargebacks each period 
we recorded estimated rebates  chargebacks and gpo administrative fees of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no such amounts were recorded for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we revised our estimate of outstanding chargebacks related to phs eligible providers  resulting in a reduction in the chargebacks reserve and an increase in net product revenue of million 
the following is a roll forward of our chargebacks reserve year ended december  in thousands beginning balance  january current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods adjustments payments credits balance at december 
table of contents the following table is a roll forward of our accrued gpo rebates and gpo administrative fees balance year ended december  in thousands beginning balance  january current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods payments credits balance at december in the third quarter of  we began receiving royalties on merck s sales of victrelis tm boceprevir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  which was approved in may we received royalties on worldwide net sales of boceprevir pursuant to the terms of a license and collaboration agreement 
we recorded royalty revenue of million during the year ended december   related to royalties received on sales of this product 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold this royalty for million to an unrelated third party and recognized the full amount as revenue  as we have no further obligations under the agreement 
no revenue will be recorded related to this royalty in future periods 
royalty revenue also resulted from the recognition of royalties pursuant to another license agreement in each of the years presented 
collaborative revenue resulted from the recognition of deferred revenue related to a license agreement 
cost of product revenue year ended december  in thousands cost of product revenue gross profit gross profit is calculated by subtracting cost of product revenue from net product revenue 
the increase in cost of product revenue in and was due to increased sales of provenge and additional fda approved manufacturing capacity 
cost of product revenue includes the costs of manufacturing and distributing provenge 
prior to fda approval of these facilities  these costs were classified as selling  general and administrative expense 
upon fda approval of the remaining capacity of the new jersey facility in march  the orange county facility in june and the atlanta facility in august  all commercial manufacturing costs at these facilities are included in cost of product revenue 
costs related to the manufacture of provenge for clinical patients are classified as research and development expense 
we began capitalizing raw material inventory in mid april  in anticipation of the potential approval for marketing of provenge in the first half of at this time  our expectation of future benefits became sufficiently high to justify capitalization of these costs  as regulatory approval was considered probable and the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
costs incurred prior to mid april were recorded as research and development expense in our statements of operations 
as of april  we had approximately million in zero cost inventory  which had been previously expensed and could be used for the commercial and clinical manufacture of provenge  training or additional research and development efforts 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of zero cost inventory remained on hand 
no zero cost inventory remained on hand as of december  cost of product revenue includes antigen expense of approximately million during the year ended cost of product revenue for the years ended and did not include antigen expense as we used zero cost inventory during these periods 
as a result  cost of product revenue reflects a lower average per unit cost of antigen prior to 
table of contents offsetting the increase in cost of product revenue in was a decrease in cost of product revenue in the second half of due to certain adjustments recorded as a result of the strategic restructuring plan announced on july  these adjustments include the reversal of accrued bonus for terminated employees and the reversal of stock based compensation expense related to unvested awards of terminated employees 
in addition  cost of product revenue in the second half of includes reduced depreciation expense related to the new jersey facility due to the impairment of property and equipment at this facility in the third quarter of as a result of its planned closure in the fourth quarter 
due to the closure and subsequent sale of the new jersey facility to novartis in december  no expenses related to the new jersey facility will be included in cost of product revenue in future periods 
gross margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as utilization of capacity increases and manufacturing efforts on product cost reduction are successful 
as product sales increase  we anticipate that cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue will decline 
we also anticipate cost of product revenue as a percentage of revenue will decrease in future periods as a result of the strategic restructuring plan announced on july   as further discussed in the overview section 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in expenses related to our research and development activities are categorized as costs associated with clinical programs  research and supplier development expenses 
our research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in millions clinical programs direct costs indirect costs total clinical programs supplier development expenses research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs and employee related expenses of departments directly supporting clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical programs include employee related expenses and other expenses incurred by departments indirectly supporting clinical programs 
costs attributable to supplier development expenses include technology transfer and process development costs related to developing second source suppliers 
costs attributable to research programs represent efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline and other research efforts 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
current product candidates and potential targets for the focus of new product candidates in research and development include dn  our investigational active cellular immunotherapy which potentially may be used for the treatment of patients with bladder  breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her neu 
in december  we filed an investigational new drug ind application with the fda for dn for the treatment of her urothelial carcinoma  including bladder cancer  following surgical resection 
the trial will randomize patients to dn or standard of care  with a primary endpoint of overall survival 
we enrolled our first patient in this trial in september targeted enrollment is approximately patients at clinical sites throughout the united states 

table of contents active cellular immunotherapies directed at ca  an antigen highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma  and cea  an antigen expressed in colorectal and other cancers  are in preclinical development 
trpm transient receptor potential  sub family m  a target for manipulation by small molecule drug therapy 
we are investigating further development of an orally available  small molecule targeting trpm that could be applicable to treating multiple types of cancer 
we completed our phase clinical trial in april for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred related to these product candidates and potential targets were as follows year ended december  in millions dn ca trpm other early pipeline development research and development costs associated with cea for each period presented were not material 
the significant majority of our historical research and development expense has been in connection with provenge in the united states 
in we commenced work in connection with our intention to seek approval of provenge for marketing in the european union 
research and development costs associated with provenge in the united states and in the european union for each period presented were as follows year ended december  in millions provenge united states provenge european union the nature and efforts required to complete a prospective research and development project are typically indeterminable at very early stages when research is primarily conceptual and may have multiple applications 
once a focus towards developing a specific product candidate has been developed  we obtain more visibility into the efforts that may be required to reach conclusion of the development phase 
however  there are inherent risks and uncertainties in developing novel biologics in a rapidly changing industry environment 
to obtain approval of a product candidate from the fda  we must  among other requirements  submit data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate 
in most cases  this entails extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials 
the collection of this data  as well as the preparation of applications for review by the fda and other regulatory agencies outside the united states  is costly in time and effort  and may require significant capital investment 
we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain fda approvals or approvals to market products in foreign markets 
for example  the fda or the equivalent in jurisdictions outside the united states may determine our data is not sufficiently compelling to warrant marketing approval and may require that we engage in additional clinical trials or provide further analysis which may be costly and time consuming 
regardless of the nature of our efforts to complete development of our products and receive marketing approval  we may encounter delays that render our product candidates uncompetitive or otherwise preclude us from marketing products 
we may be required to obtain additional funding to complete development of product candidates or in order to commercialize approved products 
however  such funding may not be available to us on terms we deem 
table of contents acceptable or at all 
our ability to access additional capital is dependent on the success of our business and the perception by the market of our future business prospects 
in the event we were unable to obtain necessary funding  we might halt or temporarily delay ongoing development projects 
we anticipate our research and development expenses in will remain consistent with selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of salaries and wages  stock based compensation  consulting fees  sales and marketing fees and administrative costs to support our operations 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses in and included the expenses associated with the portion of the new jersey facility which was not commercially operational during the first quarter of  the orange county facility for the first half of and the atlanta facility into the third quarter of  including related costs of personnel in training 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased as compared to primarily due to manufacturing facility related costs 
these costs were included in selling  general and administrative expenses prior to fda approval of the facilities for commercial manufacture in  and are included in cost of product revenue upon fda approval 
pre operational costs incurred at the facilities and for start up activities were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in due to certain adjustments recorded as a result of the strategic restructuring plan announced on july  these adjustments include the reversal of accrued bonuses for terminated employees and the reversal of stock based compensation expense related to unvested awards of terminated employees 
offsetting these decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses were increased payroll and non cash stock based compensation costs due to certain executive separations in  and increased sales and marketing costs for provenge 
the significant increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to  was primarily attributable to higher payroll costs from increased headcount and commercial product launch activities  as well as increased manufacturing facility related costs related to start up activities prior to fda approval of the facilities 
we anticipate our selling  general and administrative expenses will decrease in future periods  which will all be realized in general and administrative functions  as a result of the strategic restructuring plan announced on july   as further discussed in the overview section 
restructuring  contract termination and asset impairment charges restructuring on july   we announced that our board of directors approved a strategic restructuring plan that includes re configuring our manufacturing model with the closure of the new jersey facility  restructuring administrative functions and strengthening our commercial functions  which we anticipate will lower our overall cost structure 
the restructuring initiatives include a reduction in workforce of approximately full time and contractor positions 
the employees affected by the workforce reduction were notified the week of september  on december   we announced the sale of our new jersey facility to novartis for million 
as part of the agreement with novartis  approximately employees at the facility that were previously included in the workforce reduction were offered jobs with novartis 
as a result of this workforce reduction  we recorded a charge of approximately million during the year ended december  related to severance  other termination benefits  outplacement services and non cash stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock awards of certain employees with employment agreements 
this includes an adjustment to reduce restructuring expense related to employee termination benefits by million in the fourth quarter of  related to employees accepting 
table of contents offers with novartis 
we expect to incur and record an additional million in restructuring charges related to employee severance benefits through the second quarter of  as employees who were notified the week of september  continue to transition out of the company 
we expect the implementation of the restructuring initiatives will be substantially completed by june in addition  we recorded restructuring charges of million for the year ended december   related to fees associated with planning and developing the restructuring plan  relocation benefits offered to employees  expenses associated with the closure of the new jersey facility and other related expenses 
asset impairment as a result of our decision to close the new jersey facility  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the third quarter of to reduce the net book value of the property and equipment at the new jersey facility to estimated fair value 
the calculation of estimated fair value of the new jersey facility assets required judgment in the assumptions used in the probability weighted estimated future cash flows related to the highest and best use of the assets  including salvage values 
upon sale of the new jersey facility to novartis in december  we recorded a recovery of approximately million 
the recovery was calculated as the proceeds from the sale of the facility of million  plus the release of the facility specific lease and asset retirement obligations  less the remaining net book value of the new jersey facility 
also as a result of the strategic restructuring plan  we discontinued development of a non essential computer software project and recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of the total non cash impairment charge of million and total restructuring expenses of million are included in restructuring  contract termination and asset impairment on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  restructuring on august   as a result of a decrease in anticipated revenue growth in  we announced plans to reduce expenses  including workforce related expenses  to align with our near term manufacturing requirements 
on september   our board of directors approved a reduction in force of approximately of our total workforce  or approximately employees 
the employees affected by the reduction in force were notified the week of september  as a result of this workforce reduction  we recorded a charge of million related to severance  other termination benefits  outplacement services and non cash stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock awards of certain employees with employment agreements 
the amount is included in restructuring  contract termination and asset impairment on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  contract termination on september  we provided written notice to gsk of termination of the gsk agreement effective on october  we entered into the gsk agreement for the commercial production and supply of the antigen used in the manufacture of provenge 
we exercised our right to terminate the gsk agreement when  after unforeseen delays  gsk failed to complete the process implementation phase on or before september  pursuant to the terms of the gsk agreement 
assets included in our prepaid expense and other current assets balance related to the gsk agreement were deemed unusable and  as such  we incurred an expense of million  included in restructuring  contract termination and asset impairment in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  refer to item legal proceedings included in this annual report on form k for disclosure of a lawsuit filed against the company by gsk in november  purporting claims for monies due and owing and breach of the company s obligations under the gsk agreement 
on january   gsk filed a motion to amend its complaint to add a claim for breach of north carolina s unfair and deceptive trade practices act  which 
table of contents dendreon will oppose 
although the ultimate financial impact of the lawsuit is not yet determinable  the company expects to pay approximately million in fees in connection with the termination of the gsk agreement  which is included in the restructuring and contract termination liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in we receive interest income primarily from holdings of cash and investments 
the increase in interest income in and was primarily due to increased holdings of cash and investments as a result of the net proceeds of million realized from the offering of the notes in january and february interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in and as compared to was due to the issuance of our notes in the first quarter of  which resulted in non cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  interest expense recognized on the stated coupon rate of the notes was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
refer to liquidity and capital resources financings from the sale of securities and issuance of convertible notes for further discussion of the accounting for the notes 
we also recorded interest expense  including the amortization of debt issuance costs  related to the convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes of million in both and and million in in addition  interest expense increased in as compared to due to increased financing fees paid to the wholesalers as a result of increased sales of provenge 
we capitalized interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
warrant liability non operating loss associated with the increase in our warrant liability for the year ended december  was million 
the fair value was calculated using the bsm model and was revalued at each reporting period and at the date of exercise in may income taxes we recognized no income tax expense or benefit in or  and million in income tax benefit in relating to refundable credits 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately billion and million  respectively  including million of nols related to excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises which are recorded directly to stockholder s equity only when realized 
we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards r d credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the nols and r d credits expire at various dates  beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the nols and r d credits may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of nols and r d credits before utilization 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
significant components of our deferred tax assets include nols  r d credits and stock based compensation 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance 
the valuation 
table of contents allowance relates primarily to net deferred tax assets from operating losses 
our net deferred tax assets offset by a valuation allowance were million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
as a result  the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards  but not reflected in deferred tax assets  for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
deferred tax assets do not include r d credits generated for the fiscal year the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law on january   which retroactively extended the r d credit back to january  asc requires that the effect of tax legislation is taken into account in the interim period in which the law was enacted 
therefore  the r d credits are not contained in the deferred tax assets but will be included in fiscal year r d credits were approximately million

net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in these periods were a result of costs associated with the commercial launch of provenge  research and development expenses  including clinical trial costs  research costs and supplier development costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in primarily resulted from decreased operating expenditures associated with pre fda approval activities 
in addition  the number of personnel decreased from  as of december  to  as of december  as a result of the strategic restructuring plan announced on july  net cash used in operating activities decreased in  as compared to  due to cash received from the commercial sale of provenge and the sale of the boceprevir royalty in the fourth quarter of  offset by increased expenses associated with the commercial launch of provenge 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment of million in were substantially higher than million in and million in  due to expenditures for the three manufacturing facility build outs 
purchases of property and equipment in and were primarily related to software and facilities related expenditures 
in addition  cash proceeds from the sale of the new jersey facility to novartis received in december of million are included in investing activities for net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared with net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively

as of december   our accumulated deficit was billion 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing and facility expenses  costs associated with the commercial launch of provenge and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and research efforts 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments as of december   together with revenue generated from commercial sales of provenge and giving effect to the reduced levels of spending following the restructurings in and  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months as we continue to invest in commercial operations  continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  potentially invest in commercial infrastructure outside the united states and invest in research and product development 
the majority of our resources continue to be used in support of the commercialization of provenge in the united states 
even if we are able to successfully realize our commercialization goals for provenge  because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with commercialization of a biologic  we are unable to predict when we will become profitable  if at all 
even if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability 
we expect that continued revenue from provenge product sales will be a significant source of cash 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to meet potential long term liquidity needs including continued investment in marketing  manufacturing  information technology and other infrastructure and activities related to the commercialization of provenge in the united states  continuing and expanding internal research and development programs  engaging in clinical trials outside the united states  potential commercial infrastructure development and other investment in order to support the commercialization of provenge in territories outside the united states  and working capital needs

on january   the underwriter exercised the overallotment option in full  and we closed on the sale of the additional million in principal amount of notes on february  net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option  after deducting underwriting fees and other offering expenses  were approximately million 
on january   we entered into the first supplemental indenture the supplemental indenture with the bank of new york mellon trust company  na  as trustee the trustee  to our existing base indenture the base indenture and  together with the supplemental indenture  the indenture  dated as of march  the indenture sets forth the rights and provisions governing the notes 
interest at per annum is payable on the notes semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  beginning on july  record dates for payment of interest on the notes are each january and july the maturity date of the notes is january   unless earlier converted 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder  and we may choose to satisfy conversions  if any  in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  based on a conversion rate initially equal to shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the conversion rate will be increased under certain circumstances described in the indenture  however  the number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of a note will not exceed per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in accordance with the indenture 
should a holder exercise the conversion option during the next twelve month period  it is our intention to satisfy the conversion with shares of common stock 
consequently  the notes are classified as a long term liability as of december  and the conversion rate will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events  including stock dividends or share splits  the issuance of rights  options or warrants  spin offs or other distribution of property  cash dividends or distributions  or tender offers or exchange offers 
we will not make an adjustment to the conversion rate for any transaction described above other than share splits or share combinations if each holder of the notes 
table of contents has the right to participate in such transaction at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of common stock  and solely as a result of holding the notes  without having to convert the notes and as if a number of shares of common stock were held equal to the applicable conversion rate multiplied by the principal amount of notes held 
if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs  holders of notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due thereon 
however  if a fundamental change occurs and a holder elects to convert notes  we will under certain circumstances  increase the applicable conversion rate for the notes surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of common stock  based on the date on which the fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the fundamental change as specified in the indenture 
at our option  we will satisfy our conversion obligation with cash  shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares  unless the consideration for common stock in any fundamental change is comprised entirely of cash  in which case the conversion obligation will be paid in cash 
the number of additional shares of common stock was determined such that the fair value of the additional shares would be expected to approximate the fair value of the convertible option at the date of the fundamental change 
in addition  we may from time to time increase the conversion rate  to the extent permitted by law  by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least business days and we provide business days prior written notice of such increase 
we may increase the conversion rate if the board of directors determines that such increase would avoid or diminish united states federal income tax to holders of common stock in connection with a dividend or distribution 
the indenture contains customary covenants 
the notes are accounted for in accordance with asc  under which issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in part in cash upon conversion are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the liability component of the notes  as of the issuance date  was calculated by estimating the fair value of a similar liability issued at an effective interest rate  which was determined by considering the rate of return investors would require in the company s debt structure 
the amount of the equity component was calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the notes and resulted in a corresponding increase to debt discount 
the debt discount is being amortized as interest expense through the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the date of conversions  if any 
the application of asc resulted in the initial recognition of million as the debt discount recorded in additional paid in capital for the notes 
at december   the net carrying amount of the liability component  which is recorded as a long term liability in the consolidated balance sheet  was million  and the remaining unamortized debt discount was million 
amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs for the years ended december  and resulted in non cash interest expense of million and million  respectively

record dates for payment of interest on the notes are each june and december the maturity date of the notes is june   unless earlier converted 
in certain circumstances  additional amounts may become due on the notes as additional interest 
we can elect that the sole remedy for an event of default for our failure to comply with the reporting obligations provisions of the indenture under which the notes were issued the indenture  for the first days 
table of contents after the occurrence of such event of default would be for the holders of the notes to receive additional interest on the notes at an annual rate equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the notes 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder  initially at a conversion price of per share  equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment 
there may be an increase in the conversion rate of the notes under certain circumstances described in the indenture  however  the number of shares of common stock issued will not exceed per  principal amount of notes 
if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due thereon 
however  a holder that converts notes in connection with a fundamental change may  in some circumstances  be entitled to an increased conversion rate ie  a lower per share conversion price as a make whole premium 
the increased conversion rates were determined such that the fair value of the additional shares would be expected to approximate the fair value of the convertible option at the date of the fundamental change 
in addition  the conversion rate will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events  including stock dividends or share splits  the issuance of rights or warrants  other distribution of property  cash dividends or distributions  or tender offers or exchange offers 
we will not make an adjustment to the conversion rate for any transaction described above other than share splits or share combinations if each holder of notes has the right to participate in such transaction at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of common stock  and solely as a result of holding notes  without having to convert notes and as if a number of shares of common stock were held equal to the applicable conversion rate multiplied by the principal amount of notes held
