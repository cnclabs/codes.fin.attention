the passage of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our atms would severely impact our revenues 
despite the nationwide acceptance of surcharge fees at atms in the united states since their introduction in  consumer activists have from time to time attempted to impose local bans or limits on surcharge fees 
even in the few instances where these efforts have passed the local governing body such as with an ordinance adopted by the city of santa monica  california  federal courts have overturned these local laws on federal preemption grounds 
although section of the dodd frank act passed in july contains a provision that will limit the application of federal preemption with respect to state laws that do not discriminate against national banks  federal preemption will not be affected by local municipal laws  where such proposed bans or limits often arise 
more recently  some federal officials have expressed concern that surcharge fees charged by banks and non bank atm operators are unfair to consumers 
to that end  an amendment proposing limits on the fees that atm operators  including financial institutions  can charge consumers was introduced in the united states senate  but was not ultimately included in the final version of the dodd frank act that was signed into law 
if similar proposed legislation were to be enacted in the future  and the amount we were able to charge for consumers to use our atms was reduced  our revenues and related profitability would be negatively impacted 
furthermore  if such limits were set at levels that are below our current or future costs to operate our atms  it would have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate under our current business model 
in the united kingdom  the treasury select committee of the house of commons published a report regarding surcharges in the atm industry in march following this report  this committee was formed to investigate public concerns regarding the atm industry  including adequacy of disclosure to atm customers regarding surcharges  whether atm providers should be required to provide free services in low income areas  and whether to limit the level of surcharges 
while the committee made numerous recommendations to parliament regarding the atm industry  including that atms should be subject to the banking code a voluntary code of practice adopted by all financial institutions in the united kingdom  the united kingdom government did not accept the committee s recommendations 
despite the rejection of the committee s recommendations  the united kingdom government sponsored an atm task force to look at social exclusion in relation to atm services 
as a result of the task force s findings  approximately additional free to use atms to be provided by multiple atm providers were required to be installed in low income areas throughout the united kingdom 
while this was less than a increase in free to use atms throughout the united kingdom  there is no certainty that other similar proposals will not be made and accepted in the future 
if the legislature or another body with regulatory authority in the united kingdom were to impose limits on the level of surcharges for atm transactions  our revenue from operations in the united kingdom would be negatively impacted 
in mexico  surcharging for off premise atms was legalized in late  but was not formally implemented until july in early october  the central bank of mexico adopted new rules regarding how atm operators disclose fees to consumers 
the objective of these rules was to provide more transparency to the consumer regarding the cost of a specific atm transaction  rather than to limit the amount of fees charged to the consumer 
such rules  which became effective in may  required atm operators to elect between receiving interchange fees from card issuing banks or surcharge fees from consumers 
cardtronics mexico elected to assess a surcharge fee on the consumer rather than select the interchange fee only option  and subsequently raised the level of its surcharge fees in order to recoup the interchange fees it is no longer receiving 
since the new fee structure became effective  the number of surcharge withdrawal transactions conducted on cardtronics mexico s atms has substantially declined on a same store basis  and  to date  there has been no indication that suggests transaction levels will recover to levels experienced prior to the new rules being in effect 
at the current transaction levels  the additional surcharge fee amounts at a number of cardtronics mexico s atms are not sufficient to offset the lost interchange revenues  which has resulted in lower revenues and profitability per atm in that market 
potential new currency designs may require modifications to our atms that could severely impact our cash flows 
in that action styled american council of the blind  et 
al  v 
timothy f 
geithner  secretary of the treasury case cv in the us district court for the district of columbia the court an order was entered that found that us s currencies as currently designed violated the rehabilitation act  a law that prohibits discrimination in government programs on the basis of disability  as the paper currencies issued by the us are identical in size and color  regardless of denomination 
as a consequence of this ruling  the us treasury stated in its semi annual status report filed with the court in september  that the bep was making progress towards implementing the secretary s decision to provide meaningful access to paper currency by adding a raised tactile feature to each federally reserve note that the bep may lawfully redesign  continuing the bep s program of adding large high contrast numerals and different colors to each denomination that it may lawfully redesign  and implementing a supplemental currency reader distribution program for blind and other visually impaired us citizens and legal residents 
of these steps only the first affects in any reasonable manner the atm industry 
further  while it is still uncertain at this time what impact  if any  adding a raised tactile feature to notes that may be dispensed from an atm will have on the atm industry including us  it is possible that such a change could require us to incur additional costs  which could be substantial  to modify our atms in order to store and dispense notes with raised tactile features 
the majority of the electronic debit networks over which our transactions are conducted require sponsorship by a bank 
in each of the geographic segments in which we operate  bank sponsorship is required in order to process transactions over certain networks 
in the united states  our largest geographic segment by revenues  bank sponsorship is required on the significant majority of our transactions and we primarily rely on one sponsor bank for access to the applicable networks  and  in lesser part  on two other sponsor banks 
in our united kingdom segment  only international transactions require bank sponsorship 
in mexico  all atm transactions require bank sponsorship  which is currently provided by our banking partners in the country 
in canada  bank sponsorship is also required and is obtained through our relationships with third party processors 
if our current sponsor banks decide to no longer provide this service  or are no longer financially capable of providing this service as may be determined by certain networks  it may be difficult to find an adequate replacement at a cost similar to what we incur today  or potentially  we could incur a temporary service disruption for certain transactions in the event we lose or do not retain bank sponsorship 
developments in electronic financial transactions could materially reduce our transaction levels and revenues 
certain developments in the field of electronic financial transactions may reduce the need for services offered at our devices in the future 
these developments could encompass technological changes and advancement in the areas of payments as well as physical self service financial devices  governmental actions  customer preferences  as well as other factors 
if transaction levels over our existing atm locations were to decrease as a result of one or several of these developments  our business could be adversely affected 
our inability to adopt technology to meet changing industry or customer needs and trends may affect our competitiveness or demand for our products  which may adversely affect our operating results 
changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services 
we operate in industries that are subject to technological advancements  developing industry standards and changing customer needs and preferences 
in addition  our customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses 
we must anticipate and respond to these industry and customer changes in order to remain competitive within our markets 
our inability to respond to new industry standards  trends and technological advancements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the passage of anti money laundering legislation could cause us to lose certain merchant accounts and reduce our revenues 
recent concerns by the us federal government regarding the use of atms to launder money could lead to the imposition of additional regulations on our sponsoring financial institutions and our merchant customers regarding the source of cash loaded into their atms 
in particular  such regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs by individual merchants who load their own cash  thereby making their atms less profitable 
accordingly  some individual merchants may decide to discontinue their atm operations  thus reducing the number of merchant owned accounts that we currently manage 
if such a reduction were to occur  we would see a corresponding decrease in our revenues 
our operating results have fluctuated historically and could continue to fluctuate in the future  which could affect our ability to maintain our current market position or expand 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the atm and financial services industries  changes in payment trends and offerings in the markets in which we operate  competition from other companies providing the same or similar services that we offer  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses  capital expenditures  and expenses related to the expansion of sales  marketing  and operations  including as a result of acquisitions  if any  the timing and magnitude of any impairment charges that may materialize over time relating to our goodwill  intangible assets or long lived assets  changes in the general level of interest rates in the markets in which we operate  changes in regulatory requirements associated with the atm and financial services industries  changes in the mix of our current services  changes in the financial condition and credit risk of our customers  and changes in the financial condition and operational execution of our key vendors and service providers 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years  this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short term  particularly with respect to personnel expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  and interest expense 
therefore  our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
as such  comparisons to prior periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the rapidly changing automated consumer financial services industry  and the geographical segments in which we operate 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of several of our senior executives would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage  and retain other qualified management  as well as technical and operational personnel as we grow 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel in the future  which could adversely impact our business
