overview and outlook occupancy in the company s properties as well as its ability to increase rental rates directly affects revenues 
the company s revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting its sites on a long term basis 
the company has approximately  annual sites  approximately  seasonal sites  which are leased to customers generally for three to six months  and approximately  transient sites  occupied by customers who lease sites on a short term basis 
the revenue from seasonal and transient sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters 
the company expects to service over  customers at its transient sites and the company considers this revenue stream to be its most volatile as it is subject to weather conditions  gas prices  and other factors affecting the marginal rv customer s vacation and travel preferences 
finally  the company has approximately  sites designated as right to use sites  which are primarily utilized to service the approximately  customers who have right to use contracts 
the company also has interests in properties containing approximately  sites for which revenue is classified as equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
total sites as of december  community sites resort sites annual seasonal transient right to use joint ventures includes approximately  sites rented on an annual basis 
joint ventures have approximately  annual sites  approximately seasonal sites and approximately transient sites 
a significant portion of the company s rental agreements on community sites are directly or indirectly tied to published cpi statistics that are issued during june through september each year 
the company currently expects its core community base rental income to increase approximately as compared to the company has already notified of its community site customers of rent increases reflecting this revenue growth 
nineteen of our california properties and one of our five massachusetts properties are affected by local rent control regulations 
the impact of the rent control ordinances is to limit our ability to implement rent increases based on prevailing market conditions 
the ordinances generally provide the ability to increase rates by a fraction of the increase in the cpi 
the limit on rent increases may range from to of cpi with certain maximum limits depending on the jurisdiction 
the company believes the disruption in the site built housing market has impacted its home sales business 
customers inability to sell their existing site built homes and relocate to their retirement destination has significantly reduced new home sales volumes since in addition  while the majority of customers historically paid cash to purchase new homes in our communities  the company believes the lack of affordable chattel financing is impacting customer purchase decisions in the current economic environment 
current programs available for chattel loan financing provide subsidized financing to customers with the community owner carrying the obligation for guaranteeing customer defaults 
financing continues to have stringent underwriting criteria  sizable down payments  short loan amortization and high interest rates 
in this environment  the company believes that customer demand for rentals  which do not require a down payment  is high 
the company is adapting to this by renting its vacant new homes 
this may represent an attractive source of occupancy if the company can transition from renters to new homebuyers in the future 
the company is also focusing on smaller  more energy efficient and more affordable homes in its manufactured home properties 
the company s manufactured home rental operations have been increasing since for the year ended december   occupied manufactured home rentals increased to  or  from for the year ended december  net operating income  net of depreciation expense of approximately million  increased to approximately million  of which approximately million of rental operations revenue was included in community base rental income  for the year ended december  from approximately million  of which approximately million of rental operations revenue was included in community base rental income  for the year ended december  beginning in  depreciation on the rental units started after being reclassified to buildings and other depreciable property

the company continues to evaluate home rental operations and may continue to invest in additional units 
in the company s resort properties  the company continues to work on extending customer stays 
the company has had success lengthening customer stays

such products may include right to use contracts that entitle the customer to use certain properties the agreements 
the company is offering a zone park pass zpp  which can be purchased for one to four zones of the united states and required annual payments in of beginning on february   the required annual payments increased to this replaces high cost products that were typically entered into at properties after tours and lengthy sales presentations 
the company historically incurred significant costs to generate leads  conduct tours and make the sales presentations 
a single zone zpp requires no upfront payment while passes for additional zones require modest upfront payments 
since inception the company has entered into approximately  zpp s 
for the year ended december   the company entered into approximately  zpp s  or a increase from approximately  for the year ended december  in  the company initiated a program with rv dealers to feature the company s zpp as part of the dealers sales and marketing efforts 
in return  the company provides the dealer with a zpp membership to give to the dealers customers in connection with the purchase of an rv 
since the inception of the zpp program with the rv dealers  the company has activated  zpps and recorded approximately  of revenue through december  existing membership customers may be offered an upgrade agreement from time to time 
an upgrade agreement is currently distinguishable from a new agreement that a customer would enter into by  depending on the type of upgrade  offering increased length of consecutive stay by ie up to days  ability to make earlier advance reservations  discounts on rental units  access to additional properties  which may include use of sites at non membership rv properties and membership in discount travel programs 
each upgrade contract requires a nonrefundable upfront payment 
the company may finance the nonrefundable upfront payment under any agreement

at any time these negotiations are at varying stages  which may include contracts outstanding  to acquire certain properties  which are subject to satisfactory completion of the company s due diligence review

with respect to any refinancing of maturing debt  the company s future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes in interest rates or other debt terms  including required amortization payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life 
in accordance with the codification sub topic impairment or disposal of long lived assets fasb asc  the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets to be held and used  including its investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
the company s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments 
these factors include the general economic climate  competition from other housing options  local conditions  such as an increase in unemployment  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance  and changes in market rental rates 
any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our assets  including real estate and investments in unconsolidated joint venture partnerships 
for long lived assets to be held and used  if an impairment indicator exists  the company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of that asset 
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  the company would record an impairment loss for the carrying amount in excess of the estimated fair value  if any  of the asset 
for the periods presented  no impairment losses were recorded 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time the company has made the decision to dispose of the property  has a commitment to sell the property and or is actively marketing the property for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
the company accounts for its properties held for disposition in accordance with fasb asc accordingly  the results of operations for all assets sold or held for sale are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented  as applicable 
revenue recognition the company accounts for leases with its customers as operating leases 
rental income is recognized over the term of the respective lease or the length of a customer s stay  the majority of which are for a term of not greater than one year 
the company evaluates all amounts receivable from customers and an allowance is established for amounts greater than days past due 
the company s allowance for uncollectible rents receivable was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company will continue to monitor and assess these receivables and changes in required allowances may occur in the future due to changes in the market environment 
the company accounts for the entry of right to use contracts in accordance with the codification topic revenue recognition fasb asc 
a right to use contract gives the customer the right to a set schedule of usage at a specified group of properties 
customers may choose to upgrade their contracts to increase their usage and the number of properties they may access 
a contract requires the customer to make annual payments during the term of the contract and may require an upfront nonrefundable payment 
the stated term of a right to use contract is at least one year and the customer may renew his contract by continuing to make the annual payments 
the company will recognize the upfront non refundable payments over the estimated customer life which  based on historical attrition rates  the company has estimated to be from one to years 
for example  the company has currently estimated that of customers who enter a new right to use contract will terminate their contract after five years 
therefore  the upfront nonrefundable payments from of the contracts entered in any particular period are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of five years as five years is the estimated customer life for of the company s customers who enter a contract 
the historical attrition rates for upgrade contracts are lower than for new contracts  and therefore  the nonrefundable upfront payments for upgrade contracts are amortized at a different rate than for new contracts 
the decision to recognize this revenue in accordance with fasb asc was made after corresponding during september and october with the office of the chief accountant at the sec 
the company continues to monitor customer lives based on historical attrition rates and changes in revenue recognized may occur in the future due to changes in customer behavior 
right to use annual payments by customers under the terms of the right to use contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the one year period in which access to sites at certain properties are provided 
notes and contracts receivable notes receivable generally are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal balances net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans  unamortized discounts or premiums  and an allowance 
interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance 
discounts or premiums are amortized to income using the interest method 
in certain cases the company finances the sales of homes to its customers referred to as chattel loans which loans are secured by the homes 
the valuation of an allowance for doubtful accounts for the chattel loans is calculated based on delinquency trends  average annual default rates  loss rates  and the current estimated market value of the underlying manufactured home collateral 
during the year ended december   the company purchased chattel loans that were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition under the codification topic loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality fasb asc 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this form k for a detailed description of our acquisition 
the fair value of these chattel loans included an estimate of losses that are expected to be incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the receivables  and therefore no allowance for losses was recorded for these chattel loans 
the fair value is estimated based on a number of factors including customer delinquency status  credit scores  the original down payment amount and below market stated interest rates 
through december   the short term historical performance of these loans has indicated a default rate of and a recovery rate of  which are slightly higher than originally estimated 
management regularly reviews these assumptions and may adjust its estimates as needed as more information becomes available 
a probable decrease in management s expectation of future cash collections related to these chattel loans could result in the need to record an allowance for credit losses in the future 
due to the size of the chattel loan pool and maturity dates ranging up to years  future credit losses or changes to interest income could be significant 
the company also provides financing for nonrefundable up front payments on sales of new or upgrades of right to use contracts contracts receivable 
based upon historical collection rates and current economic trends  when an up front payment is financed  a reserve is established for a portion of the contracts receivable balance estimated to be uncollectible 
the reserve and the rate at which the company provides for losses on its contracts receivable could be increased or decreased in the future based on its actual collection experience 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
certain of the company s contracts receivable were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition under the fasb asc the fair value of these contracts receivable included an estimate of losses that were expected to be incurred over the estimated life of the contracts receivable  and therefore no allowance for losses was recorded for these contracts receivable as of the transaction date 
through december   the credit performance of these contracts receivable has been better than the assumptions used in determining its initial fair value  and the company regularly updates its expectations regarding the amounts and timing of future cash flows 
financial instruments that potentially could subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of notes receivable 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes receivable are limited due to the size of the receivable and geographic diversity of the underlying properties 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated investments or joint ventures that it believes have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the company with the opportunity to achieve increases  where justified by the market  as each lease matures 
such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the company 
in addition  the company resort properties are not generally subject to leases and rents are established for these sites on an annual basis 
the company right to use contracts generally provide for an annual dues increase  but dues may be frozen under the terms of certain contracts if the customer is over years old 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the company believes ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is generally an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
the company defines ffo as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company receives up front non refundable payments from the entry of right to use contracts 
in accordance with gaap  the upfront non refundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life 
although the nareit definition of ffo does not address the treatment of nonrefundable right to use payments  the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in its calculation of ffo 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
the company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
the company believes that the adjustment to ffo for the net revenue deferral of upfront non refundable payments and expense deferral of right to use contract commissions also facilitates the comparison to other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
the company computes ffo in accordance with its interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company does 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of its liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates 
the primary market risk the company faces is long term indebtedness  which bears interest at fixed and variable rates 
the fair value of the company s long term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately or approximately billion of the company s outstanding secured debt had fixed interest rates with scheduled maturities from to  which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures 
for each increase in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
for each decrease in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by  there would be no effect on interest expense or cash flows as the outstanding secured debt has fixed interest rates 
the company s million term loan has variable rates based on libor plus to per annum  which the company fixed the underlying libor rate at per annum for the first three years
