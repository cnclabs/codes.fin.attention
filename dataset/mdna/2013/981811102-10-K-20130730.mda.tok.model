item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  describe certain business risks 
consideration should be given to the risk factors described below as well as those in the safe harbor statement at the beginning of this annual report on form k  in conjunction with reviewing the forward looking statements and other information contained in this annual report on form k 
these risks are not the only risks we face 
our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial in our operations 
economic or industry downturns the global recession that began in adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our industries  as well as the industries and businesses of many of our customers and suppliers 
the volatile domestic and global recessionary climate had significant negative impacts on our business 
the global recession  and the sluggish pace of the recovery  resulted in a significant decrease in customer demand throughout nearly all of our markets  including our largest market automotive 

table of contents the impacts of the slow and uneven recovery in customer demand in many of our markets and government measures to aid economic recovery  including various measures intended to provide stimulus to the economy in general or to certain industries  as well as the growing debt levels of the united states and other countries  especially in europe  continue to be unknown 
overall  operating levels across many of our businesses may remain at lower levels until economic conditions improve and demand increases 
while certain sectors of the economy have stabilized and recovered from the economic downturn  we are unable to predict the strength  pace or sustainability of the economic recovery or the effects of government intervention or debt levels 
overall general economic conditions  both domestically and globally  have improved from the lows reached during the recession 
the automotive market has shown signs of strengthening  and the construction market has shown signs of stabilizing 
however  global economic conditions  particularly in europe  remain fragile  and the possibility remains that the domestic or global economies  or certain industry sectors of those economies that are key to our sales  may continue to be slow or could further deteriorate  which could result in a corresponding decrease in demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
the automotive and construction industries account for a significant portion of our net sales  and reduced demand from these industries have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely affect our business 
the overall downturn in the economy  the disruption in capital and credit markets  declining real estate values  high unemployment rates  and reduced consumer confidence and spending caused significant reductions in demand from our end markets in general and  in particular  the automotive and construction end markets 
the domestic automotive industry has improved from its lows in recent years  but it continues to experience a difficult operating environment  which has resulted in and may continue to result in lower levels of vehicle production and an associated decrease in demand for products sold to the automotive industry 
many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers have reduced production levels and eliminated manufacturing capacity  through the closure of facilities  reduction in operations and other cost reduction actions 
the construction industry has shown signs of stabilizing from further erosion 
however  both the automotive and construction markets remain depressed compared to historical norms  and we cannot predict the strength  pace or sustainability of recovery in these markets 
the difficulties faced by the automotive and construction industries have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business 
if demand for the products we sell to the automotive or construction markets were to be further reduced  this could negatively affect our sales  financial results and cash flows 
financial difficulties and bankruptcy filings by our customers could have an adverse impact on our business 
in recent years  many of our customers have experienced and continue to experience challenging financial conditions 
the financial difficulties of certain customers and or their failure to obtain credit or otherwise improve their overall financial condition could result in numerous changes within the markets we serve  including additional plant closings  decreased production  reduced demand  changes in product mix  unfavorable changes in the prices  terms or conditions we are able to obtain and other changes that may result in decreased purchases from us and otherwise negatively impact our business 
these conditions also increase the risk that our customers may delay or default on their payment obligations to us 
the relative weakness of the economy continues the risk that some of our customers have further financial difficulties 
economic conditions remain fragile  and the possibility remains that markets may not fully recover  or could further deteriorate 
should the economy or any of our markets not improve  the risk of bankruptcy filings by and financial difficulties of our customers may increase 
such bankruptcy filings or other financial difficulties may result not only in a reduction in our sales  but also in a loss associated with our potential inability to collect outstanding accounts receivable from the affected customers 
while we have taken and will continue to take steps intended to mitigate the impact of financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy filings by our customers  these matters could have a negative impact on our business 
volatility in the united states and worldwide capital and credit markets has significantly impacted and may continue to significantly impact our end markets and has resulted and may continue to result in negative impacts on demand  increased credit and collection risks and other adverse effects on our business 
the domestic and 
table of contents worldwide capital and credit markets  have experienced significant volatility  disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability 
these factors caused diminished availability of credit and other capital in our end markets  and for participants in  and the customers of  those markets 
although domestic credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis  the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us  our customers and suppliers 
in particular  there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted 
additionally  stricter lending standards have made it more difficult and costly for some firms to access the credit markets 
in addition  uncertainties in europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world will continue to weigh on global and domestic growth 
although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities  these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility 
in addition  restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult  or in some cases  impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations 
lack of  or limited access to  capital would adversely affect our customers ability to purchase our products or  in some cases  to pay for our products on a timely basis 
raw material pricing and availability the costs of manufacturing our products and our ability to supply our customers could be negatively impacted if we experience interruptions in deliveries of needed raw materials or supplies 
if  for any reason  our supply of flat rolled steel or other key raw materials  such as aluminum  zinc or helium  is curtailed or we are otherwise unable to obtain the quantities we need at competitive prices  our business could suffer and our financial results could be adversely affected 
such interruptions could result from a number of factors  including a shortage of capacity in the supplier base of raw materials  energy or the inputs needed to make steel or other supplies  a failure of suppliers to fulfill their supply or delivery obligations  financial difficulties of suppliers resulting in the closing or idling of supplier facilities  other significant events affecting supplier facilities  significant weather events  those factors listed in the immediately following paragraph or other factors beyond our control 
further  the number of suppliers has decreased in recent years due to industry consolidation and the financial difficulties of certain suppliers  and this consolidation may continue 
accordingly  if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted  it may be more difficult to obtain an alternative supply than in the past 
our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices  and we may be unable to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers 
our principal raw material is flat rolled steel  which we purchase from multiple primary steel producers 
the steel industry as a whole has been cyclical  and at times availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include general economic conditions  domestic and worldwide demand  the influence of hedge funds and other investment funds participating in commodity markets  curtailed production from major suppliers due to factors such as the closing or idling of facilities  accidents or equipment breakdowns  repairs or catastrophic events  labor costs or problems  competition  new laws and regulations  import duties  tariffs  energy costs  availability and cost of steel inputs eg  ore  scrap  coke and energy  currency exchange rates and other factors described in the immediately preceding paragraph 
this volatility  as well as any increases in raw material costs  could significantly affect our steel costs and adversely impact our financial results 
if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials  we may not have alternative sources of supply 
in addition  in an environment of increasing prices for steel and other raw materials  competitive conditions may impact how much of the price increases we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  our financial results could be adversely affected 
also  if steel prices decrease  competitive conditions may impact how quickly we must reduce our prices to our customers  and we could be forced to use higher priced raw materials to complete orders for which the selling prices have decreased 
decreasing steel prices could also require us to write down the value of our inventory to reflect current market pricing 

table of contents inventories our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers including  in many cases  short lead times and just in time delivery requirements 
although we typically have customer orders in hand prior to placement of our raw material orders for steel processing  we anticipate and forecast customer demand for each of our operating segments 
we purchase raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon orders  customer volume expectations  historic buying practices and market conditions 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in the use of higher priced inventory to fill orders reflecting lower selling prices  if steel prices have significantly decreased 
these events could adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate demand for our products or if our suppliers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages could result in unfilled orders  negatively impacting our customer relationships and resulting in lost revenues  which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results 
suppliers and customers the loss of significant volume from our key customers could adversely affect us 
a significant loss of  or decrease in  business from any of our key customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial results if we cannot obtain replacement business 
also  due to consolidation in the industries we serve  including the construction  automotive and retail industries  our sales may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments with respect to  one or more of our top customers 
in addition  certain of our top customers may be able to exert pricing and other influences on us  requiring us to market  deliver and promote our products in a manner that may be more costly to us 
moreover  we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  although our customers periodically provide indications of their product needs and purchases  they generally purchase our products on an order by order basis  and the relationship  as well as particular orders  can be terminated at any time 
many of our key industries  such as automotive and construction  are cyclical in nature 
many of our key industries  such as automotive and construction  are cyclical and can be impacted by both market demand and raw material supply  particularly with respect to steel 
the demand for our products is directly related to  and quickly impacted by  customer demand in our industries  which can change as the result of changes in the general united states or worldwide economy and other factors beyond our control 
adverse changes in demand or pricing can have a negative effect on our business 
significant reductions in sales to any of the detroit three automakers could have a negative impact on our business 
approximately half of the net sales of our steel processing operating segment and a significant amount of the net sales of certain joint ventures are to automotive related customers 
although we do sell to the domestic operations of foreign automakers and their suppliers  a significant portion of our automotive sales are to ford  general motors  and chrysler the detroit three automakers and their suppliers 
a reduction in sales for any of the detroit three automakers could negatively impact our business 
in addition  in  automobile producers began taking steps toward complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce 
as automakers work to produce vehicles that comply with these new standards  they may reduce the amount of steel used in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy  thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over supply of steel in north america 
the closing or relocation of customer facilities could adversely affect us 
our ability to meet delivery requirements and the overall cost of our products as delivered to customer facilities are important competitive factors 
if customers close or move their production facilities further away from our manufacturing facilities 
table of contents which can supply them  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet competitive conditions  which could result in the loss of sales 
likewise  if customers move their production facilities overseas  it could result in the loss of potential sales for us 
sales conflicts with our customers and or suppliers may adversely impact us 
in some instances  we may compete with one or more of our customers and or suppliers in pursuing the same business 
in addition  in the engineered cabs business  our customers often have the option of producing certain cabs in house instead of having them supplied by us or our competition 
to the extent they elect to produce such cabs in house  it could adversely affect our sales 
such conflicts may strain our relationships with those parties  which could adversely affect our future business with them 
the closing or idling of steel manufacturing facilities could have a negative impact on us 
as steel makers have reduced their production capacities by closing or idling production lines in light of the challenging economic conditions  the number of facilities from which we can purchase steel  in particular certain specialty steels  has decreased 
accordingly  if delivery from a supplier is disrupted  particularly with respect to certain types of specialty steel  it may be more difficult to obtain an alternate supply than in the past 
these closures and disruptions could also have an adverse effect on our suppliers on time delivery performance  which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our own delivery commitments and may have other adverse effects on our business 
the loss of key supplier relationships could adversely affect us 
over the years  our various manufacturing operations have developed relationships with certain steel and other suppliers which have been beneficial to us by providing more assured delivery and a more favorable all in cost  which includes price and shipping costs 
if any of those relationships were disrupted  it could have an adverse effect on delivery times and the overall cost and quality of our raw materials  which could have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  we do not have long term contracts with any of our suppliers 
if  in the future  we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of steel and other products at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers  we may be unable to obtain these products from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
competition our business is highly competitive  and increased competition could negatively impact our financial results 
generally  the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive 
our competitors include a variety of both domestic and foreign companies in all major markets 
competition for most of our products is primarily on the basis of price  product quality and our ability to meet delivery requirements 
depending on a variety of factors  including raw material  energy  labor and capital costs  government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers  our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 
the economic recession has also resulted in significant open capacity  which could attract increased competitive presence 
competition may also increase if suppliers to or customers of our industries begin to more directly compete with our businesses through new facilities  acquisitions or otherwise 
as noted above  we can have conflicts with our customers or suppliers and  in some cases  supply the same products and services as we do 
increased competition could cause us to lose market share  increase expenditures  lower our margins or offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could adversely impact our financial results 
material substitution if steel prices increase compared to certain substitute materials  the demand for our products could be negatively impacted  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in certain applications  steel competes with other materials  such as aluminum particularly in the automobile industry  cement and wood particularly in the construction industry  composites  glass and plastic 
prices of all of these materials 
table of contents fluctuate widely  and differences between the prices of these materials and the price of steel may adversely affect demand for our products and or encourage material substitution  which could adversely affect prices and demand for steel products 
the high cost of steel relative to other materials may make material substitution more attractive for certain uses 
freight and energy increasing freight and energy costs could increase our operating costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
the availability and cost of freight and energy  such as electricity  natural gas and diesel fuel  is important in the manufacture and transport of our products 
our operations consume substantial amounts of energy  and our operating costs generally increase when energy costs rise 
factors that may affect our energy costs include significant increases in fuel  oil or natural gas prices  unavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts  hurricanes or other natural causes or due to shortages resulting from insufficient supplies to serve customers  or interruptions in energy supplies due to equipment failure or other causes 
during periods of increasing energy and freight costs  we may be unable to fully recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products 
our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to pass all of the increases on to our customers or if we are unable to obtain the necessary freight and energy 
also  increasing energy costs could put a strain on the transportation of our materials and products if the increased costs force certain transporters to close 
information systems we are subject to information system security risks and systems integration issues that could disrupt our internal operations 
we are dependent upon information technology for the distribution of information internally and also to our customers and suppliers 
this information technology is subject to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including  without limitation  computer viruses  security breaches and defects in design 
we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective  not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations 
various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information system and network disruptions and to prevent attempts to gain unauthorized access through the internet to our information systems 
however  a system failure could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
in addition  cyber attacks could threaten the integrity of our trade secrets and sensitive intellectual property 
business disruptions disruptions to our business or the business of our customers or suppliers could adversely impact our operations and financial results 
business disruptions  including increased costs for  or interruptions in  the supply of energy or raw materials  resulting from shortages of supply or transportation  severe weather events such as hurricanes  tsunamis  earthquakes  tornados  floods and blizzards  casualty events such as explosions  fires or material equipment breakdown  acts of terrorism  pandemic disease  labor disruptions  the idling of facilities due to reduced demand resulting from a downturn in economic activity or otherwise or other events such as required maintenance shutdowns  could cause interruptions to our businesses as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers 
while we maintain insurance coverage that can offset some losses relating to certain types of these events  losses from business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results and we could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by insurance or cause some other adverse impact to us 
foreign operations economic  political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international financial results 
although the substantial majority of our business activity takes place in the united states  we derive a portion of our revenues and earnings from operations in foreign countries  and we are subject to 
table of contents risks associated with doing business internationally 
we have wholly owned facilities in austria  canada  poland and portugal and joint venture facilities in china  france  india  mexico  spain and the united kingdom  and are active in exploring other foreign opportunities 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include  among other factors the potential for adverse changes in the local political climate  in diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the united states or in government policies  laws or regulations  terrorist activity that may cause social disruption  logistical and communications challenges  costs of complying with a variety of laws and regulations  difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations  deterioration of foreign economic conditions  especially within europe  inflation and fluctuations in interest rates  currency rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  differing local business practices and cultural considerations  restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply  including energy and raw materials  changes in duties  quotas  tariffs  taxes or other protectionist measures  and potential issues related to matters covered by the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws 
we believe that our business activities outside of the united states involve a higher degree of risk than our domestic activities  and any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the global recession and the volatility of worldwide capital and credit markets have significantly impacted and may continue to significantly impact our foreign customers and markets 
these factors have resulted in decreased demand in our foreign operations and have had significant negative impacts on our business 
refer to the economic or industry downturns risk factor herein for additional information concerning the impact of the global recession and the volatility of capital and credit markets on our business 
joint ventures a change in the relationship between the members of any of our joint ventures may have an adverse effect on that joint venture 
we have been successful in the development and operation of various joint ventures  and our equity in net income from our joint ventures  particularly wave  has been important to our financial results 
we believe an important element in the success of any joint venture is a solid relationship between the members of that joint venture 
if there is a change in ownership  a change of control  a change in management or management philosophy  a change in business strategy or another event with respect to a member of a joint venture that adversely impacts the relationship between the joint venture members  it could adversely impact that joint venture 
in addition  joint ventures necessarily involve special risks 
whether or not we hold a majority interest or maintain operational control in a joint venture  our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals 
for example  our partners may exercise veto rights to block actions that we believe to be in our best interests  may take action contrary to our policies or objects with respect to our investments  or may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations or commitments to the joint venture 
acquisitions we may be unable to successfully consummate  manage or integrate our acquisitions 
a portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions 
we may from time to time continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses  enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths 
there are no assurances  however  that any acquisition opportunities will arise or  if they do  that they will be consummated  or that any needed additional financing for such opportunities will be available on satisfactory terms when required 
in addition  acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations  that business judgments concerning the value  strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect  that we may assume unknown liabilities from the seller  that the acquired businesses may not be integrated successfully and that the acquisitions may strain our management resources or divert management s attention from other business concerns 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
failure to successfully integrate any of our acquisitions may cause significant operating inefficiencies and could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

table of contents capital expenditures our business requires capital investment and maintenance expenditures  and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
many of our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended may   our total capital expenditures  including acquisitions and investment activity  were approximately million 
additionally  at may   we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating lease agreements 
our business also requires expenditures for maintenance of our facilities 
we currently believe that we have adequate resources including cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities  availability under existing credit facilities and unused lines of credit to meet our cash needs for normal operating costs  capital expenditures  debt repayments  dividend payments  future acquisitions and working capital for our existing business 
however  given the current challenges  uncertainty and volatility in the domestic and global economies and financial markets  there can be no assurance that our capital resources will be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
litigation we may be subject to legal proceedings or investigations  the resolution of which could negatively affect our results of operations and liquidity in a particular period 
our results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any legal proceedings or investigations which may be pending against us or filed against us in the future 
we are also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks  including  without limitation  potential claims relating to product liability  health and safety  environmental matters  intellectual property rights  taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws  anti bribery laws  competition laws and sales and trading practices 
while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks  the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time 
a future adverse ruling or settlement or an unfavorable change in laws  rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 
accounting and tax estimates we are required to make accounting and tax related estimates  assumptions and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements  and actual results may differ materially from the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we use 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is dependent on future events  or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available to us 
in some cases  these estimates and assumptions are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
some of the estimates  assumptions and judgments having the greatest amount of uncertainty  subjectivity and complexity are related to our accounting for bad debts  returns and allowances  inventory  self insurance reserves  derivatives  stock based compensation  deferred tax assets and liabilities and asset impairments 
our actual results may differ materially from the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
tax laws and regulations tax increases or changes in tax laws could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to tax and related obligations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or do business  including state  local  federal and foreign taxes 
the taxing rules of the various jurisdictions in which we operate or do business often are 
table of contents complex and subject to varying interpretations 
tax authorities may challenge tax positions that we take or historically have taken  and may assess taxes where we have not made tax filings or may audit the tax filings we have made and assess additional taxes 
some of these assessments may be substantial  and also may involve the imposition of penalties and interest 
in addition  governments could impose new taxes on us or increase the rates at which we are taxed in the future 
the payment of substantial additional taxes  penalties or interest resulting from tax assessments  or the imposition of any new taxes  could materially and adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in us tax laws 
potential changes that may adversely affect our financial results include  without limitation  decreasing the ability of us companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the us deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries 
claims and insurance adverse claims experience  to the extent not covered by insurance  may have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we self insure a significant portion of our potential liability for workers compensation  product liability  general liability  property liability  automobile liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce risk  we purchase insurance from highly rated  licensed insurance carriers that cover most claims in excess of the applicable deductible or retained amounts 
we maintain reserves for the estimated cost to resolve open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
the occurrence of significant claims  our failure to adequately reserve for such claims  a significant cost increase to maintain our insurance or the failure of our insurance providers to perform could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
principal shareholder our principal shareholder may have the ability to exert significant influence in matters requiring a shareholder vote and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of worthington industries 
pursuant to our charter documents  certain matters such as those in which a person would attempt to acquire or take control of the company  must be approved by the vote of the holders of common shares representing at least of worthington industries outstanding voting power 
approximately of our outstanding common shares are beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by john p 
mcconnell  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
as a result of his beneficial ownership of our common shares  mr 
mcconnell may have the ability to exert significant influence in these matters and other proposals upon which our shareholders may vote 
key employees if we lose our senior management or other key employees  our business may be adversely affected 
our ability to successfully operate  grow our business and implement our business strategies is largely dependent on the efforts  abilities and services of our senior management and other key employees 
the loss of any of these individuals or our inability to attract  train and retain additional personnel could reduce the competitiveness of our business or otherwise impair our operations or prospects 
our future success will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  such as engineers and other skilled technicians  who have experience in the application of our products and are knowledgeable about our business  markets and products 
we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or other key employees or attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
we have not entered into any formal employment agreements or change in control agreements with our executive officers  and the loss of any member of our management team could adversely impact our business and operations 
additionally  we may modify our management structure from time to time or reduce our overall workforce as we did in certain operating segments during the recent economic downturn  which may create marketing  operational and other business risks 

table of contents credit ratings ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which could make it more difficult for us to raise capital and could increase our financing costs 
any downgrade in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
in addition  the interest rate on our revolving credit facility is tied to our credit ratings  and any downgrade of our credit ratings would likely result in an increase in the current cost of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
difficult financial markets should we be required to raise capital in the future  we could face higher borrowing costs  less available capital  more stringent terms and tighter covenants or  in extreme conditions  an inability to raise capital 
although we currently have significant borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities  should those facilities become unavailable due to covenant or other defaults  or should we otherwise be required to raise capital outside our existing facilities  given the current uncertainty and volatility in the us and global credit and capital markets  our ability to access capital and the terms under which we do so may be negatively impacted 
any adverse change in our access to capital or the terms of our borrowings  including increased costs  could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
environmental  health and safety we may incur additional costs related to environmental and health and safety matters 
our operations and facilities are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety 
failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws and regulations or with the permits required for our operations could result in increased costs and capital expenditures and potentially fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
over time  we and predecessor operators of our facilities have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
environmental liabilities  including cleanup obligations  could exist at our facilities or at off site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of or at facilities we have divested  which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits and cash flow 
we may be held strictly liable for any contamination of these sites  and the amount of any such liability could be material 
under the joint and several liability principle of certain environmental laws  we may be held liable for all remediation costs at a particular site  even with respect to contamination for which we are not responsible 
changes in environmental and human health and safety laws  rules  regulations or enforcement policies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
legislation and regulations certain proposed legislation and regulations may have an adverse impact on the economy in general and in our markets specifically  which may adversely affect our business 
our business may be negatively impacted by a variety of new or proposed legislation or regulations 
for example  legislation and regulations proposing increases in taxation on  or heightened regulation of  carbon or other greenhouse gas emissions may result in higher prices for steel  higher prices for utilities required to run our facilities  higher fuel costs for us and our suppliers and distributors and other adverse impacts 
see the immediately following risk factor for additional information regarding legislation and regulations concerning climate change and greenhouse gas emissions 
to the extent that new legislation or regulations increase our costs  we may not be able to fully pass these costs on to our customers without a resulting decline in sales and adverse impact to our profits 
likewise  to the extent new legislation or regulations would have an adverse effect on the economy  our markets or the ability of domestic businesses to compete against foreign operations  it could also have an adverse impact on us 

table of contents legislation or regulations concerning climate change and greenhouse gas emissions may negatively affect our results of operations 
energy is a significant input in a number of our operations and products  and many believe that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming 
a number of governments and governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions 
the european union has established greenhouse gas regulations  and canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions 
the us environmental protection agency has issued and proposed regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions  including regulations which will require reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from large sources and suppliers in the united states 
legislation previously has been introduced in the us congress aimed at limiting carbon emissions from companies that conduct business that is carbon intensive 
among other potential items  such bills could include a system of carbon emission credits issued to certain companies  similar to the european union s existing cap and trade system 
several us states have also adopted  and other states may in the future adopt  legislation or regulations implementing state wide or regional cap and trade systems that apply to some or all industries that emit greenhouse gases 
it is impossible at this time to forecast what the final regulations and legislation  if any  will look like and the resulting effects on our business and operations 
depending upon the terms of any such regulations or legislation  however  we could suffer a negative financial impact as a result of increased energy  environmental and other costs necessary to comply with limitations on greenhouse gas emissions  and we may see changes in the margins of our greenhouse gas intensive and energy intensive assets 
in addition  depending upon whether similar limitations are imposed globally  the regulations and legislation could negatively impact our ability to compete with foreign companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations 
many of our customers in the united states  canada and europe may experience similar impacts  which could result in decreased demand for our products 
legislation  regulations or other events which could adversely affect the ability or cost to recover natural gas or oil may negatively affect our business 
in recent years  increasing amounts of oil and natural gas have been produced through the hydraulic fracking process throughout the united states and north america 
this has resulted in decreasing energy costs  particularly for natural gas and similar energy products 
this reduction has been a boon for the us economy and has helped lower energy costs for us businesses 
also  some of our recent acquisitions supply products which are used by companies engaged in hydraulic fracking 
if legislation  regulations or other events limit the ability to recover such fuels through hydraulic fracking or increase the cost thereof  it could have a negative impact on our business  the us economy and us businesses in general  which could result in decreased demand for our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 
the implementation of the provisions of the new health care law could adversely affect our business 
as the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act begin to be fully implemented and governments and employers take action related thereto  the impact on us health care costs are unknown 
many project that there will be a significant increase in health care costs which could adversely impact the us economy and us businesses which could result in a decreased demand for our products 
further  the company s health care costs could increase which would negatively impact our profits 
seasonality our operations have been subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flows for a particular period 
sales are generally strongest in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year when all of our business segments are normally operating at seasonal peaks 
historically  our sales are generally weaker in the third quarter of the fiscal year  primarily due to reduced activity in the building and construction industry as a result of the colder  more inclement weather  as well as customer plant shutdowns in the automotive industry due to holidays 
our quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of large customer orders 
consequently  our cash flow from operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if  as a result of any such fluctuation  our quarterly cash flows were significantly reduced  we may be unable to service our 
table of contents indebtedness or maintain compliance with certain covenants under our credit facilities 
a default under any of the documents governing our indebtedness could prevent us from borrowing additional funds  limit our ability to pay interest or principal and allow our lenders to declare the amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and to exercise certain other remedies 
impairment charges continued or enhanced weakness or instability in the economy  our markets or our results of operations could result in future asset impairments  which would reduce our reported earnings and net worth 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  excluding purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
impairment testing involves a comparison of the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group to its respective carrying amount 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment  if any  to be recognized 
for long lived assets other than goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds fair value 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually  during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may be present 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of each reporting unit  determined using discounted cash flows  to each reporting unit s respective carrying value 
if the estimated fair value of reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  there is no impairment 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a goodwill impairment is indicated 
the amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  to its estimated fair value  with the difference representing the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than its carrying value  the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of earnings 
economic conditions remain fragile  particularly in europe and the possibility remains that the domestic or global economies  or certain industry sectors that are key to our sales  may deteriorate 
if certain of our business segments are adversely affected by the challenging and volatile economic and financial conditions  we may be required to record additional impairments  which would negatively impact our results of operations
