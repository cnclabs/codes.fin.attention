pgi solutions are available via desktops  tablets and mobile devices  helping businesses worldwide be more productive  mobile and environmentally responsible 
we have a global presence in countries in our three segments in north america  europe and asia pacific 
during  we continued our strategy to transition pgi to a saas company  focusing our sales and marketing efforts on growing the market awareness and adoption of our next generation virtual meeting solutions  imeet and globalmeet 
our continuing operations reflect only our meeting solutions 
as a result and except as provided herein  the following discussion and analysis reflects our results from continuing operations 
key highlights of our financial and strategic accomplishments for include generated nearly growth in our net revenues over  despite a negative impact of approximately from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  more than doubled our revenue run rate from imeet and globalmeet exiting the year with an annual revenue run rate of nearly million from these products  repurchased nearly million shares of our common stock in the open market under our prior board approved stock repurchase plan at an average price of per share  representing an aggregate total of approximately million in value returned to our shareholders  and established a new open market share repurchase program for up to million shares of our common stock 
our primary corporate objectives in are focused on continuing to expand our global distribution through an increase in our direct sales headcount  as well as new agents  resellers and strategic alliances with carriers worldwide  in order to further our market reach and accelerate customer awareness and adoption of imeet and globalmeet  develop and release additional upgrades and enhancements to imeet and globalmeet to increase their functionality  improve their competitive positioning and grow their market opportunities  and transition our audio only customers to our more integrated  online meeting solutions that provide a richer  more productive user experience 
we believe these strategic initiatives will increase the addressable market opportunity for pgi and our solutions 
in  approximately of our net revenues were generated in countries outside the united states 
because we generate a significant portion of our net revenues from our international operations  movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results 
we estimate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates during negatively impacted our net revenues by approximately million as compared to we have historically generated net revenue growth in our meeting solutions 
revenue growth is driven primarily by the increase of total minutes sold  partially offset by the decrease of the average rates per minute 
we believe that this trend is consistent with the industry  and we expect it to continue in the foreseeable future 
our business trends and revenue growth continue to be affected by the challenging economic climate  higher global unemployment and lower global business activity 
despite these economic headwinds and continued price compression  our net revenues increased to million in as compared to million in  primarily due to our volume growth 
we have historically used our cash flows from operating activities for debt repayments  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  acquisitions and strategic investments 
as of december   borrowings under our million credit facility  including the uncommitted million accordion feature  were million 
see capital resources for a description of our credit facility 
in addition  we intend to continue to prudently invest in our virtual meeting solutions  specifically in technology innovation and platform development  as well as new market strategies to better meet the needs of our existing customers and to better attract  engage and acquire new customers 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the estimates 
see the section in this annual report entitled critical accounting policies

we incurred the majority of research and development expenses in north america 
consolidated research and development expenses increased million in  primarily driven by additional resources to develop our virtual meeting solutions 
consolidated research and development expenses decreased million in  primarily a result of reduced personnel related costs and differences in the nature of projects for that department 
we were able to capitalize many of the costs incurred associated with enhancements to our virtual meeting solutions  which resulted in a higher capitalization rate of such personnel costs for equity based compensation expense equity based compensation expense for restricted stock awards is included in operating expenses

interest expense the majority of our interest expense from continuing operations is incurred in north america and was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased during primarily as a result of amending our credit facility in december this amendment resulted in lower interest rates and lower debt issuance costs to be amortized over the life of the credit facility 
interest expense was also lower in due to lower debt outstanding 
interest expense decreased during primarily as a result of decreased debt outstanding 
the weighted average outstanding balance on our credit facility was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the decrease in our weighted average debt outstanding in was attributable to our continued efforts to reduce our outstanding debt  including by using a portion of the proceeds from our pgisend sale in unrealized gain on change in fair value of interest rate swaps in august  we entered into two million two year interest rate swaps at a fixed rate of 
in december  we amended the life of one of the million swaps to three years and reduced the fixed rate to 
our million interest rate swap  which had a fixed rate of  expired in august  and our remaining interest rate swap expired in august as of december   we do not have any outstanding interest rate swaps 
we did not initially designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and  as such  we did not account for them under hedge accounting 
during the fourth quarter of  we prospectively designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our interest rate risk associated with our credit facility using the long haul method of effectiveness testing 
concurrent with the refinancing of our credit facility in may  we dedesignated the cash flow hedge associated with our remaining interest rate swap 
any changes in fair value prior to designation as a hedge  subsequent to dedesignation as a hedge  and any ineffectiveness while designated were recognized as unrealized gain on change in fair value of interest rate swaps as a component of other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations and amounted to a gain of million in other  net other  net was a loss of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
other  net was comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to cash settlements of intercompany transactions and the revaluation of foreign currency denominated payables and receivables into their respective functional currency

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities consolidated operating cash flows from continuing operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income from continuing operations for each of the years ended december  and cash used in provided by investing activities consolidated investing activities from continuing operations used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and provided cash of million for the year ended december  the principal uses of cash in investing activities in included million of capital expenditures and million invested in a privately held cloud service marketplace company

excise and sales tax some of our solutions may be subject to telecommunications excise tax and sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers 
during the year ended december  no payments were made  and during the year ended december  we paid million  respectively  of tax and interest related to the settlement of these state excise and sales tax contingencies 
we have reserves for certain state excise and sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation 
these contingencies are included in accrued taxes  other than income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december  and december   we had reserved million and million  respectively  for certain state excise and sales tax contingencies and interest 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies 
in the event that actual results differ from these reserves  we may need to make adjustments  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  states may disagree with our method of assessing and remitting such taxes or additional states may subject us to inquiries regarding such taxes 
capital resources our credit facility consists of a million revolver  a million term a loan and an uncommitted million accordion feature 
our subsidiary  ats  is the borrower under our credit facility  with pgi and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries guaranteeing the obligations of ats under the credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  we have pledged as collateral all of the issued and outstanding stock of our material domestic subsidiaries and of our material foreign subsidiaries 
proceeds drawn under our credit facility can be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the annual interest rate applicable to borrowings under our credit facility  at our option  is the base rate the greater of either the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent  the prime rate or one month libor plus one and one half percent plus an applicable percentage that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio at quarter end  or libor for one  two  three  six  nine or twelve months adjusted for a percentage that represents the federal reserve board s reserve percentage plus an applicable percentage that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio at quarter end 
the applicable percentage for base rate loans and libor loans were and  respectively  at december  under our credit facility 
our interest rate on libor loans  which comprised materially all of our outstanding borrowings as of december   was 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of our credit facility that is based on our consolidated leverage ratio at quarter end 
as of december   the rate applied to the unused portion of our credit facility was 
our credit facility contains customary terms and restrictive covenants  including financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility 
at december   we have utilized million of our million credit facility  with million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates on interest payments associated with our credit facility 
as of december   we have no outstanding interest rate swaps 
at the scheduled maturity of our credit facility in december  or in the event of an acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility following an event of default  the entire outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness under the facility  together with all other amounts payable thereunder  will become due and payable 
we may not have sufficient funds to pay such obligations in full at maturity or upon such acceleration 
if we default and are not able to pay any such obligations due  our lenders have liens on substantially all of our assets and could foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our obligations 
we regularly review our capital structure and evaluate potential alternatives in light of current conditions in the capital markets 
depending upon conditions in these markets  cash flows from our segments and other factors  we may engage in other capital transactions 
these capital transactions include  but are not limited to  debt or equity issuances or credit facilities with banking institutions 
liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and equivalents compared to million as of december  cash balances residing outside of the united states as of december  were million compared to million as of december  as we generate positive cash flows in the united states  we currently do not foresee a requirement to repatriate the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations or repay domestic obligations 
included in these cash flows are repayments of royalties and management fees charged to international locations from the united states 
we also utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash and cash equivalents available in the locations where they are needed  and  when advantageous  may access foreign cash or cash equivalents in a tax efficient manner 
however  if these funds are needed for our operations in the united states  we could be required to pay additional us taxes to repatriate these funds 
at december   we had million of available credit on our credit facility  without regard to the uncommitted million accordion feature 
we have historically borrowed on our credit facility in order to fund stock repurchases and acquisitions 
we generated positive operating cash flows from each of our geographic segments for the year ended december  we had sufficient cash flows from consolidated operations to service existing debt obligations  to fund capital expenditure requirements and to fund research and development expenses for new services and enhancements to existing services 
assuming no material change to these costs  which we do not anticipate  we believe that we will generate adequate operating cash flows for capital expenditures and contractual commitments and to satisfy our indebtedness and fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and legal contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from continuing operations consist primarily of usage fees generally based on per minute  and prior to our discontinued reclassifications  per fax page or per transaction methods 
to a lesser extent  we charge subscription based and license fees and have fixed period minimum revenue commitments 
revenues related to our virtual meeting solutions primarily consist of usage fees which are recognized ratably over the contracted term of the agreement 
these revenues may also include set up fees and maintenance and update fees  which are typically also recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue that results from non calendar month billing cycles and the one month lag time in billing related to certain of our services 
deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable prior to the recognition of revenue  we make a decision that collectability is reasonably assured 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as historical and anticipated customer payment performance and industry specific economic conditions 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets and long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
goodwill is not subject to amortization  but is subject to an impairment assessment performed at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment are identified 
our reporting units are our operating segments  north america  europe and asia pacific 
we utilize december as our annual date to perform the assessment and adopted the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment standard  applied as of december  under this standard  management qualitatively evaluates whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired 
if we qualitatively conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed with the quantitative two step impairment assessment 
based on our assessment this year  we qualitatively concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of our north america and europe reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values  and thus no quantitative assessment was required 
for our asia pacific reporting unit  we were unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that fair value exceeded carrying value as a result of the qualitative analysis 
therefore  step one of the quantitative impairment test was performed for our asia pacific reporting unit  with estimated fair value exceeding carrying value by more than 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets  and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
net intangible assets and goodwill totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes income taxes are determined under the asset and liability method as required by accounting standards codification  or asc   income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using existing tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary items are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have established valuation allowances of million at december  and million at december  our valuation allowance at december  primarily relates to certain federal and state capital loss carryforwards and foreign and state net operating losses 
current evidence suggests we will not realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character on a jurisdictional basis within the carryforward period to allow us to realize the deferred tax benefits for which we have established a valuation allowance 
net of these valuation allowances  our deferred tax asset as of december  was million and our net deferred tax asset as of december  was million 
we believe that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the tax benefits related to all other deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
we establish reserves against some or all of the tax benefits of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain 
for purposes of evaluation of whether or a not a position is uncertain  we presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority and that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december  and was million and million  respectively 
upon resolution  unrecognized tax benefits of million and million as of december  and  respectively  would affect our annual effective tax rate 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries and routine income tax audits from us and us tax authorities with respect to income taxes which may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits and could also impact estimated income taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our tax provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved or identified 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring costs restructuring accruals are based on certain estimates and judgments related to severance and exit costs  contractual lease obligations and related costs 
our estimated severance costs could be impacted if actual severance payments are different from initial estimates 
contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors
