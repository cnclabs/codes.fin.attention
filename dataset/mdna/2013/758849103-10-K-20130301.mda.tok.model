item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview regency centers corporation began its operations as a reit in and is the managing general partner in regency centers  lp we endeavor to be the preeminent  best in class national shopping center company distinguished by sustaining growth in shareholder value and compounding total shareholder return in excess of our peers 
we work to achieve these goals through reliable growth in net operating income from a portfolio of dominant  infill shopping centers  balance sheet strength  value added development capabilities and an engaged team of talented and dedicated people 
all of our operating  investing  and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as co investment partnerships or joint ventures 
the parent company currently owns approximately of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 
at december   we directly owned shopping centers the consolidated properties located in states representing million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
through co investment partnerships  we own partial ownership interests in shopping centers the unconsolidated properties located in states and the district of columbia representing million square feet of gla 
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores  major retail anchors  restaurants  side shop retailers  and service providers  as well as by ground leasing or selling building pads out parcels to these same types of tenants 
we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
at december   the consolidated shopping centers were leased  as compared to at december  we monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers  especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition  business practice  and store closings in other locations 
we also evaluate consumer preferences  shopping behaviors  and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development 
we will continue to use our development capabilities  market presence  and anchor relationships to invest in value added new developments and redevelopments of existing centers 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and retailers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process typically requires two to three years once construction has commenced  but can vary subject to the size and complexity of the project 
we fund our acquisition and development activity from various capital sources including property sales  equity offerings  and new debt 
co investment partnerships provide us with an additional capital source for shopping center acquisitions  as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management  property management  and other investing and financing services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co investment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we wholly own 
co investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 
although selling properties to co investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest  it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share  to the extent of our ownership interest  in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long term investment strategy 
critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity  and industry accounting standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness  however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
accounts receivable minimum rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes are the company principal source of revenue 
as a result of generating this revenue  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
to address the collectability of these receivables  we analyze historical write off experience  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
real estate investments acquisition of real estate investments upon acquisition of real estate operating properties  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building  building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships  assumed debt  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition  based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date 
based on these estimates  the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities 
fair value is determined based on an exit price approach  which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
if  up to one year from the acquisition date  information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis 
the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 
we strategically invest in entities that own  manage  acquire  develop and redevelop operating properties 
we analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated 
if it is determined that these investments do not require consolidation because the entities are not variable interest entities vies  we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities determined to be vies  we do not have voting control  and or the limited partners or non managing members have substantive participatory rights  then the selection of the accounting method used to account for our investments in real estate partnerships is generally determined by our voting interests and the degree of influence we have over the entity 
management uses its judgment when making these determinations 
we use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we own or more of the voting interests and have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest  or if we own less than of the voting interests but have determined that we have significant influence 
under the equity method  we record our investments in and advances to these entities in our consolidated balance sheets  and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the joint venture is recognized in equity in income loss of investments in real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations 
development of real estate assets and cost capitalization we capitalize the acquisition of land  the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy  costs are no longer capitalized 
other specifically identifiable development costs include pre development costs essential to the development process  as well as  interest  real estate taxes  and direct employee costs incurred during the development period 
pre development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits  legal  engineering  and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
at december  and  the company had capitalized pre development costs of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were refundable deposits 
if we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed  we immediately expense all related capitalized pre development costs not considered recoverable 
during the years ended december    and  we expensed pre development costs of approximately million   and  respectively  recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended 
we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond months after substantial completion of the building shell 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized interest of million  million  and million  respectively  on our development projects 
we have a staff of employees who directly support our development program 
all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program 
the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring 
valuation of real estate investments we evaluate whether there are any indicators that have occurred  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that would result in us determining that the carrying value of our real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may not be recoverable 
if such indicators occur  we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions  including rental rates  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions  anticipated hold period  and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition  including the exit capitalization rate 
these key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment  if any  could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arms length transaction 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 
changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group  which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the company financial condition or operating performance 
we evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators  including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired 
an investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other than temporary basis 
cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other than temporary 
these factors include the age of the real estate partnerships  our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity  the financial condition and long term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks 
if we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary  no impairment charge is recorded 
if our analysis indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnerships  the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment 
the fair value of real estate investments is highly subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available  or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization or the traditional discounted cash flow methods 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors  and therefore are subject to a significant degree of management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value 
in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land  we generally use market data and comparable sales information

we will continue to closely monitor the pending sale and the impact  if any  on its shopping centers 
although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 
we monitor industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales  lack of credit  changes in retail formats or increased competition 
as a result of our findings  we may reduce new leasing  suspend leasing  or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer 
we monitor the financial condition of our tenants 
we communicate often with those tenants who have announced store closings or filed bankruptcy

during the year ended december   a million provision for impairment was recognized as a result of identifying properties that had been previously considered held for long term investment and determining that they no longer met our long term investment strategy 
as a result of this re evaluation  we changed our expected investment holding period and reduced our carrying value to estimated fair value

the company recognized a million expense for the early extinguishment of this debt 
the million increase in net investment income from deferred compensation plan related to the change in the fair value of plan assets from december  to december  and is consistent with the change in plan liabilities

our diluted net income per unit was for the year ended december  as compared to diluted net loss per unit of for the year ended december  supplemental earnings information we use certain non gaap performance measures  in addition to the required gaap presentations  as we believe these measures are beneficial to us in improving the understanding of the company operational results among the investing public 
we believe such measures make comparisons of other reits operating results to the company more meaningful 
we continually evaluate the usefulness  relevance  and calculation of our reported non gaap performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public  and thus such reported measures could change 
the following are our definitions of same property net operating income noi  funds from operations ffo  and core ffo  which we believe to be beneficial non gaap performance measures used in understanding our operational results same property noi includes only the net operating income of comparable operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and this excludes all properties in development and non same properties 
a non same property is a property acquired during either period being compared or a development completion that is less than funded or features less than two years of anchor operations 
in no event can a development completion be termed a non same property for more than two years 
as such  same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development  acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented  and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of our properties 
noi is calculated as total property revenues minimum rent  percentage rents  and recoveries from tenants and other income less direct property operating expenses operating and maintenance and real estate taxes from the properties owned by the company  and excludes corporate level income including management  transaction  and other fees  for the entirety of the periods presented 
ffo is a commonly used measure of reit performance  which the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property  net of tax  excluding operating real estate impairments  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with nareit definition 
many companies use different depreciable lives and methods  and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions 
since ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions  and impairments  it can provide a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  acquisition and development activities  and financing costs 
this provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap 
thus  ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure of our operating performance  which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore  should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity 
core ffo is an additional performance measure we use as the computation of ffo includes certain non cash and non comparable items that affect our period over period performance 
core ffo excludes from ffo  but is not limited to  transaction income or expense  gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt  development and outparcel gains and losses and other non core items 
we provide a reconciliation of ffo to core ffo as shown below 
the company reconciliation of property revenues and property expenses to same property noi for the years ended december  and is as follows in thousands same property other total same property other total income loss from continuing operations less management  transaction  and other fees other plus depreciation and amortization general and administrative other operating expense  excluding provision for doubtful accounts other expense income equity in income loss of investments in real estate excluded from noi income tax expense of taxable reit subsidiary noi from properties sold noi includes revenues and expenses attributable to non same property  development  and corporate activities

environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry  the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers  and underground petroleum storage tanks 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites 
we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 
at december  we had reserves of million for our pro rata share of environmental remediation  primarily from property acquisitions 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity  or results of operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  inflation may become a greater concern in the future 
substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
however  during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness  minimum rents and percentage rents may decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines 
occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk we have a million line commitment and a million term loan commitment  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon a annual rate of libor plus basis points and our term loan has a variable interest rate of libor plus basis points 
libor rates charged on our line commitment and our term loan collectively our unsecured credit facilities change monthly 
the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings 
if our credit ratings are downgraded  the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase  resulting in higher interest costs 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long term fixed rate debt 
the objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection 
we have million of fixed rate debt maturing in and that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of  which includes million of unsecured long term debt that matures in april we also have million of unsecured long term debt that matures in in order to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising before we obtain new unsecured borrowings in and  we entered into five forward starting interest rate swaps during december  for the same ten year periods we expect for our future borrowings 
these swaps total million of notional value  with weighted average fixed ten year swap rates of for those starting in and for those starting in  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments 
based upon the current capital markets  our current credit ratings  our current capacity under our line and term loan  and the number of high quality  unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings  we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund these debt obligations 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  excluding interest expense  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december   by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table  those rates represent rates that existed at december  and are subject to change on a monthly basis 
the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
since firm commitments are not presented  the table has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate for all fixed rate debt variable rate libor debt average interest rate for all variable rate debt average interest rates at the end of each year presented
