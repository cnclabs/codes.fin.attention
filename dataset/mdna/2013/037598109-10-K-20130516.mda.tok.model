overview we are a leader in certain technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company transitioned to four segments in fiscal  which reflects the separation of the architectural products and services 
table of contents segment into the architectural glass  architectural framing systems and architectural services segments 
the large scale optical technologies lso segment remains unchanged 
all information in this annual report on form k has been recast to conform to this new segment reporting structure 
the company four reportable segments are architectural glass  architectural framing systems  architectural services and lso 
our architectural glass segment consists of viracon  a fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets 
the architectural framing systems segment companies design  engineer and fabricate the aluminum frames used in customized aluminum and glass window  curtainwall  storefront and entrance systems comprising the outside skin and entrances of commercial and institutional buildings 
we have aggregated three operating segments into the architectural framing systems reporting segment based upon their similar products  customers  distribution methods  production processes and economic characteristics wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of standard and custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall for the north american commercial construction market  tubelite  a fabricator of aluminum storefront  entrance and curtainwall products for the us commercial construction industry  and linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters for us markets 
the architectural services segment consists of harmon  one of the largest us full service companies that designs  engineers  fabricates and installs the walls of glass and windows comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings for new construction and renovation 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  a manufacturer of value added glass and acrylic for the custom picture framing and fine art market 
the following highlights the results for fiscal the architectural glass segment operating results improved by million  primarily due to improved architectural glass pricing  a better mix of business  and improved operating performance and cost management 
the architectural framing systems segment benefited from market share gains in target markets and from launching new products  driving a net sales increase of percent and an operating income improvement of percent 
the architectural services segment saw a percent improvement in net sales compared to fiscal  largely due to revenue growth related to expansion of our domestic footprint 
the lso segment saw operating income increase percent on flat revenues due to good manufacturing performance 
during fiscal  the lso segment introduced new glass and acrylic products  and entered new international picture framing markets 
consolidated backlog was million at march   up percent over fiscal levels 
strategy architectural glass  architectural framing systems and architectural services segments all of these segments serve the commercial construction market  which is highly cyclical 
they participate in various phases of the value chain to design  engineer  manufacture and install customized aluminum and glass window  curtainwall  and storefront and entrance systems for commercial buildings each with nationally recognized brands and leading positions in their target market segments 
the window  curtainwall  and storefront systems manufactured by our architectural framing systems segment  as well as the glass products fabricated by our architectural glass segment  are sold to installers who enclose commercial buildings  such as offices  hospitals  educational facilities  government facilities  high end multi family buildings and retail centers 
we believe building contractors and architects value our ability to deliver quality  customized window and curtainwall solutions 
their customers building owners and developers value the distinctive look  energy efficiency  and hurricane and blast protection features of our window and curtainwall systems 
these benefits can contribute to higher lease rates  lower operating costs due to the energy efficiency of our value added glass  a more comfortable environment for building occupants  and protection for buildings and occupants from hurricanes and blasts 
our architectural services segment provides services to fabricate and install glass window and curtainwall systems on newly constructed commercial buildings as well as providing large scale retrofit services for the window and curtainwall systems on existing commercial buildings 
we collaborate closely with our customers  the general contractors  to complete installation projects on time and on budget in order to minimize costly job site labor overruns 
we look at several market indicators  such as office space vacancy rates  architectural billing statistics  employment and other economic indicators  to gain insight into the commercial construction market 
one of our primary indicators is us non residential construction market activity as documented by mcgraw hill construction mcgraw hill  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends 
we utilize the information for the building types that we typically serve office towers  hotels  retail centers  education facilities and dormitories  health care facilities  government buildings and high end multi family buildings and adjust this information which is based on construction starts to align with our fiscal year and the lag that is required to account for when our products and services typically are initiated in a construction project approximately eight 
table of contents months after project start 
from the mcgraw hill data  our us markets had a compound annual growth rate of negative percent over our past three fiscal years  while our combined architectural segments domestic compound annual growth rate was negative percent over that same period 
our overall strategy in these segments is to grow faster than our commercial construction markets through new products  new geographies and new markets  while remaining focused on distinctive solutions for enclosing commercial buildings 
we draw upon our leading brands  energy efficient products and reputation for high quality and service in pursuit of our strategies 
each of our operating segments has the ability to grow through geographic or product line expansion  and we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities in complementary markets 
finally  we aspire to lead our markets in the development of practical  energy efficient products for green buildings for new construction and renovation 
we have introduced products and services designed to meet the growing demand for green building materials 
these products have included new energy efficient glass coatings  thermally enhanced aluminum framing systems  and systems with a high percentage of recycled content 
during fiscal  we began to restore pricing of our architectural glass segment products to better reflect the value our products deliver to the marketplace  and have seen the benefits of those price increases during fiscal in addition  we have been and continue to take measures to keep our cost structure in line with revenue  including continuing to focus on productivity while maintaining and upgrading our capacity to gain market share 
we acquired glassec  a leading architectural glass fabricator in brazil  in november  establishing an architectural glass footprint in a developing and fast growing market where we can provide technical and operational excellence 
we have been successful in winning and profitably executing installation and storefront work in new domestic metropolitan markets 
we are focusing on renovation of window and curtainwall systems where all sectors are increasing their interest in upgrading the fa ades and improving the energy efficiency of their buildings 
during fiscal  we made capital investments for growth  to improve productivity  and for new products and capabilities 
during fiscal  we will make investments for growth  productivity and product development capabilities  including a new state of the art coater in our architectural glass segment 
lso segment our basic strategy in this segment is to convert the custom picture framing market from clear uncoated glass and acrylic products to value added products that protect art from uv damage while minimizing reflection from the glass  so that viewers see the art rather than the glass 
we estimate that over percent of the us picture framing market has converted to value added glass 
although we are finding it more difficult to convert the remaining market  we continue to see conversion in the us market 
we offer a variety of products with varying levels of reflection control and promote the benefits to consumers with point of purchase displays and other promotional materials 
over the past four years  we have entered the global fine art market  which includes museums and private art collections 
this market appreciates the conservation and anti reflective properties of our products  primarily our acrylic products 
acrylic is a preferred material in the fine art market because the product is light weight  which allows for art that is much larger and for which weight is an important consideration 
we have developed several acrylic products to support this market 
in fiscal  we began selling our custom picture framing glass and acrylic in europe where  historically  we have had very little presence 
we have had success in entering new international markets during fiscal we believe our products and distribution networks will enable us to grow at a faster pace internationally than in the united states 
results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased percent during fiscal largely due to share gains through domestic geographic expansion and increased penetration in target markets in the architectural services and architectural framing systems segments  representing approximately percentage points of the increase 
improved pricing in the architectural glass segment also had a favorable impact on fiscal revenues  representing another approximately percentage points of the increase over fiscal fiscal included weeks compared to the prior year week period  which had a negative impact of approximately percentage points on current year sales 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased percent during fiscal  despite flat market conditions  due primarily to market share gains in the architectural framing systems segment  representing approximately percentage points of the increase 
improved pricing in the architectural glass segment contributed approximately percentage points of the increase 
the glassecviracon business within our architectural glass segment that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal accounted for percentage points of the increase in fiscal in addition  fiscal included weeks compared to the prior year week period  which had a percent favorable impact on current year sales 
these items were partially offset by volume declines in the architectural glass segment during fiscal of approximately percentage points 
performance the relationship between various components of operations  as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other expense income  net earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net earnings loss effective income tax rate for continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit was up percentage points due to improved pricing in the architectural glass segment  productivity improvements across all segments  and the margin impact from the revenue growth in the architectural services and architectural framing systems segments 
in addition  we benefited from completing higher margin work and positive project execution in the architectural services segment 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending was up million 
the increase in spending was primarily due to increased expense for incentive compensation programs  as company operating performance improved 
this was partially offset by a decrease in costs related to the chief executive officer ceo transition that were included in fiscal sg a expenses 
fiscal income tax expense returned to normal levels as compared to fiscal  which included tax benefits from credits and deductions on a low base of earnings and the impact of statute of limitation expirations for prior fiscal years 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit was up percentage points in fiscal due to higher pricing in the architectural glass segment and the margin impact from revenue growth in the architectural framing systems segment  partially offset by lower margin work in the architectural services segment 
fiscal also benefited from a reduction in costs incurred to resolve product quality concerns within the architectural glass segment 
sg a expenses decreased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending was up million 
approximately half of the increase in spending related to the impact of the addition of the glassecviracon business 
transition costs related to our retiring ceo and hiring our new ceo  increased commissions as a result of increased sales  and increased promotional costs in our lso segment also contributed to the increase in spending 
fiscal income tax expense on pre tax income was more than offset by tax benefits from credits and deductions on a low base of earnings and the impact of statute of limitation expirations for prior fiscal years 

table of contents segment analysis architectural glass in thousands net sales operating loss operating loss as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales decreased million or percent from fiscal revenues were down percentage points attributable to volume decreases  partially offset by a percentage point increase in net sales from improved pricing 
the volume declines were largely due to a planned decline in export sales as we focus on more profitable domestic projects  as well as the impact of exchange rates on our brazilian business 
for fiscal  the segment incurred an operating loss of million  with an operating margin of negative percent  compared to an operating loss of million and a negative operating margin of percent in fiscal the fiscal improvement was primarily due to the improved pricing noted above  a better mix of business  and improved operating performance and management of fixed costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales increased million  or percent  from fiscal  primarily due to the addition of glassecviracon  which accounted for approximately percentage points of the increase 
improved pricing drove another approximately percentage points of the increase  with a partial offset due to a slight decline in volume 
for fiscal  the segment incurred an operating loss of million  with an operating margin of negative percent  compared to an operating loss of million and a negative operating margin of percent in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to improved pricing  a reduction in costs incurred to resolve product quality concerns and other cost reductions 
architectural framing systems in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales increased million  or percent  over fiscal volume growth was driven by the storefront and window businesses  including share gains in target markets and domestic geographic expansion 
fiscal operating income was million  with an operating margin of percent  compared to million and an operating margin of percent in fiscal the fiscal improvement was primarily due to leverage on net sales growth in the segment  as well as better operating performance throughout the segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales increased million  or percent  over fiscal volume growth and increased market share in the storefront and window businesses drove the year on year improvement 
fiscal operating income was million  with an operating margin of percent  compared to million and an operating margin of percent in fiscal the improved operating results were primarily due to leverage on net sales growth 
architectural services in thousands net sales operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales increased million  or percent  over fiscal revenue growth due to expansion of our domestic footprint accounted for the majority of the increase  or approximately percentage 
table of contents points 
the remaining percentage points of the increase were due to increased volume serviced from our remaining domestic regions 
for fiscal  the segment incurred an operating loss of million  with an operating margin of negative percent  compared to an operating loss of million and a negative operating margin of percent in fiscal the fiscal improvement was primarily due to the leverage on the net sales growth discussed above and positive project execution 
these items were partially offset by costs incurred in the current fiscal year to start the domestic geographic expansion 
in fiscal the segment was still working off projects that were bid at lower margins  but began to see higher margin projects positively impact its results 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales were down million  a percent decline from fiscal  due to weak market conditions 
in fiscal  the segment incurred an operating loss of million  with a negative operating margin of percent  compared to operating income of million and an operating margin of percent in fiscal the decrease was due to reduced volume and lower margin work in this business  as it was working on projects that were bid at lower margins  while retaining key resources in preparation for market recovery and geographic expansion 
large scale optical technologies lso in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues were relatively flat to fiscal  increasing percent in fiscal operating income as a percent of sales increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  with an increase of million in operating income 
a strong mix of value added picture framing product sales in fiscal was somewhat offset by lower volume partially due to one less week in the current year 
the segment also continued to experience strong operating performance  which contributed to the improved margins in the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues increased million  or percent  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal with an increase in sales to independent framers 
the extra week in fiscal had a positive impact of percentage points on sales 
lso segment operating income as a percent of sales decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal and operating income was down million 
although we maintained a strong mix of value added picture framing product sales in fiscal  margins were negatively impacted by spending on sales  marketing and new market development initiatives  including international expansion 
consolidated backlog at march   our consolidated backlog was million  up percent over the march  levels 
we expect percent of our total march  backlog to be recognized in fiscal revenue 
we view backlog as an important statistic in evaluating the level of sales activity and short term sales trends in our business 
however  as backlog is only one indicator  and is not an effective indicator of our ultimate profitability  we do not believe that backlog should be used as the sole indicator of future earnings of the company 
discontinued operations in several transactions in fiscal years through  we completed the sale of our large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of our detention security business and the exit from international curtainwall operations 
the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to these discontinued operations are recorded as liabilities of discontinued operations and cover warranty issues relating to domestic and international construction projects that we expect to be resolved over the next five years 
during fiscal  reductions in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods resulted in non cash  pre tax income from discontinued operations of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  settlement of an outstanding legal claim related to a foreign discontinued operation resulted in a million increase in reserves and a pre tax loss from discontinued operations  which was finalized and paid in march in the second quarter of fiscal  the favorable resolution of an outstanding tax exposure related to a foreign operation discontinued in resulted in the release of million of uncertain tax positions and non cash income from discontinued operations 
the settlements of these two items represented the last significant remaining items with respect to our international curtainwall business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash effect  in thousands operating activities net cash provided by used in continuing operating activities investing activities capital expenditures proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired change in restricted investments  net net purchases sales of marketable securities financing activities proceeds from issuance of debt repurchase and retirement of common stock dividends paid operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  while cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal fiscal and operating cash flows were each positively impacted by the increased income reported for those fiscal years as compared to the respective prior year periods 
fiscal operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the loss from operations in that fiscal year 
non cash working capital current assets  excluding cash and short term marketable securities available for sale and short term restricted investments  less current liabilities was million at march   or percent of fiscal net sales  our key metric for measuring working capital efficiency 
this compares to million at march   or percent of fiscal net sales  and million at february  or percent of fiscal net sales 
we believe that we have continued to manage working capital effectively while growing the business 
investing activities 
investing activities used cash of million in fiscal  provided cash of million in fiscal  and used cash of million in fiscal the current year included new capital investments of million for growth and productivity improvements  as well as new product introductions and maintenance capital 
net purchases of million for restricted investments during the period were the result of million of industrial development bonds reflected in financing activities that were made available for current and future investment in our storefront and entrance business in michigan  the proceeds of which are reported as restricted investments until disbursed 
we increased our investments in marketable securities by million in fiscal as a result of generating excess cash through operating activities noted above 
fiscal investing activities included million in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of equipment 
net proceeds of million from restricted investments during fiscal resulted from releasing money market funds that were required to cover exposures under letters of credit that were previously held outside of our credit facility 
the net position of our investments for fiscal resulted in million in net sale proceeds  as we sold investments to fund operating activities 
new capital investments in fiscal totaled million  primarily for safety and maintenance projects 
fiscal included million for the acquisition of the glassecviracon business 
fiscal investing activities also included net purchases of restricted investments of million related to the funds received as a result of the recovery zone facility bonds that were made available for future investment in our architectural glass fabrication facility in utah 
the net position of our investments resulted in million in net sales proceeds on marketable securities as we converted those investments to cash equivalents to support higher working capital 
new capital investments for fiscal were million  primarily for safety and maintenance projects 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be to million for investments for growth  productivity and product development capabilities  including a new state of the art coater in our architectural glass segment 
we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  pursue geographic expansion  take actions to manage capacity  further invest in  fully divest and or sell parts of our current businesses 

table of contents at march   we had two sale and leaseback agreements  one for a building that provides an option to purchase the building at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease in and one for equipment that provides an option to purchase the equipment at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease in the leases are classified as operating leases 
we had a deferred gain of million under the sale and leaseback transactions  which is included in the balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the average annual lease payments over the life of the remaining leases are million 
financing activities 
total outstanding borrowings at march  were million  compared to million as of march  and million at february  total debt consists of million of recovery zone facility bonds  million of industrial development bonds  and other debt held by glassecviracon 
the industrial development and recovery zone facility bonds mature in fiscal years through and the other debt matures in fiscal years through at march   million of the recovery zone facility bonds are classified as current as we repaid these bonds related to our utah facility in early fiscal there were small amounts of current debt at march  and february  our debt to total capital ratio was percent at march  and percent at march  during the first quarter of fiscal  million of low interest industrial development bonds were issued and made available for current and future investment in the company s storefront and entrance business in michigan 
the interest rate on the bonds resets weekly and is equal to the market rate of interest earned for similar revenue bonds or other tax free securities 
the bonds will mature in april during fiscal  we entered into an amendment to our existing credit agreement 
the amount of the revolving credit facility was increased from million to million and the expiration date was extended to october our minimum required adjusted debt to ebitda ratio was raised from to 
the credit facility also includes a letter of credit facility in the amount of up to million  the outstanding amounts of which decrease the available commitment 
no other provisions of the original agreement were materially impacted by the amended credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the amended credit agreement as of march  or under the original agreement as of march  letters of credit issued under the facility decrease the amount of available commitment  million was available under the amended facility at march  and million was available under the original facility at march  the credit facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth as defined in the credit facility based on certain quarterly financial calculations 
the minimum required net worth computed in accordance with the credit agreement at march  was million  whereas our net worth as defined in the credit facility was million 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to ebitda ratio of not more than 
this ratio is computed quarterly  with ebitda computed on a rolling four quarter basis 
for purposes of calculating the adjusted debt in the adjusted debt to ebitda ratio  we reduce non credit facility debt for up to million to the extent of unrestricted cash balances  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities available for sale in excess of million 
our ratio was at march  if we are not in compliance with either of these covenants  the lenders may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
at march   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit facility 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of  shares of common stock 
the board of directors increased this authorization by  shares in january and by  in october there were no share repurchases during fiscal  during fiscal  we repurchased  shares 
we have purchased a total of  shares  at a total cost of million  since the inception of this program 
we have remaining authority to repurchase  shares under this program  which has no expiration date 
in addition to the shares repurchased under the repurchase plan  we also acquired million and million of company stock from employees in order to satisfy stock for stock option exercises or withholding tax obligations related to stock based compensation  pursuant to terms of board and shareholder approved compensation plans during fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents other financing activities 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity as of march  future cash payments due by fiscal period in thousands thereafter total continuing operations industrial revenue bonds recovery zone facility bonds other debt obligations operating leases undiscounted purchase obligations other obligations total cash obligations from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment  hardware  software and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
we have purchase obligations for raw material commitments and capital expenditures 
as of march   these obligations totaled million 
in december  we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a us dollar notional value of million with the objective of reducing the exposure to fluctuations in the euro related to a planned capital equipment purchase 
the fair value of this contract was a net liability of million at march  and is included in the balance sheet caption as other current liabilities 
we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge as a component of other comprehensive income  and any gain or loss is included in the value of the capital asset and will be recognized in earnings over the life of the asset 
the other obligations in the table above relate to non compete and consulting agreements with former employees 
we expect to make contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plans in fiscal  which will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 
as of march   we had million and million of unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities  respectively 
we expect approximately million of the unrecognized tax benefits to lapse during the next months 
we are unable to reasonably estimate in which future periods the remaining unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities will ultimately be settled 
at march   we had ongoing letters of credit related to construction contracts and certain industrial development and recovery zone facility bonds 
the company s million of industrial revenue bonds are supported by million of letters of credit that reduce availability of funds under our million credit facility 
the million of recovery zone facility bonds are supported by million of letters of credit 
the letters of credit by expiration period were as follows at march  amount of commitment expiration per fiscal period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit in addition to the above standby letters of credit  which were predominantly issued for our industrial development and recovery zone facility bonds  we are required  in the ordinary course of business  to provide surety or performance bonds that commit payments to our customers for any non performance by us 
at march   million of our backlog was bonded by performance bonds with a face value of million 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  as we are released 
table of contents from the bonds upon completion of the contract 
we have never been required to pay on these performance based bonds with respect to any of our current portfolio of businesses 
we believe that current cash on hand and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility  as well as the expected cash to be generated from future operating activities  will be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividend payments over the next months 
we have total cash and short term marketable securities available for sale of million  and million available under our credit facility at march  we believe that this will provide us with the financial strength to work through the ongoing weak market conditions and to continue our growth strategy through the recovery 
off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements at march  or march  outlook the following statements are based on our current expectations for fiscal results 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
revenue growth in the high single digits over fiscal we anticipate earnings per share of to 
capital expenditures are projected to be to million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see new accounting standards set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future  which is incorporated by reference herein 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes  and believes those policies and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for future events 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management is required to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business and in the understanding of our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition our standard product sales terms are free on board fob shipping point or fob destination  and revenue is recognized when title has transferred 
however  our architectural services segment business enters into fixed price contracts for full service commercial building glass installation and renovation services  which are accounted for as construction type contracts 
these contracts are typically performed over a to month timeframe  and we record revenue for these contracts on a percentage of completion basis as we are able to reasonably estimate total contract revenue and total contract costs 
the contracts entered into clearly specify the enforceable rights of the parties  the consideration and the terms of settlement  and both parties can be expected to satisfy all obligations under the contract 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our consolidated sales were recorded on a percentage of completion basis 
under this methodology  we compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract  and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period 
contract costs include materials  labor and other direct costs related to contract performance 
given our ability to make reasonable estimates of our total contract revenues and total contract costs  we believe utilizing the cost to cost method for revenue recognition provides the greatest degree of precision in measuring progress toward completion of the installation contracts 
provisions are established for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in contract revenue only when customers have approved them 
a significant number of estimates are used in these computations 
goodwill impairment to determine if there has been any impairment in accordance with accounting standards  we evaluate the goodwill on our balance sheet annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist through a two step process 
in step one  we value each of our reporting units and compare these values to the reporting units net book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  we perform step two  which determines the amount of goodwill to impair 
each of our six business units represents a reporting unit under applicable accounting standards 
we were not required to perform step two for fiscal  the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded their book value utilizing the discounted cash flow methodology at march  
table of contents although we consider public information for transactions made on businesses similar to ours  since there were no market comparables identified  we base our determination of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments based upon projections of future performance 
in developing our discounted cash flow analysis  assumptions about future revenues and expenses  capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and long term business plan for each of our reporting units 
these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience  anticipated future economic conditions and growth expectations for the industries and end markets in which we participate 
these assumptions are determined over a five year  long term planning period 
the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated 
revenues and operating profit beyond the five year period are projected to grow at a nominal perpetual growth rate for all reporting units 
the discount rate calculations are determined by assuming a company beta  market premium risk  size premium  the cost of debt and debt to capital ratio of a market participant 
a significant change in the factors noted above could cause us to reduce the estimated fair value of some or all of our reporting units and recognize a corresponding impairment of our goodwill in connection with a future goodwill impairment test 
there can be no assurances that these forecasts will be attained 
adverse changes in strategy  market conditions or assumed market capitalization may result in an impairment of goodwill 
reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties from time to time  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving the performance or aesthetics of our architectural products and services 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved  either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement or litigation  can be several years 
while we maintain product liability insurance  the insurance policies include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we reserve based on our estimates of known claims  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales 
self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  employment practices  architect and engineer errors and omissions risk  product re work and other miscellaneous coverages 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  as a result  a material construction project rework event could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management expectations could have a material impact on the company financial condition and operating results 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our management with responsibility for financial reporting  product and project management  quality  legal  tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgments on these future events and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these events are based on the best estimates and judgments of apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consists of municipal bonds 
at march   we had total investments of million  which are considered available for sale securities 
although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and or letter of credit issuer  we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
accordingly  a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our municipal bond portfolio 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations and fixed income securities  as well as market interest rates  to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 

table of contents the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments at march  would result in an approximately million impact to net earnings 
the company investments exceeded its debt at march   so as interest rates increase  net earnings increase  as interest rates decrease  net earnings decrease 
in addition to the market risk related to interest rate changes  the commercial construction markets in which our businesses operate are highly affected by changes in interest rates and  therefore  significant interest rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results 
through our acquisition of glassec in fiscal  we conduct business in a location outside of the united states  and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency  the us dollar 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
the functional currency of glassecviracon is the local currency in the country of domicile  the brazilian real 
we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues  costs  assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies  thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange 
however  our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars  and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between brazilian real and the us dollar 
from time to time  we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks 
as these foreign currency contracts generally have an original maturity date of less than one year  there is no material foreign currency risk 
we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge as a component of other comprehensive income  and any gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction affects net earnings 
our domestic businesses generally sell within the united states  with sales made outside of the united states generally denominated in us dollars
