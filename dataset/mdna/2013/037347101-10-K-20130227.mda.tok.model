except as required by law  we do not intend to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
general the company we were incorporated in maryland on october  and we commenced operations on march  we are in the business of investing primarily in united states  or us  agency mortgage backed securities  or agency mbs  which are securities representing obligations guaranteed by the us government  such as ginnie mae  or guaranteed by federally sponsored enterprises  such as fannie mae or freddie mac 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders based upon the spread between the interest income on our mortgage assets and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of those assets 

table of contents we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  or the code 
as a reit  we routinely distribute substantially all of the taxable income generated from our operations to our stockholders 
as long as we retain our reit status  we generally will not be subject to federal or state taxes on our income to the extent that we distribute our taxable net income to our stockholders 
at december   our qualified reit assets real estate assets  as defined under the code  cash and cash items and government securities were greater than of our total assets  as compared to the code requirement that at least of our total assets must be qualified reit assets 
greater than of our revenue qualified for both the source of income test and the source of income test under the reit rules 
at december   we believe we met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distributions of our taxable net income 
therefore  we believe that we continue to qualify as a reit under the provisions of the code 
pursuant to a management agreement  or the management agreement  between us and anworth management  llc  or the manager  effective as of december   our day to day operations are conducted by the manager 
the manager is supervised and directed by our board of directors and is responsible for i the selection  purchase and sale of our investment portfolio  ii our financing and hedging activities  and iii providing us with management services 
the manager will also perform such other services and activities relating to our assets and operations as may be appropriate 
in exchange for these services  the manager receives a management fee paid monthly in arrears in an amount equal to one twelfth of of our equity as defined in the management agreement 
the initial term of the management agreement will expire on december  and will automatically renew for successive one year terms unless either party elects not to renew 
if we terminate the management agreement or elect not to renew without cause  then we will be required to pay a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee earned during the prior month period 
on september   the federal reserve announced its intention to purchase additional agency mbs at a pace of billion per month 
these purchases will be open ended  meaning that they will continue until the federal reserve is satisfied that economic conditions  primarily in unemployment  improve 
the federal reserve also announced its projection that the federal funds rate would likely remain at exceptionally low levels until at least mid although the us government and other foreign governments have taken various actions including placing fannie mae and freddie mac in conservatorship intended to protect financial institutions  their respective economies and their respective housing and mortgage markets  we continue to operate under very difficult market conditions 
there can be no assurance that these various actions will have a beneficial impact on the global financial markets and  more specifically  the market for the securities we currently own in our portfolio 
we cannot predict what  if any  impact these actions or future actions by either the us government or foreign governments could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these events may impact the availability of financing generally in the marketplace and also may impact the market value of mbs generally  including the securities we currently own in our portfolio 
in august  standard poor s downgraded us sovereign debt  fannie mae and freddie mac from aaa to aa 
we do not know what effect this will ultimately have on the us economy  the value of our securities and the ability of fannie mae and freddie mac to satisfy its guarantees of agency mbs 
on january   the us congress passed the american taxpayer relief act of  or the taxpayer relief act  which extended  for most americans  tax cuts implemented during george h 
bush s administration 
however  the taxpayer relief act delayed the implementation of the budget sequestration provisions of the budget control act of  which provided for automatic federal spending cuts  from january  to march  additionally  it is anticipated that the us government may reach its debt ceiling sometime during at the end of january  congress temporarily increased the debt ceiling amount and deferred any further decision on how to resolve the debt ceiling impasse until may  a failure by the us government to implement the sequestration  resolve the potential debt ceiling crisis  or reduce its budget deficit or a further downgrade of us sovereign debt and government sponsored agencies debt could have a material adverse effect on the us economy and on the global economy 
these events could have a material adverse effect on our borrowing costs  the availability of financing and the liquidity and valuation of securities in general and particularly the securities in our portfolio 

table of contents our portfolio our operations consist of the following portfolios agency mortgage backed securities  or agency mbs  and non agency mortgage backed securities  or non agency mbs

results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december   our net income available to common stockholders was approximately million  or per diluted share  based on a weighted average of million fully diluted shares outstanding 
this includes net income of million minus the payment of preferred dividends of million 
for the year ended december   our net income available to common stockholders was approximately million  or per diluted share  based on a weighted average of million fully diluted shares outstanding 
this included net income of million minus the payment of preferred dividends of million 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  or of gross income  compared to million  or of gross income  for the year ended december  net interest income is comprised of the interest income earned on mortgage investments net of premium amortization expense less interest expense from borrowings 
interest income net of premium amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  due primarily to an increase in premium amortization expense of million and a decrease in the weighted average coupons on agency mbs from in to in  partially offset by an increase in the weighted average portfolio outstanding from approximately billion in to approximately billion in interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  which resulted from a decline in weighted average short term interest rates  after giving effect to the swap agreements  from in to in  partially offset by an increase in the average borrowings outstanding from billion in to billion in recoveries on non agency mbs were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents the results of our operations are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our mbs  the supply of  and demand for  mbs in the marketplace  and the terms and availability of financing 
our net interest income varies primarily as a result from changes in interest rates  the slope of the yield curve the differential between long term and short term interest rates  borrowing costs our interest expense and prepayment speeds on our mbs portfolios  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
interest rates and prepayment speeds  as measured by the constant prepayment rate  vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
with respect to our business operations  increases in interest rates  in general  may  over time  cause i the interest expense associated with our borrowings  which are primarily comprised of repurchase agreements  to increase  ii the value of our mbs portfolios and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to decline  iii coupons on our mbs to reset  although on a delayed basis  to higher interest rates  iv prepayments on our mbs portfolios to slow  thereby slowing the amortization of our mbs purchase premiums  and v the value of our interest rate swap agreements and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to increase 
conversely  decreases in interest rates  in general  may  over time  cause i prepayments on our mbs portfolios to increase  thereby accelerating the amortization of our mbs purchase premiums  ii the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease  iii the value of our mbs portfolios and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to increase  iv the value of our interest rate swap agreements and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to decrease  and v coupons on our mbs to reset  although on a delayed basis  to lower interest rates 
in addition  our borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by the type of collateral pledged and general conditions in the credit markets 
during the year ended december   premium amortization expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million  due primarily to an increase in the amortization of unearned premium on securities acquired in and at higher premiums

there were no components of the derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
during the year ended december   we received proceeds of approximately million on the sale of agency mbs and recognized a gain on sales of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we did not sell any mbs 
total expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we incurred management fees of approximately million  which is based on a percentage of our equity see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
for the year ended december   our average stockholders equity based on a simple average of the stockholders equity at january and december of that year  excluding other comprehensive income  was approximately million 
in contrast  our average stockholders equity for the year ended december  was approximately million 
this increase in average stockholders equity of approximately million had the effect of an increase in the management fee of approximately thousand

financial condition agency mbs portfolio at december   we held agency mortgage assets which had an amortized cost of approximately billion  consisting primarily of approximately billion of adjustable rate agency mbs and approximately billion of fixed rate agency mbs 
this amount represents an approximate increase from the billion held at december  of the adjustable rate agency mbs owned by us  were adjustable rate pass through certificates whose coupons reset within one year 
the remaining consisted of hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs whose coupons will reset between one year and seven years 
hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs have an initial interest rate that is fixed for a certain period  usually three to seven years  and thereafter adjust annually for the remainder of the term of the loan

with respect to our hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs  the fair value of these securities appears on the line associated with the index based on which the security will eventually reset once the initial fixed interest rate period has expired 
the fair value of our agency mbs is reported to us independently from dealers who are major financial institutions and are considered to be market makers for these types of instruments 
for more detail on the fair value of our agency mbs  see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 

table of contents the weighted average coupon and average amortized cost of our agency mbs at december   september   june   march   and december  were as follows december  september  june  march  december  weighted average coupon adjustable rate agency mbs hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs year fixed rate agency mbs year fixed rate agency mbs cmos total agency mbs average amortized cost adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs year fixed rate agency mbs year fixed rate agency mbs total agency mbs current yield weighted average coupon divided by average amortized cost the following information pertains to our repurchase agreement borrowings at december   september   june   march   and december  december  september  june  march  december  dollar amounts in thousands repurchase agreements outstanding average repurchase agreements outstanding average interest rate on outstanding repurchase agreements average days to maturity days days days days days average interest rate on outstanding repurchase agreements after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions weighted average term to next rate adjustment after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions days days days days days weighted average haircuts a haircut represents the reduction of value to securities used as collateral in a lending arrangement so as to provide the lender with a cushion in case the market value of the securities decreases 
at december  and december   the unamortized net premium paid for our agency mbs was approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the current yield declined to from at september  and from at december  this was due primarily to the decline in the weighted average coupon 
as portions of our portfolio reset  and as older assets mature or payoff and are replaced with newer lower yielding assets  the weighted average coupon will continue to decline 
as noted in the trend above  the weighted average coupon has declined by an average of approximately basis points per quarter 
for the three months ended december   the weighted average coupon for our total agency mbs declined by basis points 
one of the factors that 
table of contents also impacts the reported yield on our mbs portfolio is the actual prepayment rate on the underlying mortgages 
we analyze our mbs and the extent to which prepayments impact the yield 
when the rate of prepayments exceeds expectations  we amortize the premiums paid on mortgage assets over a shorter time period  resulting in a reduced yield to maturity on our mortgage assets 
conversely  if actual prepayments are less than the assumed constant prepayment rate  the premium would be amortized over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
the average interest rate on outstanding repurchase agreements after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions declined from at december  to at december  the majority of the decline was due to a decrease in interest rates we paid on our interest rate swap agreements 
please see the discussion on this in the section entitled hedging which follows below 
non agency mbs portfolio non agency mbs are securities issued by companies that are not government or government sponsored enterprises and are secured primarily by first lien residential mortgage loans 
at december   our non agency mbs portfolio consisted of a fair value of thousand of floating rate cmos with an average coupon of  which were acquired at par value 
at december   our non agency mbs portfolio consisted of a fair value of million of floating rate cmos with an average coupon of  which were acquired at par value 
at december   the fair value of our non agency mbs portfolio decreased to approximately thousand from a fair value of approximately million at december  the decrease was due primarily to principal paydowns of approximately million  a decrease in an unrealized gain of approximately million  partially offset by recoveries of approximately million 
at december  and december   the amortized cost of our non agency mbs was zero 
at december   the remaining security representing the principal balance of our non agency mbs portfolio was rated c by moody s investor service and rated d by standard poor s 
we received valuations at december  and december  for the non agency mbs from an independent third party pricing service whose methodologies are based on broker provided pricing as well as indirect observation of market activity and we consider the fair value measurement a level input at december  and december  for more detail on the fair value of our non agency mbs  see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
at december   the fair value of our non agency mbs portfolio was approximately thousand  the principal balance was approximately million and the original principal balance was approximately million 
at december   the fair value of our non agency mbs portfolio was approximately million  the principal balance was approximately million and the original principal balance was approximately million 
at december   and in connection with the subordination levels of non agency mbs securitizations  the average securitization principal subordinate to anworth owned tranches was  the average securitization principal of anworth owned tranches was and the average securitization principal senior to anworth owned tranches was 
at december   the average securitization principal subordinate to anworth owned tranches was  the average securitization principal of anworth owned tranches was and the average securitization principal senior to anworth owned tranches was hedging we periodically enter into derivative transactions  in the form of interest rate swaps  which are intended to hedge our exposure to rising rates on funds borrowed to finance our investments in securities 
we designate interest rate swap transactions as cash flow hedges 
to the extent that we enter into hedging transactions to reduce our interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets  any income or gain 
table of contents from the disposition of hedging transactions should be qualifying income under the reit rules for purposes of the gross income test 
the hedging rules that exclude certain hedging income from the computation of the income test have been extended to exclusion under the income test as well 
to qualify for this exclusion  the hedging transaction must be clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired  originated or entered into 
the transaction must hedge indebtedness incurred or to be incurred by us to acquire or carry real estate assets 
as part of our asset liability management policy  we may enter into hedging agreements such as interest rate caps  floors or swaps 
these agreements are entered into to try to reduce interest rate risk and are designed to provide us with income and capital appreciation in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
we review the need for hedging agreements on a regular basis consistent with our capital investment policy 
at december   we were a counter party to swap agreements  which are derivative instruments as defined by the financial accounting standards board in accounting standards classification  or asc  no 
 with an aggregate notional amount of billion and an average maturity of years 
we utilize swap agreements to manage interest rate risk and do not anticipate entering into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
in accordance with the swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest during the term of the swap agreements and receive a payment that varies with the three month libor rate 
the following table pertains to our interest rate swap agreements at december   september   june   march   and december  december  september  june  march  december  aggregate notional amount of swap agreements billion billion billion billion billion average maturity of swap agreements years years years years years weighted average interest rate paid on swap agreements swap agreements as a percentage of outstanding repurchase agreements the decrease in the weighted average interest rate that we paid on our swap agreements during the year ended december  was due primarily to the maturity of seven swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million with an interest rate of and the addition of swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   there were unrealized losses of approximately million on our swap agreements 
for more information on the amounts  policies  objectives and other qualitative data on our hedge agreements  see notes  and to the accompanying audited financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources agency mbs and non agency mbs portfolios our primary source of funds consists of repurchase agreements which totaled billion at december  as collateral for these repurchase agreements  we have pledged approximately billion in agency mbs 
our other significant source of funds for the year ended december  consisted of payments of principal from our agency mbs portfolio in the amount of billion 
for the year ended december   there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
this consisted of the following components net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
this is comprised primarily of net income of million  adding back the following non cash items the amortization of premium and discounts of approximately million and the 
table of contents amortization of restricted stock of thousand  partially offset by gains on the sale of agency mbs of approximately million and recoveries on non agency mbs of approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities also included a decrease in accrued expenses and payable for securities purchased of approximately million and a decrease in accrued interest payable of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in interest receivable of approximately million  and a decrease in prepaid expense of approximately million  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which consisted of purchases of agency mbs of approximately billion  partially offset by billion from principal payments on agency mbs  proceeds from sales of agency mbs of approximately million  and approximately million in principal payments on non agency mbs  and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
this consisted of borrowings on repurchase agreements of approximately billion  partially offset by repayments on repurchase agreements of approximately billion  net proceeds from common stock issued of approximately million  net proceeds from series a preferred stock issued of approximately thousand  net proceeds of series b preferred stock issued of approximately thousand  less dividends paid of million on common stock and dividends paid of approximately million on preferred stock 
relative to our agency mbs portfolio at december   all of our repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from days to three months 
at december   we had borrowed funds under repurchase agreements with different financial institutions 
as the repurchase agreements mature  we enter into new repurchase agreements to take their place 
because we borrow money based on the fair value of our mbs and because increases in short term interest rates or increasing market concern about the liquidity or value of our mbs can negatively impact the valuation of mbs  our borrowing ability could be reduced and lenders may initiate margin calls in the event short term interest rates increase or the value of our mbs declines for other reasons 
we had adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements during the year ended december  but there can be no assurance we will have adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements in the future 
our leverage on capital including common stockholders equity  all preferred stock and junior subordinated notes decreased from x at december  to x at december  in the future  we expect that our primary sources of funds will continue to consist of borrowed funds under repurchase agreement transactions and of monthly payments of principal and interest on our mbs portfolios 
our liquid assets generally consist of unpledged mbs  cash and cash equivalents 
a large negative change in the market value of our mbs might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
during the year ended december   we raised approximately million in capital under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
at december   our authorized capital included million shares of par value preferred stock  which we have classified as series a cumulative preferred stock  or series a preferred stock  and series b cumulative convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred stock 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at per share  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately thousand 
during the year ended december   we issued an aggregate of  shares of series b preferred stock at a weighted average price of per share  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately thousand 
on may   we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement  or the sales agreement  with cantor to sell up to  shares of our common stock   shares of our series a 
table of contents preferred stock and  shares of our series b preferred stock 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock under the sales agreement  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately thousand 
during the year ended december   we issued an aggregate of  shares of our series b preferred stock under the sales agreement at a weighted average price of per share  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately thousand  net of sales commissions less reimbursement of fees 
during the year ended december   we did not issue any shares of common stock under the sales agreement 
at december   there were  shares of common stock   shares of series a preferred stock and  shares of series b preferred stock  respectively  available under the sales agreement 
on october   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program which permits us to acquire up to  shares of our common stock 
the shares are expected to be acquired at prevailing prices through open market transactions 
the manner  price  number and timing of share repurchases will be subject to market conditions and applicable sec rules 
during the year ended december   we repurchased an aggregate of  shares at a weighted average price of per share under this program 
our board of directors also authorized the company to purchase an amount of our common stock up to the amount of common stock sold under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
disclosure of contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years repurchase agreements junior subordinated notes lease commitment total these represent amounts due by maturity 
these represent amounts due by contractual maturity 
however  we do have the option to redeem these after march  and april  as more fully described in note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our agency mbs and non agency mbs  which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value rather than historical cost 
based upon these treatments  our total equity base at december  was billion 
common stockholders equity was approximately billion  or a book value of per share 
under our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in fair values of assets are assessed to determine whether they are other than temporary 
to the extent we determine that these unrealized fluctuations are not other than temporary  they do not impact gaap income or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the assets and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting on all of our assets 
as a result  comparisons with some companies that use historical cost accounting for all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 

table of contents unrealized changes in the fair value of mbs have one significant and direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity  while negative changes will tend to reduce borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mbs might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain on available for sale agency mbs was approximately million  or of the amortized cost of our agency mbs  at december  this  along with accumulated other comprehensive loss  derivatives of approximately million and accumulated other comprehensive gain  non agency mbs of thousand  constitutes the total accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
management has reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying audited financial statements 
in preparing these audited financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments on the basis of information then readily available to it of certain amounts included in the audited financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially and adversely from these estimates 
our accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
management believes the more significant of our accounting policies are the following revenue recognition the most significant source of our revenue is derived from our investments in mbs 
we reflect income using the effective yield method which  through amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts at an effective yield  recognizes periodic income over the estimated life of the investment on a constant yield basis  as adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
management believes our revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
interest income on our mbs is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal amounts of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the expected lives of the securities using the effective interest yield method  adjusted for the effects of actual prepayments and estimated prepayments based on asc our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is materially incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income  which could be material and adverse 
valuation and classification of investment securities we carry our investment securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our agency mbs are generally based on third party bid price indications provided by certain dealers who make markets in such securities 
the fair value of our non agency mbs are obtained from an independent third party pricing service whose methodologies are based on broker provided pricing as well as indirect observation of market activity 
if  in the opinion of management  one or more securities prices reported to us are not reliable or unavailable  management reviews the fair value based on characteristics of the security it receives from the issuer and 
table of contents available market information 
the fair values reported reflect estimates and may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
we review various factors ie  expected cash flows  changes in interest rates  credit protection  etc 
in determining whether and to what extent an other than temporary impairment exists 
to the extent that unrealized losses on our agency mbs and non agency mbs are attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because we do not have the intent to sell these investments nor is it not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be at maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired 
losses that are related to credit quality on securities classified as available for sale  which are determined by management to be other than temporary in nature  are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to current period income loss

accounting for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with asc  a derivative that is designated as a hedge is recognized as an asset liability and measured at estimated fair value 
in order for our interest rate swap agreements to qualify for hedge accounting  upon entering into the swap agreement  we must anticipate that the hedge will be highly effective  as defined by asc on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that are highly effective and that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to income when the forecasted transaction affects income eg  when periodic settlement interest payments are due on repurchase agreements 
the swap agreements are carried on our balance sheets at their fair value based on values obtained from large financial institutions  who are market makers for these types of instruments 
hedge ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in current period income 
we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
if it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
when we discontinue hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is reclassified into income when the forecasted transaction affects income 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding  we will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet  recognizing changes in the fair value in current period income 
for purposes of the cash flow statement  cash flows from derivative instruments are classified with the cash flows from the hedged item

income taxes our financial results do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to be taxed as a reit and  as a result  management does not expect to pay substantial  if any  corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial instruments in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity for stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through ownership of our common stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk we primarily invest in adjustable rate  hybrid and fixed rate mortgage related assets 
hybrid mortgages are arms that have a fixed interest rate for an initial period of time typically three years or greater and then convert to an adjustable rate for the remaining loan term 
our debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates 
arm related assets are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount an arm related asset s interest rate can change during any given period 
arm securities are also typically subject to a minimum interest rate payable 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
hence  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mortgage related assets could be limited 
this problem would be magnified to the extent we acquire mortgage related assets that are not fully indexed 
further  some arm related assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our liquidity  net income and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we fund the purchase of a substantial portion of our arm related assets with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net interest income  dividend yield and the market price of our common stock 
most of our adjustable rate assets are based on the one year constant maturity treasury rate and the one year libor rate and our debt obligations are generally based on libor 
these indices generally move in the same direction  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
our arm related assets and borrowings reset at various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of our debt obligations occurs more quickly than on our assets 
therefore  on average  our cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does our earnings rate on the assets 
further  our net income may vary somewhat as the spread between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies

we assume that if the repricing of the investment is just beyond months but less than months  it is included in the months or less category 
at december   our agency mbs and non agency mbs and related borrowings will prospectively reprice based on the following time frames dollar amounts in thousands investments borrowings amount percentage of total investments amount percentage of total borrowings investment type rate reset dates year fixed rate investments year fixed rate investments adjustable rate investments obligations months or less greater than months and less than year greater than year and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years total based on when they contractually reprice and do not consider the effect of any prepayments 
we assume that if the repricing of the investment is just beyond months but less than months  it is included in the months or less category 
market value risk all of our mbs are classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie  market value with the periodic adjustment to fair value that is not considered to be an other than temporary impairment reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the equity section of our balance sheet 
the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 

table of contents liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mbs with short term debt 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mbs 
for example  at december   our agency mbs and non agency adjustable rate mbs had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions  the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from mbs 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss during these periods 
our assets that are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality liquid assets 
as a result  we have been able to roll over our short term borrowings as they mature 
there can be no assurance that we will always be able to roll over our short term debt 
during the past few years  there have been continuing liquidity and credit concerns surrounding the mortgage markets and the general global economy 
while the us government and other foreign governments have taken various actions to address these concerns  there are also concerns about the ability of the us government to meet the obligations of the budget control act of and to reduce its budget deficit and about possible future rating downgrades of us sovereign debt and government sponsored agency debt 
on june   moody s investor service  one of the primary rating agencies  downgraded the credit ratings of of the largest global banks from one to three grades 
this could have the effect of reducing the availability of financing in general or lead to changes in credit terms such as collateral requirements or length of financing 
as a result  there continue to be concerns about the potential impact on product availability  liquidity  interest rates and changes in the yield curve 
while we have been able to meet all of our liquidity needs to date  there are still concerns in the mortgage sector about the availability of financing generally 
at december   we had unrestricted cash of million and million in unpledged agency mbs and non agency mbs available to meet margin calls on short term borrowings that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender collateralization requirements 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates on mortgage related securities and mortgage loans vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of arm loans usually can be expected to increase when mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on such loans and decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such loans  although such effects are not entirely predictable 
prepayment rates may also be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate loans and arm loans underlying mbs 
the purchase prices of mbs are generally based upon assumptions regarding the expected amounts and rates of prepayments 
where slow prepayment assumptions are made  we may pay a premium for mbs 
to the extent such assumptions differ from the actual amounts of prepayments  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
the total prepayment of any mbs purchased at a premium by us would result in the immediate write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
in addition  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mbs to replace the prepaid mbs  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be harmed 
we often purchase mortgage related assets that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we must pay a premium over par value to acquire these assets 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mbs 
as we receive repayments of mortgage principal  we amortize the premium balances as a reduction to our income 
if the mortgage loans underlying mbs were prepaid at a faster rate than we anticipate  we would amortize the premium at a faster rate 
this would reduce our income 

table of contents general many assumptions are made to present the information in the tables below and  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur  or that other events that could affect the outcomes will not occur  therefore  the tables below and all related disclosures constitute forward looking statements 
the analyses presented utilize assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change the interest rate risk profile for us 
the tables quantify the potential changes in net income and portfolio value should interest rates immediately change are shocked and remain at the new level for the next twelve months 
the results of interest rate shocks of plus and minus and basis points are presented 
the cash flows from our portfolio of mortgage related assets for each rate shock scenario are projected  based on a variety of assumptions including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates no negative rates are utilized  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include projected changes in us treasury interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of mortgage related assets relative to prevailing us treasury interest rates 
tabular presentation the information presented in the table below projects the impact of instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates on anworth s annual projected net income relative to the unchanged interest rate scenario  and the impact of the same instantaneous parallel shifts on anworth s projected portfolio value the value of our assets  including the value of any derivative instruments or hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements 
these projections are based on investments in place at december   and include all of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value the information presented in the table below projects the impact of the same sudden changes in interest rates on anworth s annual projected net income and projected portfolio value compared to the base case used in the table above  and the only difference is that it excludes the effect of the interest rate swap agreements on both net interest income and portfolio value 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was billion and the weighted average maturity was years 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value
