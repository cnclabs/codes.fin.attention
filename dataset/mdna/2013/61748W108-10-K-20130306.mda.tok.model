item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected historical financial and operating data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a fully integrated lifestyle hospitality company that operates  owns  acquires  develops and redevelops boutique hotels  primarily in gateway cities and select resort markets in the united states  europe and other international locations  and nightclubs  restaurants  bars and other food and beverage venues in many of the hotels we operate  as well as in hotels and casinos operated by mgm in las vegas 
since  when we opened our first hotel  we have gained experience operating in a variety of market conditions 
the historical financial data presented herein is the historical financial data for our three owned hotels  consisting  as of december   of hudson in new york  delano south beach in miami beach  and clift in san francisco which we lease under a long term lease that is treated as a financing  comprising approximately  rooms  our owned f b operations  consisting  as of december   of the food and beverage operations located at our owned hotels  certain food and beverage operations located at sanderson and st martins lane  both in london  and three restaurants at mandalay bay in las vegas for which we acquired the leasehold interests in august  our four joint venture hotels  consisting  as of december   of mondrian south beach in miami beach  shore club in miami beach  ames in boston and mondrian soho in new york  comprising approximately  rooms  our seven managed hotels  consisting  as of december   of royalton and morgans in new york  mondrian in los angeles  sanderson and st martins lane in london  delano marrakech in morocco  and hotel las palapas in playa del carmen  mexico  comprising approximately  rooms  our controlling interest in tlg  a leading lifestyle food and beverage management company with a ten year track record of delivering cutting edge food and beverage experiences at world class properties 
tlg develops  redevelops and operates numerous venues primarily in las vegas pursuant to management agreements with mgm  including nightclubs  restaurants  pool lounges and bars  our investment in our f b venture  consisting  as of december   of certain food and beverage operations located at mondrian south beach in miami beach  and our investments in hotels under development and other proposed properties 
at december   we had four joint venture hotels and seven managed hotels  all of which we manage pursuant to long term management agreements 
our hotel management agreements may be subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
for example  certain of our hotel management agreements contain performance tests that stipulate certain minimum levels of operating performance 
in addition  several of our hotels are also subject to mortgage and mezzanine debt  and in some instances our management fee is subordinated to the debt 
with all of our new management agreements for hotels under development  we attempt to negotiate non disturbance agreements or similar protections with the mortgage lender  or to require that such agreements be entered into upon securing of financing  in order to protect our management agreements in the event of foreclosure 
however  we are not always successful in imposing these requirements and some of our new development projects and existing hotels do not have non disturbance or similar protections  which may make the related management agreements subject to termination by the lenders on foreclosure or certain other related events 
even if we have such non disturbance protections in place  they may be subject to conditions and may be difficult or costly to enforce in a foreclosure situation 
we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and the f b venture 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net losses and distributions 
tlg s management agreements may be subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
for example  all of the management agreements contain  among other covenants  a performance test that stipulates a minimum level of operating performance  and restrictions as to certain requirements of suitability  capacity  compliance with laws and material terms  financial stability  and that certain named representatives must remain employed by or under contract to tlg 

table of contents several of our hotels are also subject to mortgage and mezzanine debt  and in some instances our management fee is subordinated to the debt  and our management agreements may be terminated by the lenders on foreclosure or certain other related events 
for example  the mortgage debt secured by ames matured in october and the mortgage lender has served the joint venture with a notice of event of default stating that the million nonrecourse mortgage refinancing on the property was not repaid when it matured 
the joint venture is pursuing discussions with the lenders  which include discussions regarding amending the termination rights under our management agreement 
additionally  the mortgage debt secured by mondrian soho matured in november  and in january  the lender initiated foreclosure proceedings seeking  among other things  the ability to sell the property free and clear of our management agreement 
in february  the owner of mondrian soho  a joint venture in which morgans group owns a equity interest  gave notice purporting to terminate our subsidiary as manager of the hotel 
it also filed a lawsuit against us seeking termination of the management agreement 
we intend to vigorously defend our rights to continue managing the property under our management agreement and our joint venture agreement  but we cannot assure you that we will be successful 
in march  the lender for the shore club mortgage initiated foreclosure proceedings against the property in us federal district court 
in october  the federal court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction 
in november  the lender initiated foreclosure proceedings in state court and a bench trial took place in june during which the trial court granted a default ruling of foreclosure 
entry of a foreclosure judgment has been delayed pending  among other things  resolution of a motion to disqualify the presiding trial court judge and corresponding relinquishment of jurisdiction from the florida appeals court to the trial court 
we have operated and expect to continue to operate the hotel pursuant to the management agreement during the pendency of these proceedings  which may continue for some additional period of time in the event of an appeal or other post judgment proceedings 
however  there can be no assurances as to whether or when a foreclosure sale may take place  or whether we will continue to operate the hotel in the event there is a foreclosure 
factors affecting our results of operations revenues 
changes in our hotel revenues are most easily explained by three performance indicators that are commonly used in the hospitality industry occupancy  average daily room rate adr  and revenue per available rooms revpar  which is the product of adr and average daily occupancy  but does not include food and beverage revenue  other hotel operating revenue such as telephone  parking and other guest services  or management fee revenue 
our revenues are derived from the operation of hotels  as well as the operation of nightclub  restaurant and bar venues 
specifically  our revenue consists of rooms revenue 
occupancy and adr are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
food and beverage revenue 
most of our food and beverage revenue is driven by occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our bars and restaurants with our local customers 
in june  we acquired from affiliates of cgm the interests cgm owned in our prior food and beverage joint ventures at delano south beach  mondrian south beach  mondrian los angeles  morgans  sanderson and st martins lane the cgm transaction 
as a result of the cgm transaction  we began recording of the food and beverage revenue and related expenses at these hotels  with the exception of mondrian south beach which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in august  we sold our ownership interest in mondrian los angeles food and beverage operations to the hotel owner 
effective february   we transferred our ownership interest in morgans food and beverage operations to the hotel owner by terminating our operating lease for the restaurant space 
additionally  we record or will record revenue and related expenses at the three restaurants at mandalay bay in las vegas for which we acquired the leasehold interest in august as of december   only one of these restaurants was open 
other hotel revenue 
other hotel revenue  which consists of ancillary revenue such as telephone  parking  spa  entertainment and other guest services  is principally driven by hotel occupancy 

table of contents management fee revenue and other income 
we earn hotel management fees under our hotel management agreements 
these fees may include management fees as well as reimbursement for allocated chain services 
additionally  we own a controlling investment in tlg  which operates numerous venues in las vegas pursuant to management agreements with various mgm affiliates 
each of tlg s venues is managed by an affiliate of tlg  which receives fees under a management agreement for the venue 
through our ownership of tlg  we recognize management fees in accordance with the applicable management agreement  which generally provide for base management fees as a percentage of gross sales  and incentive management fees as a percentage of net profits  as calculated pursuant to the management agreements 
fluctuations in revenues  which tend to correlate with changes in gross domestic product  are driven largely by general economic and local market conditions but can also be impacted by major events  such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters  which in turn affect levels of business and leisure travel 
renovations at our hotels can have a significant impact on our revenues 
for example  our guestroom and corridor renovations at hudson  which began in the fourth quarter of and were completed in late  has had a material impact on our operating results during the year ended december  the seasonal nature of the hospitality business can also impact revenues 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
however  given the recent global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and was not as significant as in prior periods and may remain less pronounced in depending on the timing and strength of the economic recovery 
in addition to economic conditions  supply is another important factor that can affect revenues 
room rates  occupancy and food and beverage revenues tend to fall when supply increases  unless the supply growth is offset by an equal or greater increase in demand 
one reason why we focus on boutique hotels in key gateway cities is because these markets have significant barriers to entry for new competitive supply  including scarcity of available land for new development and extensive regulatory requirements resulting in a longer development lead time and additional expense for new competitors 
finally  competition within the hospitality industry  which includes our hotels and our restaurants  nightclubs  bars and other food and beverage venues  can affect revenues 
competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition  quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property or venue  pricing  and range and quality of nightlife  food and beverage services and amenities offered 
in addition  all of our hotels  restaurants  nightclubs and bars are located in areas where there are numerous competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates and pricing or more convenient locations  services or amenities or significantly expand  improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels  restaurants  nightclubs  bars  and other food and beverage venues compete  thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we would lose market share  which could adversely affect our revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel and food and beverage services  costs to operate our hotel and food and beverage management companies  and costs associated with the ownership of our assets  including rooms expense 
rooms expense includes the payroll and benefits for the front office  housekeeping  concierge and reservations departments and related expenses  such as laundry  rooms supplies  travel agent commissions and reservation expense 
like rooms revenue  occupancy is a major driver of rooms expense  which has a significant correlation with rooms revenue 
food and beverage expense 
similar to food and beverage revenue  occupancy of the hotels in which we operate food and beverage venues  and the popularity of our restaurants  nightclubs  bars and other food and beverage venues  are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental expense 
occupancy is the major driver of other departmental expense  which includes telephone and other expenses related to the generation of other hotel revenue 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense consist of administrative and general expenses  such as payroll and related costs  travel expenses and office rent  advertising and promotion expenses  comprising the payroll of the hotel sales teams  the global sales team and advertising  marketing and promotion expenses for our hotel properties  utility expense and repairs and maintenance expenses  comprising the ongoing costs to repair and maintain our hotel properties 
property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other consist primarily of insurance costs and property taxes 
corporate expenses  including stock compensation 
corporate expenses consist of the cost of our corporate offices  including the corporate office of our owned subsidiary  tlg  net of any cost recoveries  which consists primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expenses  office rent and legal and professional fees and costs associated with being a public company 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense 
hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
we also record amortization expense related to our other assets  such as the tlg management contracts and the three restaurant leases in las vegas that we purchased in august restructuring and disposal costs include costs incurred related to our corporate restructuring initiatives  such as professional fees  litigation and settlement costs  executive terminations and severance costs related to such restructuring initiatives  and losses on asset disposals as part of major renovation projects 
development costs include development transaction costs  internal development payroll  costs and pre opening expenses incurred related to new concepts at existing hotel and the development of new hotels  and the write off of abandoned development projects previously capitalized 
other items interest expense  net 
interest expense  net includes interest on our debt and amortization of financing costs and is presented net of interest income and interest capitalized 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures constitutes our share of the net profits and losses of our joint venture hotels  our f b venture and our investments in hotels under development 
further  we and our joint venture partners review our joint venture hotels and f b venture for other than temporary declines in market value 
in this analysis of fair value  we use discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of our investment taking into account expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
gain on asset sales 
we recorded deferred gains related to the sales of royalton  morgans  mondrian los angeles  and our ownership interests in sanderson and st martins lane  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
as we have significant continuing involvement with these hotels through long term management agreements  the gains on sales are deferred and recognized over the initial term of the related management agreement 
other non operating expenses include costs associated with discontinued operations and previously owned hotels  both consolidated and unconsolidated  transaction costs related to business acquisitions  changes in the fair value of debt and equity instruments  miscellaneous litigation and settlement costs and other expenses that relate to our financing and investing activities 
income tax expense benefit 
all of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to local jurisdiction corporate income taxes 
income tax expense is reported at the applicable rate for the periods presented 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes 
income taxes for the years ended december   and were computed using our calculated effective tax rate 
we also recorded net deferred taxes related to cumulative differences in the basis recorded for certain assets and liabilities 
we established a reserve on the deferred tax assets based on the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards 
noncontrolling interest income loss 
noncontrolling interest is the income loss attributable to the holders of membership units in morgans group  our operating company  owned by residual hotel interest llc  our former parent  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  our third party food and beverage joint venture partner s interest in the profits and losses of our f b venture  and the ownership interest in tlg that is held by certain prior owners of tlg 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
in january  we recognized income from the transfer of the property across the street from delano south beach 
as such  we have recorded the income or loss related to this transfer in income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
preferred stock dividends and accretion 
dividends attributable to our outstanding preferred stock and the accretion of the fair value discount on the issuance of the preferred stock are reflected as adjustments to our net loss to arrive at net loss attributable to common stockholders  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents most categories of variable operating expenses  such as operating supplies  and certain labor  such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses 
increases in revpar attributable to improvements in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  primarily credit card and travel agent commissions 
thus  improvements in adr have a more significant impact on improving our operating margins than occupancy 
notwithstanding our efforts to reduce variable costs  there are limits to how much we can accomplish because we have significant costs that are relatively fixed costs  such as depreciation and amortization  labor costs and employee benefits  insurance  real estate taxes  interest and other expenses associated with owning hotels that do not necessarily decrease when circumstances such as market factors cause a reduction in our hotel revenues 
recent trends and developments recent trends 
lodging demand and revenues are primarily driven by growth in gdp  business investment and employment growth  which were depressed during an extremely difficult recessionary period in late and beginning in  the outlook for the us and global economies began improving and that improvement has continued through however  as a result of the current european economic crisis and slow domestic growth  the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain 
to date  the economic recovery has not been particularly robust  as spending by businesses and consumers remains restrained  and there are still several trends which make our performance difficult to forecast  including shorter booking lead times at our hotels 
the pace of new lodging supply has increased over the past several years as many projects initiated before the economic downturn came to fruition 
for example  we witnessed new competitive luxury and boutique properties opening between and in some of our markets  particularly in new york  miami  and london which have impacted our performance in these markets and may continue to do so 
however  we believe the timing of additional new development projects may be affected by ongoing uncertain economic conditions  which may slow down the pace of new supply development  including our own  in the next few years 
our operating results for the fourth quarter of were strong as we continue to focus on market share and margin improvement 
revpar at our system wide comparable hotels  which excludes delano south beach  hudson  mondrian soho and hotel las palapas  increased by in constant dollars in the fourth quarter of from the comparable period in revpar from our northeast comparable hotels  which consist of morgans  royalton and ames  increased by in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in each hotel in the region was affected differently by hurricane sandy  but overall  business was strong particularly in december with revpar increases of or greater during that month at our comparable new york city hotels  morgans and royalton 
for non comparable hotels  mondrian soho continues to ramp up with revpar increasing by in the fourth quarter of from the comparable period in  despite being closed for one week due to hurricane sandy 
at hudson  with all guest rooms renovated  the hotel generated a revpar increase during the fourth quarter of  despite its restaurant being closed 
revpar from our miami comparable hotels  which consist of mondrian south beach and shore club  increased in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in  driven by a increase in occupancy 
delano south beach  which is a non comparable hotel in  generated a increase in revpar driven by a very strong december and holiday season 
our two west coast hotels generated an revpar growth in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in  led by mondrian los angeles 
in london  revpar increased by  or in constant dollars  during the fourth quarter of  despite the difficult economic climate in europe 
for  we believe that if various economic forecasts projecting continued modest expansion are accurate  this may lead to a gradual and modest increase in lodging demand for both leisure and business travel  although we expect there to be continued pressure on rates  as leisure and business travelers alike continue to focus on cost containment 
as such  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will occur  or be sustained  or that any losses will not increase for these or any other reasons 
recent developments 
in addition to the recent trends described above  we expect that a number of recent events will cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical performance

food and beverage revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the impact of the sale in may of three hotels we previously owned and the corresponding loss of food and beverage revenue from certain of the food and beverage venues at those hotels  as well as the closure of the restaurant and primary bar at hudson in july for a re concepting and renovation 
the new restaurant at hudson  hudson commons  opened in february additionally  the decrease in food and beverage revenue was due to the transfer of ownership of the restaurant at mondrian los angeles and morgans to the respective hotel owners in august and february  respectively

as of december   total restricted cash held pursuant to certain debt or lease requirements was million 
we intend to utilize our liquidity to repay outstanding debt and to fund growth and development efforts  renovations from time to time at existing owned hotels and owned f b operations  infrastructure improvements  and for general corporate purposes 
we have both short term and long term liquidity requirements as described in more detail below 
liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our short term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred by us or our consolidated subsidiaries within the next months and believe those requirements currently consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties  including the funding of our reserve accounts  capital commitments associated with certain of our development projects and existing hotels  and the completion of our sro guestroom conversions and food and beverage renovations at hudson 
we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt or lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach 
our joint venture hotels and our managed hotels generally are subject to similar obligations under our management agreements or under debt agreements related to such hotels 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
such agreements typically require us to reserve funds at amounts equal to of the hotel s revenues and require the funds to be set aside in restricted cash 
included in restricted cash as of december  was million for the completion of the hudson sro units and million for the completion of hudson commons  the new restaurant at hudson  all of which was released to us in february we are focused on growing our portfolio  primarily with our core brands  in major gateway markets and key resort destinations 
in order to obtain long term management contracts  we have committed to contribute capital in various forms on hotel development projects 
these include equity investments  key money and cash flow guarantees to hotel owners 
the cash flow guarantees generally have a stated maximum amount of funding and a defined term 
the terms of the cash flow guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit 
often  cash flow guarantees to hotel owners may be recoverable as loans repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and or proceeds from the sale of hotels 
at hudson  we spent most of renovating all the guest rooms and converting sro units into new guest rooms 
the renovation was completed in september we also converted sro units into guest rooms 
sro units were converted in and were converted in january  at an estimated cost of approximately  per room  bringing the total number of guest rooms at hudson to as of january  in november  we launched hudson lodge  a winter pop up venue at the hotel s private park 
additionally  in february  we opened a new restaurant at hudson  hudson commons  which is a modern day beer hall and burger joint featuring a wide selection of local craft beers  inventive preparations of classic american fare  and soda shop inspired specialty cocktails 
through december   we have spent approximately million on room  corridor and restaurant renovations and anticipate spending an additional approximately million to complete these projects at hudson in the hudson mortgage loan  discussed further below in debt  matures on february  we have one  one year extension option that will permit us to extend the maturity date of the hudson mortgage loan to february   if certain conditions are satisfied at the extension date 
the extension option requires  among other things  the borrowers to deliver a business plan and budget for the extension term reasonably satisfactory to the lender  maintain a loan to value ratio prior to the initial maturity date of not greater than  and the payment of an extension fee in an amount equal to of the then outstanding principal amount under the hudson mortgage loan 
we may prepay the loan in an amount necessary to achieve the loan to value ratio 
in addition to reserve funds for capital expenditures  our owned hotels debt and lease agreements also require us to deposit cash into escrow accounts for taxes  insurance and debt service or lease payments 

table of contents long term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our long term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred by us or our consolidated subsidiaries beyond the next months and believe these requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay scheduled debt maturities  renovations at our owned hotel and owned f b operations and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically with respect to our properties  the costs associated with acquisitions and development of properties under contract  and new acquisitions and development projects that we may pursue 
our convertible notes  with a face value of million  mature on october  unless repurchased by us or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
the yucaipa investors own million of the convertible notes 
our series a preferred securities  discussed further below in debt  have an dividend rate until october   a dividend rate from october  to october   and a dividend rate thereafter 
the cumulative unpaid dividends also have a dividend rate equal to the then applicable dividend rate on the series a preferred securities 
we have the option to accrue any and all dividend payments  and as of december   have not declared any dividends 
as of december   we have undeclared dividends of approximately million 
we have the option to redeem any or all of the series a preferred securities at any time 
other long term liquidity requirements include our obligations under our delano credit facility  which expires in july  our tlg promissory notes  which mature in november  our trust preferred securities  which mature in october  and the clift lease  each as described under debt 
additionally  as part of our acquisition of tlg  each of messrs 
sasson and masi received the right to require morgans group to purchase his equity interest in tlg at any time after november  at a purchase price equal to his percentage equity ownership interest multiplied by the product of seven times the non morgans ebitda  as defined below in debt  for the preceding months  subject to certain adjustments the sasson masi put options 
the aggregate purchase price for the sasson masi put options  which become exercisable in december  would have been an estimated million based on the contractual formula applied as of december  we anticipate we will need to renovate clift in the next few years  which will require additional capital that we expect to fund from the sources described below 
additionally  as our new managed hotels are developed  to the extent we have committed to contribute key money  equity or debt  these amounts will generally come due prior to the hotel opening 
as of december   our long term key money commitments were approximately million and our potential funding under cash flow guarantees at operating hotels and hotels under development at the maximum amount under the applicable contracts  but excluding contracts where the maximum cannot be determined  was million 
as of december   we did not have any equity or debt financing commitments 
in december  we agreed to allow the owners of hudson london to extend their option period for converting an approximately million cash flow guarantee  which would become effective once the hotel is opened  into a key money obligation of approximately million 
in the event the owners exercise such conversion option  the key money obligation could become due as early as once the owners finalize the capital plan 
financing for some of our development projects has not yet been identified 
given the uncertain economic environment and continuing challenging conditions in the credit markets  these and other projects may not be able to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all 
if adequate project financing is not obtained  these projects may need to be limited in scope  deferred or cancelled altogether  and to the extent we have previously funded key money  equity or debt on a cancelled project  we may be unable to recover the amounts funded 
sources of liquidity 
historically  we have satisfied our short term and long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  equity and debt offerings  long term mortgages and mezzanine loans on our properties  and more recently  cash generated through asset dispositions 
in the future  we may require additional debt or equity financings to satisfy both our short term and long term liquidity requirements or may need to access other sources 
these sources may include joint venture transactions and new financing opportunities  which may involve the restructuring of our outstanding debt or preferred securities  the disposition of assets and businesses  and the repurchase from time to time of our outstanding debt securities in open market transactions or otherwise 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately million of remaining federal tax net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income  including gains on future asset sales 
we have begun a sales process for delano south beach and intend to use the proceeds from any sale for debt reduction  growth and general working capital purposes 
in addition  we believe we have significant value available to us in hudson  as we consider upcoming maturities of debt starting in although the credit and equity markets remain challenging  we believe that these sources of capital will become available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to access any of these sources on terms acceptable to us or at all 
for example  our ability to obtain additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders and general market conditions 
we will continue to explore various options from time to time as necessary for our liquidity requirements or advantageous in pursuing our business strategy 
other liquidity matters in addition to our expected short term and long term liquidity requirements  our liquidity could also be affected by certain other potential liquidity matters  including at our joint venture hotels  as discussed below

seasonality the hospitality business is seasonal in nature 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
quarterly revenues also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as the recent global recession  extreme weather conditions  terrorist attacks or alerts  natural disasters  airline strikes  and other considerations affecting travel 
to help demonstrate seasonality  the table below provides room revenues by quarter for the years ended december  and for hudson and delano south beach  both of which are included in our owned hotels as of december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in millions hudson room revenues first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in millions delano south beach room revenues given the guestroom and corridor renovations at hudson  which began in the fourth quarter of and were completed in late  the impact of seasonality in and was not as significant as in prior periods 
further  due to the recent global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and was not as significant as in pre recessionary periods and may continue to be less pronounced in depending on the timing and strength of the economic recovery 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may have to enter into additional short term borrowings or increase our borrowings  if available under our delano credit facility  to meet cash requirements 
capital expenditures and reserve funds we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt or lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach 
our joint venture hotels and our managed hotels generally are subject to similar obligations under our management agreements or under debt agreements related to such hotels 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
such agreements typically require the hotel owners to reserve funds at amounts equal to of the hotel s revenues and require the funds to be set aside in restricted cash 
as of december   approximately million was available in restricted cash reserves for future capital expenditures under these obligations related to our owned hotels 

table of contents on march   we completed a million renovation at delano south beach which began in the third quarter of the renovations included the re opening of a newly concepted restaurant  bianca  improved public areas  such as the rose bar and pool and beach bars  a new nightclub  fdr  upgraded exclusive bungalows and suites  and  square feet of additional meeting space

we anticipate we will need to renovate clift in the next few years  which will require capital and will most likely be funded by equity contributions  debt financing  possible asset sales  future operating cash flows or a combination of these sources 
the hudson mortgage loan provides that  in the event the debt yield ratio falls below certain defined thresholds  all cash from the property is deposited into accounts controlled by the lenders from which debt service and operating expenses  including management fees  are paid and from which other reserve accounts may be funded 
any excess amounts are retained by the lenders until the debt yield ratio exceeds the required thresholds for three consecutive months 
furthermore  if our management company subsidiary that manages hudson is not reserving sufficient funds for property tax  ground rent  insurance premiums  and capital expenditures in accordance with the hotel management agreement  then our subsidiary borrowers would be required to fund the reserve account for such purposes 
our subsidiary borrowers are not permitted to have any indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness customary in such transactions  including ordinary trade payables  purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations  subject to limits 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the interest rate risks related to our variable rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments using models which incorporate standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow and option pricing models to determine fair value 
we believe these methods of estimating fair value result in general approximation of value  and such value may or may not be realized 
as of december   we had two interest rate caps outstanding and the fair values of these interest rate caps were insignificant 
in connection with the sale of the convertible notes  we entered into call options which are exercisable solely in connection with any conversion of the convertible notes and pursuant to which we will receive shares of our common stock from counterparties equal to the number of shares of our common stock  or other property  deliverable by us to the holders of the convertible notes upon conversion of the convertible notes  in excess of an amount of shares or other property with a value  at then current prices  equal to the principal amount of the converted convertible notes 
simultaneously  we also entered into warrant transactions  whereby we sold warrants to purchase in the aggregate  shares of our common stock  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  at an exercise price of approximately per share of common stock 
these convertible notes warrants may be exercised over a day trading period commencing january  the call options and the convertible notes warrants are separate contracts and are not part of the terms of the convertible notes and will not affect the holders rights under the convertible notes 
the call options are intended to offset potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of the common stock at the time of exercise is greater than the exercise price of the call options  which is equal to the initial conversion price of the convertible notes and is subject to certain customary adjustments 
on october   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with yucaipa american alliance fund ii  lp and yucaipa american alliance parallel fund ii  lp  which we refer to collectively as the yucaipa investors

the yucaipa warrants have a year term and are exercisable utilizing a cashless exercise method only  resulting in a net share issuance 
the exercise price and number of shares subject to the warrant are both subject to anti dilution adjustments

among other things  the amendment allowed the joint venture to accrue all interest through april  allows the joint venture to accrue a portion of the interest thereafter and provides the joint venture the ability to provide seller financing to qualified condominium buyers with up to of the condominium purchase price 
the amendment also provides that the million mezzanine financing invested in the property by the mezzanine financing joint venture be elevated in the capital structure to become  in effect  on par with the lender s mezzanine debt so that the mezzanine financing joint venture receives at least of all returns in excess of the first mortgage 
the mondrian south beach joint venture was determined to be a variable interest entity as during the process of refinancing the venture s mortgage in april  its equity investment at risk was considered insufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities 
we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity as we do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity 
because we have written our investment value in the joint venture to zero  for financial reporting purposes  we believe our maximum exposure to losses as a result of our involvement in the mondrian south beach variable interest entity is limited to our outstanding management fees and related receivables and advances in the form of mezzanine financing  excluding guarantees and other contractual commitments 
we have not committed to providing financial support to this variable interest entity  other than as contractually required  and all future funding is expected to be provided by the joint venture partners in accordance with their respective ownership interests in the form of capital contributions or loans  or by third parties

in october  the joint venture partners funded their pro rata shares of the debt service reserve account  of which our contribution was million  in order to complete an extension of the outstanding mortgage debt of the venture 
we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity as we do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity 
because we have written our investment value in the joint venture to zero  for financial reporting purposes  we believe our maximum exposure to losses as a result of our involvement in the ames variable interest entity is limited to our outstanding management fees and related receivables  excluding guarantees and other contractual commitments

additionally  as a result of cash shortfalls at mondrian soho  we funded an additional million in  which has been treated in part as additional capital contributions and in part as loans from our management company subsidiary 
management subsequently deemed such amounts uncollectible as of december  and recorded an impairment charge through equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
based on the decline in market conditions following the inception of the joint venture and  more recently  the need for additional funding to complete the hotel  we wrote down our investment in mondrian soho to zero in june and recorded an impairment charge of million through equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december  we have recorded all additional fundings as impairment charges through equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures during the periods the funds were contributed 
as of december   our financial statements reflect no value for our investment in the mondrian soho joint venture 
in december  the mondrian soho joint venture was determined to be a variable interest entity as a result of the november debt maturity and cash shortfalls  and because its equity was considered insufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities

for further information regarding our off balance sheet arrangements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for information related to our adoption of new accounting standards in and for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

table of contents we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
when triggering events occur  we periodically review each property for possible impairment 
recoverability of such assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  as determined by applying our operating budgets for future periods 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we estimated each property s fair value using a discounted cash flow method taking into account each property s expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
the factors we address in determining estimated net proceeds from disposition include anticipated operating cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal cash flow capitalization rate and selling price per room 
our judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  the growth rate of the property revenues  and the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
additionally  the classification of these assets as held for sale requires the recording of these assets at our estimate of their fair value less estimated selling costs which can affect the amount of impairment recorded 
as of december  and  management concluded that its long lived assets were not impaired 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets attributable to business acquisitions and combinations 
we test for impairment of goodwill at least annually and at year end 
we will test for impairment more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in accordance with asu no 
 management assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if this is the case  management will perform a more detailed two step goodwill impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized  if any 
in applying the detailed two step process  management identifies potential impairments in goodwill by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  including goodwill  the asset is not impaired 
any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss in continuing operations 
management applies a discounted cash flow method to perform its annual goodwill fair value impairment test taking into account approved operating budgets with appropriate growth assumptions  holding period and proceeds from disposing of the property 
in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis  management also considers external independent appraisals to estimate fair value 
the analysis and appraisals used by management are consistent with those used by a market participant 
judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  growth rate of the property revenues  and the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
the discount rate and the terminal cash flow capitalization rate were based on applicable public hotel studies and market indices 
given the current economic environment  management believes that the growth assumptions applied are reasonable 
we have one reportable operating segment  which is its reporting unit under asc  therefore management aggregates goodwill associated to all owned hotels and owned food and beverage venues when analyzing potential impairment 
as of december  and  management concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as qualitative factors did not indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its fair value 
management does not believe it is reasonably likely that goodwill will become impaired in future periods  but will test goodwill before the year end if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets 
the respective lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions made by us  including the cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish our hotels  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
hotel properties and other completed real estate investments are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and generally five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
while our management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels or other assets 
we have not changed the estimated useful lives of any of our assets during the periods discussed and believe that the future useful lives of our assets will be consistent with historical trends and experience 

table of contents consolidation policy 
variable interest entities are accounted for within the scope of asc and are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could be potentially significant to the variable interest entity 
we evaluate our interests in accordance with asc  consolidation asc to determine if they are variable interests in variable interest entities 
significant judgments and assumptions are made by us to determine whether an entity is a variable interest entity such as those regarding the sufficiency of an entity s equity at risk and whether the entity s equity holders have the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance 
we have evaluated the applicability of asc to our investments in unconsolidated hotel joint ventures and our food and beverage operation at a joint venture hotel  mondrian south beach 
we have determined that most of these joint ventures do not meet the requirements of a variable interest entity and some of the ventures meet the requirements of a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore  consolidation of these ventures is not required 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net loss and distributions 
assets held for sale 
in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment  other presentation matters  we consider properties to be assets held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a property or a group of properties for sale and the sale is probable 
upon designation as an asset held for sale  we record the carrying value of each property or group of properties at the lower of its carrying value  which includes allocable goodwill  or its estimated fair value  less estimated costs to sell  and we stop recording depreciation expense 
any gain realized in connection with the sale of the properties for which we have significant continuing involvement  such as through a long term management agreement  is deferred and recognized over the initial term of the related management agreement 
the operations of the properties held for sale prior to the sale date are recorded in discontinued operations unless we have continuing involvement  such as through a management agreement  after the sale 
business combinations 
in accordance with asc  business combinations  we recognize identifiable assets acquired  liabilities both specific and contingent assumed  and non controlling interests in a business combination at their fair values at the acquisition date based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
furthermore  acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  are expensed as incurred and are not applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
in certain situations  a deferred tax liability is created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired asset at the acquisition date  which also may result in a goodwill asset being recorded 
stock based compensation 
we have adopted the fair value method of accounting prescribed in asc  compensation  stock based compensation asc for equity based compensation awards 
asc requires an estimate of the fair value of the equity award at the time of grant rather than the intrinsic value method 
for all fixed equity based awards to employees and directors  which have no vesting conditions other than time of service  the fair value of the equity award at the grant date will be amortized to compensation expense over the award s vesting period on a straight line basis 
for performance based compensation plans  we recognize compensation expense at such time when the performance hurdle is anticipated to be achieved over the performance period based upon the fair value at the date of grant 
the fair value is determined based on the value of our common stock on the grant date of the award  in the case of stock option awards  the black scholes option pricing model  or in the case of outperformance long term incentive units  or opp ltip units  the monte carlo simulation method 
management s assumptions when applying the black scholes model are derived based upon the risk profile and volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
the monte carlo simulation uses a statistical formula underlying the black scholes and binomial formulas and such simulation is run approximately  times 
for each simulation  the payoff is calculated at the settlement date  which is then discounted to the award date at a risk free interest rate 
the average of the values over all simulations is the expected value of the unit on the award date 
assumptions used in the valuations include factors associated with the underlying performance of our stock price and total shareholder return over the term of the performance awards including total stock return volatility and risk free interest 
we believe that the assumptions that we have applied to stock based compensation are reasonable and we will continue to review such assumptions quarterly and revise them as market conditions change and management deems necessary 

table of contents deferred income taxes and valuation allowance 
we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance will be provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
such valuation allowance will be estimated by management based on our projected future taxable income 
the estimate of future taxable income is highly subjective 
we have a net operating loss for the tax years and and anticipate that all or a major portion of the net operating loss will be utilized to offset any future gains on sale of assets 
however  these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur in the future 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
at december  and  we had a million and valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
some of our outstanding debt has a variable interest rate 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial results of operations derivative financial instruments above  we use derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   our total outstanding consolidated debt  including capital lease obligations  was approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was variable rate debt 
at december   the one month libor rate was 
as of december   the million of variable rate debt consisted of our outstanding balance of million on the hudson mortgage loan and our million of borrowings outstanding under our delano credit facility 
in connection with the hudson mortgage loan  an interest rate cap for in the full amount of million was outstanding as of december  this interest rate cap matures in february the outstanding borrowings of million on our delano credit facility as of december  are not subject to an interest rate hedge 
if interest rates on this million variable rate debt increase by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
the maximum annual amount the interest expense would increase on the million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  under the hudson mortgage loan is million due to our interest rate cap agreement  which would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by the same amount annually 
if interest rates on this million variable rate decrease by  the decrease in interest expense would increase pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately million annually 
as of december   our fixed rate debt  excluding our hudson capital lease obligation  of million consisted of the trust notes underlying our trust preferred securities  the convertible notes  the clift lease  the tlg promissory notes  and the restaurant lease note 
the fair value of some of these debts is greater than the book value 
as such  if interest rates increase by  or approximately basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  or basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  would increase by million 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments and future cash flows 
these analyses do not consider the effect of a reduced level of overall economic activity 
if overall economic activity is significantly reduced  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure 
however  because we cannot determine the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
we have entered into agreements with each of our derivative counterparties in connection with our interest rate caps and hedging instruments related to the convertible notes  providing that in the event we either default or are capable of being declared in default on any of our indebtedness  then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations 
currency exchange risk as we have international operations at hotels that we manage in london  mexico and morocco  currency exchange risks between the us dollar and the british pound  the us dollar and mexican peso  and the us dollar and the moroccan dirham  respectively  arise as a normal part of our business 
we reduce these risks by transacting these businesses primarily in their local currency 
generally  we do not enter into forward or option contracts to manage our exposure applicable to day to day net operating cash flows 
we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future  with the exception of the sale of our interests in our two london hotels  in connection with which we entered into a foreign currency forward contract due to the material nature of the transaction
