these stores opened as shoprites on july  after remodeling 
village is the second largest member of wakefern food corporation wakefern  the nation s largest retailer owned food cooperative and owner of the shoprite name 
this ownership interest in wakefern provides village many of the economies of scale in purchasing  distribution  advanced retail technology  marketing and advertising associated with larger chains 
the company s stores  five of which are owned  average  total square feet 
larger store sizes enable village to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one stop shopping  including pharmacies  natural and organic departments  ethnic and international foods  and home meal replacement 
during fiscal  sales per store were  and sales per square foot of selling space were  management believes these figures are among the highest in the supermarket industry 
the supermarket industry is highly competitive 
the company competes directly with multiple retail formats  including national  regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs  supercenters  drug stores  discount general merchandise stores  fast food chains  restaurants  dollar stores and convenience stores 
village competes by using low pricing  superior customer service  and a broad range of consistently available quality products  including shoprite private labeled products 
the shoprite price plus card also strengthens customer loyalty 
we consider a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance  such as same store sales  percentage of total sales by department mix  shrink  departmental gross profit percentage  sales per labor hour  and hourly labor rates 
during the last few years  the supermarket industry was impacted by changing consumer behavior due to the weak economy and high unemployment 
consumers continue to spend cautiously by trading down to lower priced items  including private label  and concentrating their buying on sale items 
also  the company estimates that product prices overall experienced substantial inflation in the first half of fiscal  with only modest inflation in the second half of fiscal and during fiscal hurricane sandy devastated our area on october   two days after the end of our first fiscal quarter 
the storm increased sales in the last week of our first quarter of fiscal as customers prepared for the storm 
sales in the first week of the second quarter of fiscal were negatively impacted by the closure of almost all of our stores for periods of time ranging from a few hours to eight days 
however  this impact was partially offset by improved sales in stores that reopened quickly and by higher sales in most stores in subsequent weeks as customers restocked after their power was restored 
in addition  village disposed of substantial amounts of perishable product due to the loss of power  and also incurred repair  labor and other costs in connection with the storm 
the company has property  casualty and business interruption insurance  subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
during the second quarter of fiscal  village began the process of working with our insurers to recover the damages and has recorded estimated insurance recoveries 
final resolution of our insurance claim related to the storm is expected in fiscal  which could have a material impact on our results of operations

same store sales increased due to higher sales as customers prepared for hurricane sandy  improved sales at the stores that reopened quickly after that storm and higher sales in the two stores in maryland

sales continue to be impacted by economic weakness  high gas prices and high unemployment  which has resulted in increased sale item penetration and trading down 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased

gross margins declined in several departments primarily due to investments in lower prices to combat nontraditional competitors

and higher patronage dividends 
these improvements were partially offset by higher promotional spending operating and administrative expense operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 
in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to higher payroll 
and fringe benefit 
costs  a charge from settlement of a dispute with a landlord  and the prior fiscal year included a favorable settlement of a pension withdrawal liability 
these increases were partially offset by income from settlement of the national credit card lawsuit 
in the current fiscal year 
payroll costs increased due to efforts to enhance the customer experience and provide additional services  including our first village food garden at the remodeled livingston store and the addition of shoprite from home in several stores 
fringe benefit costs increased due to higher costs for health  pension and workers compensation 
operating and administrative expense as percentage of sales decreased 
in fiscal compared to the prior year due to the prior year including a  charge for the withdrawal liability from a multi employer defined benefit plan

excluding these items from both fiscal years  net income in fiscal declined compared to the prior year primarily due to lower gross profit percentages and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales  partially offset by reduced losses in the two maryland stores compared to the prior year  which was their initial year of operations 
maryland stores sales and operating performance remain lower than expected as we continue to build market share and brand awareness

excluding a  net of tax charge for the withdrawal liability from a multi employer pension plan in the prior year  net income increased

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
impairment the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  such as property  equipment and fixtures for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
such review analyzes the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from asset groups at the store level to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their respective cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  it is measured by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset groups held for use to their carrying value 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the end of each fiscal year  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
the company utilizes valuation techniques  such as earnings multiples  in addition to the company s market capitalization to assess goodwill for impairment 
calculating the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates 
management believes the fair value of village s one reporting unit exceeds its carrying value at july  should the company s carrying value of its one reporting unit exceed its fair value  the amount of any resulting goodwill impairment may be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
patronage dividends as a stockholder of wakefern  village earns a share of wakefern s earnings  which are distributed as a patronage dividend see note 
this dividend is based on a distribution of substantially all of wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year which ends september in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by each member from wakefern during that fiscal year 
patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as merchandise is sold 
village accrues estimated patronage dividends due from wakefern quarterly based on an estimate of the annual wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of village s share of this annual dividend based on village s estimated proportional share of the dollar volume of business transacted with wakefern that year 
the amount of patronage dividends receivable based on these estimates were  and  at july  and july   respectively 
pension plans the determination of the company s obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans is dependent  in part  on village s selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions are described in note and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation costs 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
while management believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect cash flows  pension obligations and future expense 
the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the company s pension obligations could be effectively settled based on the expected timing and amounts of benefits payable to participants under the plans 
our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of july  was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve on high quality fixed income investments 
based on this method  we utilized a weighted average discount rate of at july  compared to at july  the 
increase in the discount rate  and a change in the mortality table utilized  decreased the projected benefit obligation at july  by approximately  village evaluated the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and the expected increase in compensation costs of to and concluded no changes in these assumptions were necessary in estimating pension plan obligations and expense 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of the company s pension plans is as follows percentage point change projected benfit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets village contributed  and  in fiscal and  respectively  to these company sponsored pension plans 
village expects to contribute  in fiscal to these plans 
the  and expected contributions are substantially all voluntary contributions 
the company also contributes to several multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements 
these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded 
share based employee compensation all share based payments to employees are recognized in the financial statements as compensation expense based on the fair market value on the date of grant 
village determines the fair market value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions  such as a risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and expected life of options  in order to arrive at a fair value estimate 
uncertain tax positions the company is subject to periodic audits by various taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
accounting for these uncertain tax positions requires significant management judgment 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal compared to  in the corresponding period of the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the prior year including a settlement of a  pension liability and changes in the timing of payables 
during fiscal village used cash to fund capital expenditures of  and dividends of  capital expenditures include substantial remodels of three stores and the site work and beginning of construction of a replacement store 
dividends paid include  of special dividends 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal compared to  in the corresponding period of the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to settlement of a  pension withdrawal liability in fiscal  a decrease in payables in the current fiscal year as compared to an increase in the prior fiscal year  and the prior year including a refund of cash the company had placed in escrow to fund a property acquisition 
these decreases were partially offset by higher net income in the current fiscal year 
during fiscal  village used cash to fund capital expenditures of  the acquisition of the old bridge shoprite of  and dividends of  capital expenditures include remodeling and equipment for the acquired maryland stores  the installation of solar panels in one store and several small remodels 
liquidity and debt working capital was   and  at july   july  and july   respectively 
working capital ratios at the same dates were   and to one  respectively 
the company s working capital needs are reduced since inventory is generally sold before payments to wakefern and other suppliers are due 
village has budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal planned expenditures include the construction of two replacement stores  one of which began in fiscal the company s primary sources of liquidity in fiscal are expected to be cash and cash equivalents on hand at july  and operating cash flow generated in fiscal at july   the company had a  note receivable due from wakefern earning a fixed rate of 
previously  this month note was automatically extended for additional  recurring day periods  unless  not later than one year prior to the due date  the company notified wakefern requesting payment on the due date 
wakefern has the right to prepay this note at any time and notified the company that they intend to prepay the note on february  village has an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing a maximum amount available for borrowing of  this loan agreement expires on december  the revolving credit line can be used for general corporate purposes 
indebtedness under this agreement bears interest at the prime rate  or at the eurodollar rate  at the company s option  plus applicable margins based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
there were no amounts outstanding at july  or july  under this facility 
the revolving loan agreement contains covenants that  among other conditions  require a maximum liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a positive net income 
at july   the company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the revolving loan agreement 
under the above covenants  village had approximately  of net worth available at july  for the payment of dividends 
during fiscal  village paid cash dividends of  dividends in fiscal consist of per class a common share and per class b common share 
these amounts include  of special dividends paid in december  comprised of per class a common share and per class b common share

contractual obligations and commitments the table below presents significant contractual obligations of the company at july  payments due by fiscal period thereafter total capital and financing leases operating leases notes payable to related party in addition  the company is obligated to purchase of its primary merchandise requirements from wakefern see note 
the above amounts for capital  financing and operating leases include interest  but do not include certain obligations under these leases for other charges 
these charges consisted of the following in fiscal real estate taxes  common area maintenance  insurance  and contingent rentals pension plan funding requirements are excluded from the above table as estimated contribution amounts for future years are uncertain 
required future contributions will be determined by  among other factors  actual investment performance of plan assets  interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations  and changes in legislation 
the company expects to contribute  in fiscal to fund company sponsored defined benefit pension plans compared to actual contributions of  in fiscal the table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans  which totaled  in fiscal the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of  at july  has been excluded from this table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined

we expect same store sales to increase from to in fiscal during the last few years  the supermarket industry was impacted by changing consumer behavior due to the weak economy and high unemployment 
consumers continue to spend cautiously by trading down to lower priced items  including private label  and concentrating their buying on sale items 
management expects these trends to continue in fiscal we expect modest retail price inflation in fiscal we have budgeted  for capital expenditures in fiscal this amount includes the construction of two replacement stores  one of which began in fiscal the board s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends in at the most recent rate of 
per class a and 
per class b share 
we believe cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and debt payments for the foreseeable future 
we expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal to be we expect operating expenses will be affected by increased costs in certain areas  such as medical and pension costs 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from the forward looking statements contained in this report 
these include the supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins 
results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by competitive pricing and promotional programs  industry consolidation and competitor store openings 
village competes with national and regional supermarkets  local supermarkets  warehouse club stores  supercenters  drug stores  convenience stores  dollar stores  discount merchandisers  restaurants and other local retailers 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources  lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do 
the company s stores are concentrated in new jersey  with one store in northeastern pennsylvania and two in maryland 
we are vulnerable to economic downturns in new jersey in addition to those that may affect the country as a whole 
economic conditions such as inflation  deflation  interest rates  energy costs and unemployment rates may adversely affect our sales and profits 
village acquired two stores in july in maryland  a new market for village where the shoprite name is less known than in new jersey 
marketing and other costs are higher than in established markets as village attempts to build market share and brand awareness 
in addition  sales for these two stores are initially expected to be lower than the typical company store 
potentially higher costs and sales results lower than the company s expectations could have a material adverse effect on village s results of operations 
village purchases substantially all of its merchandise from wakefern 
in addition  wakefern provides the company with support services in numerous areas including supplies  advertising  liability and property insurance  technology support and other store services 
further  village receives patronage dividends and other product incentives from wakefern 
any material change in wakefern s method of operation or a termination or material modification of village s relationship with wakefern could have an adverse impact on the conduct of the company s business and could involve additional expense for village 
the failure of any wakefern member to fulfill its obligations to wakefern or a member s insolvency or withdrawal from wakefern could result in increased costs to the company 
additionally  an adverse change in wakefern s results of operations could have an adverse effect on village s results of operations 
approximately of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
contracts with the company s seven unions expire between october and july approximately of our associates are represented by unions whose contracts have already expired or expire within one year 
any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements  we may experience increased operating costs 
village could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food supply chain 
the real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations 
the company is constructing two replacement stores 
at the time the replacement stores are expected to open  we will have rental obligations for several years remaining on the existing stores 
if we are unable to sublease the existing stores on terms similar to the current rent or otherwise mitigate the rental obligations  we may incur charges for these obligations at the time the existing stores are closed 
certain of the multi employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded 
as a result  we expect that contributions to these plans may increase 
additionally  the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements 
under current law  an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan  which represents the portion of the plan s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules 
the failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers 
the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining  actions taken by trustees who manage the plans  government regulations and the actual return on assets held in the plans  among other factors 
our long lived assets  primarily stores  are subject to periodic testing for impairment 
failure of our asset groups to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow could result in impairment charges on long lived assets 
our effective tax rate may be impacted by the results of tax examinations and changes in tax laws  including the disputes with the state of new jersey described in note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements
