item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis reviews significant factors affecting the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
the discussion is organized in the following sections overview acquisition results of operations segment results financial condition and cash flow critical accounting estimates outlook overview graco designs  manufactures and markets systems and equipment to pump  meter  mix and dispense a wide variety of fluids and coatings 
the company specializes in equipment for applications that involve difficult to handle materials with high viscosities  materials with abrasive or corrosive properties and multiple component materials that require precise ratio control 
graco sells primarily through independent third party distributors worldwide to industrial and contractor end users 
more than half of our sales are outside of the united states 
graco s business is classified by management into three reportable segments  each responsible for product development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of their products 
the segments are headquartered in north america 
they have responsibility for operations in the americas and joint responsibility with europe and asia pacific regional management for operations in those geographic areas 
graco s key strategies include developing and marketing new products  leveraging products and technologies into additional  growing end user markets  expanding distribution globally and completing strategic acquisitions that provide additional channel and technologies 
long term financial growth targets accompany these strategies  including our expectation of percent revenue growth and percent consolidated net earnings growth 
manufacturing is a key competency of the company 
our management team in minneapolis provides strategic manufacturing expertise  and is also responsible for factories not fully aligned with a single division 
our primary manufacturing facilities are in the united states and switzerland  and our primary distribution facilities are located in the united states  belgium  switzerland  prc  japan  korea and australia 
acquisition on april   we completed the finishing brands acquisition  including powder finishing operations and liquid finishing operations 
results of the powder finishing business have been included in the industrial segment since the date of acquisition 
pursuant to the hold separate order issued by the ftc  the liquid finishing business is being held separate from the rest of graco s businesses until the ftc has issued its final order and the divestiture of the liquid finishing business is completed 
we have retained the services of an investment bank to help us market the liquid finishing businesses and identify potential buyers 
while we seek a buyer  we must continue to hold the liquid finishing business assets separate from our other businesses and maintain them as viable and competitive 
in accordance with the hold separate order  the liquid finishing businesses are managed independently by experienced liquid finishing business managers  under the supervision of a trustee appointed by the ftc  who reports directly to the ftc 
under terms of the hold separate order  the company does not have the power to direct the activities of the liquid finishing businesses that most significantly impact the economic performance of those businesses 
therefore  we have determined that the liquid finishing businesses are variable interest entities for which the company is not the primary beneficiary and that they should not be consolidated 
furthermore  the company does not have a controlling interest in the liquid finishing businesses  nor is it able to exert significant influence over the liquid finishing businesses 
consequently  our investment in the shares of the liquid finishing businesses has been reflected as a cost method investment on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and their results of operations have not been consolidated with those of the company 
as a cost method investment  income is recognized based on dividends received from current earnings of liquid finishing 
dividends of million received in are included in other expense income on the consolidated statement of earnings for the period ended december  we evaluate our cost method investment for other than temporary impairment at each reporting period 
as of december   we evaluated our investment in liquid finishing and determined that there was no impairment

the company is considering a cash contribution to the funded plan of up to million in critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the company s most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap  requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual amounts will differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents excess and discontinued inventory 
the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for excess and discontinued products are estimated 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
though management considers these balances adequate  changes in sales volumes due to unanticipated economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performs impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for goodwill  the company performs impairment reviews for the company s reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units by an allocation of market capitalization value  cross checked by a present value of future cash flows calculation 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
based on our most recent goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of  the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded carrying value except for the business acquired in the fair value of that business still exceeded its carrying value  and the results related to the analysis for that business are in line with management s expectations given the recent date of appraisal and purchase price allocation 
the company also performs a separate impairment test for each other intangible asset with indefinite life  based on estimated future use and discounting estimated future cash flows 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests 
though management considers its judgments and assumptions to be reasonable  changes in economic or market conditions  product offerings or marketing strategies could change the estimated fair values and result in impairment charges 
product warranty 
a liability is established for estimated warranty claims to be paid in the future that relate to current and prior period sales 
the company estimates these costs based on historical claim experience  changes in warranty programs and other factors  including evaluating specific product warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
liabilities for uncertain tax positions are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal  state and international issues 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that liabilities are properly stated 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory rates  the company s future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits 
retirement obligations 
the measurements of the company s pension and postretirement medical obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions including estimates of the present value of projected future payments  taking into consideration future events such as salary increase and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an impact on the expense and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates for pension obligations include discount rate  inflation  salary increases  retirement rates  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates for postretirement medical obligations include discount rates  rate of future increase in medical costs and participation rates 
for us plans  the company establishes its discount rate assumption by reference to a yield curve published by an actuary and projected plan cash flows 
for plans outside the us  the company establishes a rate by country by reference to highly rated corporate bonds 
these reference points have been determined to adequately match expected plan cash flows 
the company bases its inflation assumption on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary assumptions are based on actual historical experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement rates are based on experience 
the investment return assumption is based on the expected long term performance of plan assets 
in setting this number  the company considers the input of actuaries and investment advisors  its long term historical returns  the allocation of plan assets and projected returns on plan assets 
the company maintained its investment return assumption for its us plan at percent for and set the return assumption for its swiss plan acquired in at percent 
mortality rates are based on a common group mortality table for males and females 
net pension cost in was million and was allocated to cost of products sold and operating expenses based on salaries and wages 
at december   a one half percentage point decrease in the indicated assumptions would have the following effects in millions 
table of contents assumption funded status expense discount rate expected return on assets recent accounting pronouncements the accounting standards updates issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb that will be effective for the company in will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar and pays variable interest rates on borrowings under certain credit facilities 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange and interest rate movements 
the company may use a variety of financial and derivative instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue 
rather  the company s objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company may use forward exchange contracts  options and other hedging activities to hedge the us dollar value resulting from anticipated currency transactions and net monetary asset and liability positions 
at december   the currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the euro  swiss franc  canadian dollar  british pound  japanese yen  australian dollar  chinese yuan renminbi and south korean won 
it is not possible to determine the true impact of currency rate changes  however  the direct translation effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated 
in  the effect of the stronger us dollar compared to other currencies primarily the euro resulted in a decrease in sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
in  the calculated translation effect resulted in an increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
outlook we expect growth in every region of the world in in the americas  the continued recovery in the construction market should provide a tailwind for both our contractor and industrial segments 
further  we expect the general economic environment for industrial manufacturing to remain stable in the united states through although the economies of western europe are still struggling to find their footing  we expect growth from the emerging markets of eastern europe to drive moderate growth in the emea region in while our asia pacific region will continue to face weak economic conditions and difficult comparables into the first half of  we are hopeful that the business will gain momentum as the year progresses 
with a modest increase in volumes  we expect factory performance in to remain solid and continue to drive profitability 
the graco team is focused on executing our strategies for growth in the company s backlog is typically small compared to annual sales and is not a good indicator of future business levels 
in addition to economic growth  the successful launch of new products and expanded distribution coverage  the sales outlook is dependent on many factors  including realization of price increases and stable foreign currency exchange rates
