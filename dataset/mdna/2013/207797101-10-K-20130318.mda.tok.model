item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations commitments and contingencies 
competition our regulated companies face competition from a few small privately owned water systems operating within  or adjacent to  our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas 
employees as of december   we employed a total of people 
our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
organizational review as part of a broader organizational review  beginning in july  the company examined both its connecticut regulated and unregulated operations to ensure that it is maximizing the company s financial results while maintaining the high quality water and service our customers have come to expect 
during the third quarter of  the company determined that a targeted reduction in workforce was appropriate 
the company eliminated approximately positions that centered on traditional managerial  officer and overhead positions 
the company did not eliminate positions in direct service of its customers

water activities the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of our regulated companies with the exception of certain real estate transactions 
real estate transactions our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies 
through land donations and sales in previous years  the company earned tax credits to use in future years 
the company is limited by time and the amount of taxable income when using these credits 
during and  the company did not make any land sales or donations  however  it did adjust its valuation allowances 
during  the company finalized a land sale with the town of plymouth  connecticut to sell approximately acres of land for open space and recreational purposes 
the company and town agreed on a sale price of million  generating  in income in the real estate transactions segment 
a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows income loss from real estate transactions from continuing operations regulated unregulated total services and rentals our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies in the state of connecticut and through maine water in the state of maine 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property 
linebacker is an optional service line protection program offered by the company to eligible residential customers through newus covering the cost of repairs for leaking or broken water service lines which provide drinking water to a customer home 
for customers who enroll in this program  the company will repair or replace a leaking or broken water service line  curb box  curb box cover  meter pit  meter pit cover  meter pit valve plus in home water main shut off valve before the meter 
for over two years  newus has offered expanded coverage to connecticut water customers for failure of in home plumbing  sewer and septic drainage lines and implemented modified terms and conditions with limitations on certain coverages 
in  the company experienced nearly enrollment growth in expanded coverage options  primarily due to customers upgrading from the basic water plan 
as of december   the company had  customers enrolled in its linebacker protection program 
depending on the coverage selected  linebacker prices range between and plus sales tax per year for residential customers 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan  have limited competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while still a relatively small portion of our overall business  has grown over the past five years and has provided over of our overall net income in   and  respectively 
net income generated by this segment of our business was   and  for the years   and  respectively 
item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  see the discussion in forward looking information in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements 
because we incur significant capital expenditures annually  we depend on the rates we charge our customers  which are subject to regulation 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the pura in connecticut and the mpuc in maine 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses 
currently  the company anticipates that connecticut water may file with the pura for its next general rate case in maine water expects that it will file a general rate case with the mpuc for at least three of its water systems at some point during bswc expects that it will not file a rate case until at the earliest 
once a rate increase petition is filed with the respective agency  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by each agency  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  a regulatory agency may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
under a connecticut law  the pura may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism  known as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica  for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers 
the maine legislature is currently in the process of formalizing a temporary surcharge for infrastructure replacement and repairs tsirr  a wica like mechanism that will allow for expedited recovery of infrastructure improvements 
the company expects that our regulated companies in the state of maine will be able to take advantage of the surcharge in late or early if we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due  or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of december   we had million in long term debt outstanding and million in bank loans payable 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  and  if necessary  borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash  we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity  which may be on terms that are not favorable to the company as current terms 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents  which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness 
credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt  borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt 
during certain periods of the unites states credit and liquidity crisis of  the volatility and disruption in the credit and banking markets reached unprecedented levels 
in many cases  the markets contained limited credit capacity for certain issuers  and lenders had requested shorter terms 
the market for new debt financing was limited and in some cases not available at all 
in addition  the markets had increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments 
the company noted improvements during the second half of and continuing through if market disruption and volatility return  the company may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due  draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt  which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 
since  standard poor ratings services has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary the connecticut water company 
their evaluations are based on a number of factors  which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
on october   standard poor ratings services s p affirmed its a corporate credit rating on the company  however  s p revised the company s ratings outlook from stable to negative 
the negative outlook reflected s p s expectation of weaker credit metrics as a result of the debt the company planned to incur to complete the acquisition of aqua maine as well as additional near term debt funding of the company s capital expenditure program 
s p also indicated that if the company were to issue a material amount of common equity in the future  this step could lead s p to revise the outlook to stable 
on october   s p reaffirmed this rating and outlook 
while the company completed a common equity offering in december of raising approximately million in net proceeds for the company  s p has not yet revised their outlook 
our inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations 
we are obligated to comply with debt covenants under our loan and debt agreements 
failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default  which if not timely cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date  could limit future borrowings  and result in cross default issues and increase our borrowing costs 
the covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position 
as detailed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations  which may affect investment returns  which may fall below the company s projected return rates 
a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value 
additionally  the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements 
further  changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
also  future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers  and the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater operations are governed by extensive federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states  the state of connecticut and or the state of maine 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that either the pura or the mpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to fully recover such costs 
in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
climate change laws and regulations may be adopted that could require compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards and other climate change initiatives 
additional capital expenditures could be required and our operating costs could be increased in order to comply with new regulatory standards imposed by federal and state environmental agencies 
climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide 
many scientists  legislators  and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
possible new climate change laws and regulations  if enacted  may require us to monitor and or change our utility operations 
it is possible that new standards could be imposed that will require additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs 
because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted  we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
although these expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that either the pura or the mpuc or other regulatory bodies that govern our business would permit us to recover such expenditures and costs 
we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with new standards or laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
new streamflow regulations in connecticut could potentially impact our ability to serve our customers 
in december  new regulations concerning the flow of water in connecticut s rivers and streams became law 
as promulgated  the regulations require that certain downstream releases be made from seven of the connecticut waters eighteen active reservoirs no later than ten years following the adoption of stream classifications  a process which has recently been initiated by the department of energy and environmental protection deep 
currently  releases are made at two locations 
no groundwater supply wells are affected by the regulations 
although significantly and favorably modified from prior versions  the regulations still have the potential to lower our safe yield  raise our capital and operating expenses and adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
because they affect only a subset of the company supplies and allow for releases to be scaled back in response to drought events  however  the overall impact is anticipated to be manageable 
costs associated with the regulations may be recovered in the form of higher rates  although there can be no assurance the pura would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
recently proposed legislation would expand the current wica mechanism to allow for customer surcharges to recover the costs associated with the capital improvements necessary to achieve compliance with the streamflow regulations 
the state of maine also has regulations that govern the flow of water in rivers and streams and also govern lake levels on great ponds 
code of maine rules chapter chapter regulates any activity that alters the flow or level of classified state waters after august maine water operates four water systems that use surface waters governed by this chapter 
bswc operates one water system that uses surface water governed by this chapter 
both companies have operated in full compliance with the chapter since its effective date and fully expect continued compliance 
for public water systems  chapter allows the maine department of environmental protection mdep to impose site specific conditions in locations where maine water quality classifications are not being met 
any conditions proposed on a water withdrawal by a public water system must consider the provisions of any legislative charter  the watershed protection benefits provided by the utility and the financial viability of the utility 
further  any conditions imposed must be accommodated by the existing mpuc approved rate schedule for the utility and may not  in and of themselves  cause a utility to request a rate increase from their customers 
to date  the mdep has not imposed any withdrawal conditions on any public water system in maine 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could adversely affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
declining per customer residential water usage may reduce our revenues  financial condition and results of operations in future years 
a trend of declining per customer residential water usage in connecticut and maine has been observed for the last several years  which we would attribute to increased water conservation  including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users 
our regulated business is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use 
the rate we charge for our water is regulated by the pura in connecticut and the mpuc in maine and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand 
declining volume of residential water usage may have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process 
potential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers demand for water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and or secure new sources  as required 
insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although not occurring in  drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems 
we rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
a loss of these systems or major problems with the operation of these systems could affect our operations and have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 
with the implementation of the company s new enterprise resource planning erp system in the first quarter of  connecticut water delayed customer billings in order to verify the integrity of the system and the accuracy of those bills prior to mailing 
connecticut water has returned to normal billing and collection processes and does not anticipate delays in billing or collection in subsequent periods 
the delay in billing contributed to the increase in the company s bad debt expense for the years ending december  and  due to the reserve policy based upon aging of the receivables 
during and  connecticut water saw progress towards resolving the collection issues  primarily through the ability to charge interest and shut off customers for non payment 
connecticut water has experienced a reduction in the age of its accounts receivable in due in part to the collection process changes referred to above 
the failure of  or the requirement to repair  upgrade or dismantle  any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we own and operate numerous dams throughout the states of connecticut and maine 
while the company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs  a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any failure of our reservoirs  storage tanks  mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 
connecticut water and maine water distribute water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across connecticut and maine 
a failure of major mains  reservoirs  or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of major mains  reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs 
such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators  including the pura and the mpuc  and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and reputation 
any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
we may encounter difficulties consolidating bswc into our business and may not fully attain or retain  or achieve within a reasonable time frame  expected strategic objectives  cost savings and other expected benefits of the acquisition 
we recently completed the acquisition of bswc on december   our second acquisition in the state of maine 
this acquisition further increased the size of our regulated water utility business and further expanded our business operations in the state of maine 
we expect to realize strategic and other benefits as a result of our acquisition of bswc 
our efforts at integrating bswc into the company have been ongoing and have been successful to date 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve higher revenues or benefit from any synergies as a result of the acquisition and our ability to fully realize the strategic benefits from consolidating bswc s business with ours  is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including  among others the challenges of consolidating businesses  including workforces  processes and information systems  the costs of consolidating bswc and managing and enhancing its operations may be higher than we expect and may require more resources  capital investments and management attention than anticipated  employees important to bswc s operations may decide not to continue employment with us  and we may be unable to anticipate or manage risks that are unique to bswc s historical business  including those related to its workforce  customer base  local demographics and information systems 
if we fail to complete an effective integration of bswc into the company  our anticipated growth in revenue  profitability  and cash flow resulting from the purchase of bswc could be adversely affected 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
as of the date of this filing  our regulated companies serve more than  customers  or a population of approximately  people  in municipalities throughout connecticut and maine 
we will be unable to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses  including maine water and bswc  could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 
some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to possible contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
increased security measures may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition 
we make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding  among others the number of years to depreciate certain assets  amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable and uninsured losses  our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims  including medical and workers compensation claims  future costs for pensions and other post retirement benefit obligations  and possible tax allowances 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period 
if our estimates are not accurate  we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

unresolved staff comments none item properties at december   the properties of our regulated companies consisted of land  easements  rights including water rights  buildings  reservoirs  standpipes  dams  wells  supply lines  treatment plants  pumping plants  transmission and distribution mains and conduits  mains and other facilities and equipment used for the collection  purification  storage and distribution of water 
in certain cases  connecticut water is or may be a party to limited contractual arrangements for the provision of water supply from neighboring utilities 
we believe that our properties are in good operating condition 
water mains are located  for the most part  in public streets and  in a few instances  are located on land that we own in fee simple and or land utilized pursuant to easement right  most of which are perpetual and adequate for the purpose for which they are held 
the net utility plant of the company at december  was solely owned by the regulated companies 
the net utility plant balance as of december  was  approximately million more than the balance of net utility plant as of december   due primarily to the acquisitions of maine water and bswc  normal plant additions  and construction spending related to infrastructure improvements 
sources of water supply owned  maintained  and operated by our regulated companies include twenty five surface water supplies and ninety nine well fields  as of december  in addition  connecticut water has agreements with various neighboring water utilities to provide water  at negotiated rates  to our water systems 
collectively  these sources have the capacity to deliver approximately seventy four million gallons of potable water daily to the twenty five major operating systems 
the regulated companies own  maintain  and operate fifty two small  non interconnected satellite and consecutive water systems that  combined  have the ability to deliver about three million gallons of additional water per day to their respective systems 
for some small consecutive water systems  purchased water may comprise substantially all of the total available supply of the system 
as of december   the regulated companies own and operate thirty water filtration facilities  having a combined treatment capacity of approximately fifty two million gallons per day 
as of december   the transmission and distribution systems of the regulated companies consisted of approximately  miles of main 
on that date  approximately seventy five percent of our mains were eight inch diameter or larger 
substantially all new main installations are cement lined ductile iron pipe of eight inch diameter or larger 
we believe that our properties are maintained in good condition and in accordance with current regulations and standards of good waterworks industry practice

recognizing the importance of timely infrastructure replacement and improvement  the company  along with other investor owned regulated water companies in the state of connecticut  campaigned for the passage of the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica act in the connecticut general assembly  which was adopted in wica allows connecticut water to add a surcharge to customers bills  subject to an expedited review and approval by the pura and no more than twice a year  to reflect the replacement of certain types of aging utility plant  principally water mains  meters  service lines and water conservation related investments 
similarly  the maine legislature is currently in the process of formalizing a temporary surcharge for infrastructure replacement and repairs tsirr  a wica like mechanism that will allow for expedited recovery of infrastructure improvements 
the company expects that our regulated companies in the state of maine will be able to take advantage of the surcharge in late or early on january   connecticut water filed a wica application with the pura requesting an additional surcharge to customer bills related to approximately million spending on wica projects

the company has and will continue to focus on minimizing operating costs that are passed along to its customers without sacrificing the quality service it values and the customers demand 
at the same time  the company will continue to employ its current strategy of timely collection of appropriate costs and a fair rate of return for its shareholders through appropriate rates for its regulated water service 
as part of a broader organizational review  beginning in july  the company examined both its regulated and unregulated operations in connecticut to ensure that it is maximizing the company s financial results while maintaining the high quality water and service our customers have come to expect

during  the company entered into discussions to sell approximately acres of land to the town of plymouth  ct for open space purposes 
the town was awarded a watershed and open space grant from the connecticut department of environmental protection to assist in purchasing the land 
this transaction allowed the company to receive financial benefit by disposing of property that is no longer needed for public water supply purposes while at the same time supporting environmental stewardship by ensuring the property is permanently maintained as open space

regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
our regulated water companies ability to recover its increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the rates we charge our customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the appropriate regulatory agency through formal rate proceedings 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as customer usage  future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise our rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
our regulated water utilities are also subject to environmental and water quality regulations  which are continually modified and refined to ensure the safety of the company s water sources and  ultimately  the public s health 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
while there can be no guarantee that all expenditures related to increased regulation will be recoverable in rate proceedings  the company believes that the regulatory environment in connecticut and maine would allow prudent expenditures to be recovered in rates 
to date  the company has never had any costs associated with water quality and environmental spending refused in a general rate proceeding 
the company believes that it is in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc regulated operations fasb asc  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as connecticut water and maine water to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc revenue recognition the company s accounting policies regarding revenue recognition by segment are as follows water activities most of our water customers are billed quarterly  with the exception of larger commercial and industrial customers  as well as public and private fire protection customers who are billed monthly 
most customers  except fire protection customers  are metered 
revenues from metered customers are based on their water usage multiplied by approved  regulated rates and are earned when water is delivered 
public fire protection revenues are based on the length of the water main  and number of hydrants in service and are earned on a monthly basis 
private fire protection charges are based on the diameter of the connection to the water main 
our regulated companies accrue an estimate for metered customers for the amount of revenues earned relating to water delivered but unbilled at the end of each quarter 
real estate transactions revenues are recorded when a sale or other transaction has been completed and title to the real estate has been transferred 
upon completion of any real estate transaction  the company no longer has any continuing involvement in the property 
services and rentals revenues are recorded when the company has delivered the services called for by contractual obligation 
employee benefit plan accounting management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the pension and postretirement plan liabilities 
management further considers rates of high quality corporate bonds of approximate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the discount rate assumption we use to value our pension and postretirement benefit obligations has a material impact on the amount of expense we record in a given period 
our and pension expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
our and post retirement welfare expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
in  our pension and postretirement welfare expense will be calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
the following table shows how much a one percent change in our assumed discount rate would have changed our reported pension and postretirement expense increase decrease in pension expense increase decrease in postretirement expense increase in the discount rate decrease in the discount rate other assumptions that affect the costs associated with our benefit plans include the assumed rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increase 
the company has assumed an return on plan investments for and  and a rate of compensation increase for our pension and post retirement welfare plans  in and the assumed health care trend rate was at december  and  respectively 
goodwill as part of the purchase of regulated water companies  the company recorded goodwill of million representing the amount of the purchase price over net book value of the assets acquired 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification intangibles goodwill and other fasb asc 
for a roll forward of the company goodwill balance  see note as part of fasb asc  the company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test  which we perform as of december each year 
we update the test between the annual testing if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
step one of the test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value  step two must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment loss 
if the carrying value is less than fair value  further testing for goodwill impairment is not performed 
step two of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill against the carrying value of the goodwill 
in step two  determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date 
the difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge  if any  would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two 
in performing the annual goodwill impairment test  for purposes of the step one analysis  the company bases the determination of the fair value of its reporting unit on the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on discounted future cash flows 
based on the completion of step one of the annual impairment analysis  management determined that the fair value of the water activities reporting unit was greater than its carrying value 
we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our performance 
those market events could include a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan  significant adverse rate case results  changes in capital investment budgets or changes in interest rates that could permanently impair the fair value of a reporting unit 
recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively impact our reported results of operation and total capitalization  the effects of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings  secure financing on favorable terms  maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 
outlook the company s earnings and profitability are primarily dependent upon the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
the company s earnings and profitability in future years will also depend upon a number of other factors  such as the ability to maintain our operating costs at current or lower levels  customer growth in the company s core regulated water utility businesses  growth in revenues attributable to non water sales operations  availability and desirability of land no longer needed for water delivery for land sales  and the timing and adequacy of rate relief when requested  from time to time  by our regulated water companies
