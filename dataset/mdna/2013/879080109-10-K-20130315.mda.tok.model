grapevine development area the grapevine development area  or grapevine  is an approximately  acre potential development area located on the san joaquin valley floor area of our lands  adjacent to trcc 
the conservation agreement allows for the development of up to  acres in this area 
california regulatory dynamics may impact the future ability to entitle new development so we intend to begin the land planning and entitlement process for grapevine during to take advantage of the existing favorable pro business and political climate in kern county 
we will be performing the necessary due diligence  documentation  and public process for what will ultimately be a new mixed use community 
this process will take several years and the investment of several million dollars to successfully complete 
joint ventures we are also involved in multiple joint ventures with several partners 
our joint venture with travelcenters of america  or ta petro  owns and operates two travel and truck stop facilities  and also operates three separate gas stations with convenience stores within trcc west and trcc east 
we are involved in two joint ventures with rockefeller development group  the five west parcel llc  which owns a  square foot building in trcc west  that is fully leased  and the west llc  which owns acres of land for future development within trcc west 
resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement and land stewardship and conservation activities 
we have two major resort residential communities within this segment  one of which  tmv  has litigation free entitlement approvals  and one of which  the centennial community  is still progressing through the entitlement process in los angeles county 
the entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete 
the conservation agreement that we signed in is designed to minimize the opposition from environmental groups to these projects and eliminate or reduce the time spent in litigation once governmental approvals are received 
litigation by environmental groups has been a primary cause of delay and loss of financial value for real estate development projects in california 
the centennial development is a large master planned community development encompassing approximately  acres of our land within los angeles county 
upon completion of centennial  it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when complete  would create a substantial number of jobs 
centennial is being developed by centennial founders  llc  a consolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest as of december  our partners in this joint venture are pardee homes  lewis investment company and standard pacific corp 
in  our partners in centennial founders llc elected to become non contributing capital partners due to the financial difficulties facing homebuilders and the downturn within the real estate industry 
as a result  the company began funding of centennial founders llc s current operations  thereby diluting each other partner s percentage ownership 
this change in funding occurred in july prior to that time the company was contributing of the capital funds necessary to pursue entitlement and development efforts undertaken by this joint venture 
we expect to continue funding all entitlement and pre development activities for the near future 
since the initial submittal of our administrative level eir with respect to the centennial community to los angeles county  we have continued to receive feedback from the los angeles planning department and have submitted several revisions of our administrative eir as we work towards the public filing of our eir and final approval 
we cannot estimate when or if this approval will be granted  but the process is being actively pursued 
in addition to the eir  we have submitted a variety of other reports required as part of the entitlement process including our specific plan  tentative tract maps  geological reports  traffic reports  and water supply assessment reports 
centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly and commercially viable development 
our plan is for a sustainable program that provides for the needs of the community while protecting the environment and will be achieved through our continuing focus on responsible use of limited resources and progressive construction design 
we recognize the need to balance expensive green program certifications with the practicality of investing those same funds in environmentally sound building elements 
tejon mountain village community in addition to the centennial community project  we are currently engaged in the development of tmv 
tmv is envisioned as an exclusive  very low density  resort based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities  lodging and spa facilities  world class golf facilities  a range of housing options  and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish tmv as the resort of choice for the southern california market 
tmv is being developed by dmb tmv llc  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest 
our partner in this joint venture is dmb pacific  a subsidiary of dmb associates inc  or dmb  which is a leading resort recreational planned community developer 
under the joint venture agreement  the parties have agreed to secure all entitlements and all necessary regulatory approvals  to master plan  develop and sell parcels and homes to end users  and to develop and own  sell or joint venture commercial properties  hotels  and golf course sites in tmv 
in october  tmv received unanimous entitlement approval from the kern county board of supervisors 
in november  a group of parties led by the center for biological diversity  or cbd  filed a lawsuit claiming that our environmental impact report  or eir  was inadequate 
in november  kern county superior court judge kenneth twissleman ruled in favor of the company  its development partner dmb  and kern county when he found that kern county had properly analyzed and evaluated the environmental effects of tmv 
judge twissleman rejected claims made by cbd  along with other parties  that our eir  for tmv was inadequate 
the findings of judge twissleman were appealed by cbd on february  on april   the california fifth district court of appeal  or court of appeal  panel issued its unanimous opinion affirming the trial court favorable judgment against cbd in every respect 
on may   cbd filed a timely petition for rehearing  which the court of appeal summarily denied on may  thereafter no petition for review by the california supreme court was filed and time for such review has now expired 
the court of appeal s affirmation allows the company to proceed with it proposed development of tmv as a premier resort community 
timing of tmv development in the coming years will be dependent on the continued improvement of the economy and an improvement in the second home real estate market 
the greatest competition for the centennial community will come from california developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
mineral resources as mineral resource revenues have grown management has increased its focus on this segment as an area of future growth 
this renewed focus and interest in mineral resources has resulted from the growth in revenues and from the potential of future growth through new leases and drilling 
the growth in revenues has come from increased oil exploration  new production  and an overall higher price for oil in kern county 
our goal is to continue to market our mineral assets for leasing and encourage new exploration to potentially increase revenues due to the high margins created from these activities 
we lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas  but do not ourselves engage in any such exploratory or extractive activities 
as of december   approximately  acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately  barrels of oil and  mcf each mcf being  cubic feet of dry gas during our share of production  based upon average royalty rates during the last three years  has been   and  barrels of oil per day for   and  respectively 
approximately active oil wells were located on the leased land as of december  royalty rates on our leases averaged in during  overall production increased  barrels over the previous year 
we also have a significant development and exploration lease with sojitz energy venture  inc covering approximately  acres in the san joaquin valley portion of the company s land 
estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us 
we do not make such estimates  and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us 
we have approximately  acres under lease to national cement company of california  inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
national owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a capacity of approximately  tons of cement per year 
the amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant  which increased slightly in compared to the continued low level of shipments is the direct result of reduced construction activity due to the slow economic recovery 
the term of this lease expires in  but national has options to extend the term for successive periods of and years 
proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process 
the company is indemnified by the current and former tenants and at this time we have no cost related to the issues at the cement plant 
see item  legal proceedings  for a further discussion 
we also lease acres to granite construction and griffith construction for the mining of rock and aggregate product that is used in construction of roads and bridges 
the royalty revenues we receive under these leases are based upon the amount of product produced from the many sites 
our royalty interests are contractually defined and based on a percentage of production and are received in cash 
our royalty revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil  natural gas  and rock and aggregate product  the inevitable decline in production of existing wells and quarries  and other factors affecting the third party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate on our minerals including the cost of development and production 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage winegrapes  almonds  and pistachios  we manage the farming of alfalfa and forage mix on acres in the antelope valley and we periodically lease acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices we receive for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through proven cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 
sales of our grape crop typically occurs in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year  while sales of our pistachio and almond crops also typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year  but can occur up to a year or more after each crop is harvested 
in  we sold of our grape crop to one winery  to a second winery and the remainder to one other customer 
these sales are under long term contracts ranging from one to thirteen years 
in  our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers  with the largest buyer accounting for  respectively of our almond revenues 
in  the majority of our pistachios were sold to two customers  purchasing approximately and of the crop  respectively 
we do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of any or all of these large buyers because of the markets for these commodities  the large number of buyers that would be available to us  and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract 
nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
crop prices  especially almonds  are also adversely affected by a strong us dollar which makes us exports more expensive and decreases demand for the products we produce 
the value of the dollar over the last few years has helped to maintain strong almond prices in the us and in overseas markets 
our water entitlement for  available from the california state water project  or swp  when combined with supplemental water  was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources  or dwr  has announced its early estimated water supply delivery at of full entitlement 
we anticipate that this current year allocation will be sufficient for our farming needs 
it is possible that when the current swp allocation is combined with other available water resources  such as groundwater and surface sources  the company may be able to bank additional water in for future use 
see discussion of water contract entitlement and long term outlook for water supply under item  properties 
general environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws relating to water  air  solid waste and hazardous substances 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not incur costs  penalties  and liabilities  including those relating to claims for damages to property or natural resources  resulting from our operations 
we also expect continued legislation and regulatory development in the area of climate change and green house gases 
it is unclear as of this date how any such developments will affect our business 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations  or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations  might require expenditures in the future

item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves significant risk and could result in operating losses 
we are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial supply of similar product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
a downturn in national or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business 
although real estate industry conditions improved during fiscal  the general us economy remains relatively weak 
recent industry results and other national data indicate that the overall demand within the real estate industry improved during fiscal however national real estate activity remains below historical levels due to the current weak us economic conditions  the restrictive mortgage lending environment and variations in local market conditions 
the us economy could be negatively impacted in the short term by potential changes in fiscal  tax and monetary policies currently under consideration by the federal government 
therefore  it remains uncertain whether the real estate industry conditions will continue to improve  remain stable or deteriorate from current levels 
a subsequent deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 
higher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 
we are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals and permits for our developments that could be denied 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
all of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations  so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied 
in addition  the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project 
in addition  many states  cities and counties including neighboring ventura county have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures 
if that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the company s land use  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
third party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation could result in denial of the right to develop  or would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
we are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
federal and state environmental laws also govern the construction and operation of our projects and require compliance with various environmental regulations  including analysis of the environmental impact of our projects and evaluation of our reduction in the projects carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications  or preclude development in specific areas 
in addition  in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously  so litigation challenging their approval is expected 
the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin  potential impacts of projects on the california condor and other species of concern  the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors  potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in los angeles county  emissions of greenhouse gases  water availability and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being sprawl 
in addition  california has a specific statutory and regulatory scheme intended to reduce green house gas emissions in the state and efforts to enact federal legislation to address climate change concerns could require further reductions in our projects carbon footprint in the future 
constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our cost of capital 
during the recent economic downturn  we relied principally on positive operating cash flow  cash and investments  and equity offerings to meet current working capital needs  entitlement investment  and investment within our developments 
while the current economy has seen improvement  any slowdown in the economy could negatively impact our access to credit markets and may limit our sources of liquidity in the future and potentially increase our costs of capital 
until governmental entitlements are received  we will have a limited inventory of real estate 
each of our four current and planned real estate projects  trcc  centennial  tmv  and the grapevine development area involve obtaining various governmental permits and or entitlements 
a delay in obtaining governmental approvals could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users 
we are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
once they receive all necessary permits  approvals and entitlements  centennial will ultimately compete with other residential housing options in the region  such as developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects 
intense competition may decrease our sales and harm our results of operations 
our developable land is concentrated entirely in california 
all of our developable land is in california and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within california  any adverse change in the economic climate of california  or our regions of that state  and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of california  or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
ultimately  our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations 
increases in taxes or government fees could increase our cost  and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce demand for homes in our future residential communities 
increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space  and road improvements  could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  any changes to income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners  such as a change limiting the deductibility of real estate taxes or interest on home mortgages  could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing  which in turn could reduce future sales 
if we experience shortages or increased costs of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control  there could be delays or increased costs within our industrial development  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to develop our current industrial development may be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control including work stoppages  labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people  changes in laws relating to union organizing activity  and shortages  delays in availability  or fluctuations in prices of building materials 
any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of  or could increase the cost of  developing infrastructure and buildings within our industrial development 
if any of the above happens  our operating results could be harmed 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to pursue land development 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
our business model is very dependent on transactions with strategic partners 
we may not be able to successfully attract desirable strategic partners  complete agreements with strategic partners  and or manage relationships with strategic partners going forward  any of which could adversely affect our business 
for several years a key to our development and value creation strategies has been the use of joint ventures and strategic relationships 
these joint venture partners bring development experience  industry expertise  financial resources  financing capabilities  brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets 
a complicating factor in any joint venture is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors related to our business 
these competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan 
we may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial position of the strategic partner deteriorates 
if we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners  our business could be adversely affected 
only a limited market exists for our common stock  which could lead to price volatility 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of february   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
decreases in the market value of our investments in marketable securities could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we have significant amount of funds invested in marketable securities the market value of which is subject to changes from period to period 
decreases in the market value of our marketable securities could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs  unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  inflation can result in increased costs of construction and can reduce operating margins as increases in operating costs result in deteriorating margins on long term fixed lease agreements 
a prolonged downturn in the real estate market or continued instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry  could have an adverse effect on our real estate business 
our residential housing projects  centennial and tmv  are currently in the entitlement phase or fully entitled and waiting for development to begin 
if a downturn in the real estate market or an instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry exists at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases  our resort residential business could be adversely affected 
excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in housing prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available 
the inability of potential commercial industrial clients to get adequate financing for the expansion of their businesses could lead to reduced lease revenues and sales of land within our industrial development 
volatile oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
our cash flows and results of operations are dependent in part on oil and gas prices  which are volatile 
oil and natural gas prices also impact the amount we receive for selling and renewing our mineral leases 
moreover  oil and natural gas prices depend on factors we cannot control  such as changes in foreign and domestic supply and demand for oil and natural gas  actions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  weather  political conditions in other oil producing countries  including the possibilities of insurgency or war in such areas  prices of foreign exports  domestic and international drilling activity  price and availability of alternate fuel sources  the value of the us dollar relative to other major currencies  the level and effect of trading in commodity markets  the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and governmental regulations 
any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas could have a negative impact on our business  liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 
the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally decline as reserves are produced 
any decline in production or reserves could materially and adversely affect our future cash flow  liquidity and results of operations 
we may encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including difficulty in securing adequate water resources for future developments  water delivery and water availability continues to be a long term concern within california 
any limitation of delivery of swp water and the absence of available alternatives during drought periods could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards 
natural risks  such as geological and soil problems  earthquakes  fire  heavy rains and flooding  and heavy winds  shortages of qualified trades people  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of materials 
information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 
we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records 
these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers  web browsers  telephone systems and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches  cyber attacks  significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past 
a material network breach in the security of our information technology systems could include the theft of customer  employee or company data 
the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners  or by regulators  and the outcome of such proceedings  which could include penalties or fines  could have significant negative impact on our business 
we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future 
we routinely utilize information technology experts to assist us in our evaluation of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems  and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data 
however  we cannot provide assurance that a security breach  cyber attack  data theft or other significant systems failures will not occur in the future  and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

item properties our approximate  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
our corporate offices are located on our property 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan  or the general plan  for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the general plan is intended to provide general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to any amendment of the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies that contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing entitlements for the centennial master planned community on approximately  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain  much of which is not presently served by paved roads or by utility or water lines 
much of this property is included within the conservation agreement we entered into with five of the major environmental organizations in june as we receive entitlement approvals over the life span of our developments we will dedicate conservation easements on  acres of this land  which will preclude future development of the land 
this acreage includes many of the most environmentally sensitive areas of our property and is home to many plant and wildlife species whose environments will remain undisturbed 
any significant development on our currently undeveloped land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species  wetlands issues  and greenhouse gas emissions  which may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays or certain changes to the scope of development in order to obtain governmental approval 
water operations our existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  or wheeler ridge  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the swp  to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the terms of these contracts extend to under the contracts  we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
it is assumed  that at the end of the current contract period all water contracts will be extended for approximately the same amount of annual water 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional water entitlement from the swp sufficient to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  or tcwd  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in trcc  has  acre feet of swp entitlement also called table a amount 
in addition  tcwd has approximately  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tcwd and our company 
tcwd is the water supplier to trcc  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tmv 
we have a acre water bank consisting of nine ponds on our land in southern kern county 
water is pumped into these ponds and then percolates into underground aquifers 
since  we have purchased  acre feet of water from the antelope valley east kern water agency  or avek  which has been pumped from the california aqueduct and is currently retained in this water bank 
in and we contracted for  additional acre feet of water from avek  but have deferred delivery of the water to a future year 
we anticipate adding additional water to the water bank in the future  as water is available 
in we began participating in the newly formed avek water banking program and we have approximately  acre feet of water to our credit in this program 
in recent years we have also been purchasing water for our future use or sale 
in we purchased  acre feet of transferable water and in we purchased an additional  acre feet of transferable water  all of which is currently held on our behalf by avek 
we also have secured swp entitlement under long term swp water contracts within the tulare lake basin water storage district and the dudley ridge water district  totaling  acre feet of swp entitlement annually  subject to swp allocations these contracts extend through during  swp allocations were of contract levels  and wheeler ridge was able to supply us with sufficient water to meet our farming demands from various sources 
in some years  there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the swp water 
both wheeler ridge and tcwd are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
at this time  wheeler ridge expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the swp allocations exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if swp allocations are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then wheeler ridge may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfer from others  and water banking assets to supply the needs of our farming and development activities 
water from these sources may be more expensive than swp water because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
a preliminary swp water allocation has been made by the dwr for all swp water contracts require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the swp and each water district  whether or not water is used or available 
wheeler ridge and tcwd contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 
portions of our property also have available groundwater  which we believe would be sufficient to supply commercial development in the interstate corridor 
ground water in the antelope valley basin is the subject of litigation 
see item  legal proceedings for additional information about this litigation 
there have been many environmental challenges regarding the movement of state project water through the sacramento delta 
operation of the delta pumps  are of primary importance to the california water system because these pumps are part of the system that moves water from northern california to southern california 
new biological opinions  or bos  issued by the us fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service in and contain restrictions on pumping from the delta 
these bos are being challenged in the courts by both water agencies and environmental groups 
judge wanger of the federal district court  eastern district of california  has determined that parts of the new bos related to the delta smelt and salmon species are insufficient and remanded the bos back to the us fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service for further analysis 
there are many groups  governmental and private  working together to develop a solution in the future to alleviate the curtailment of water from the delta 
historic swp restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in for this purpose  municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or commercial industrial developments 
other activities the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority  or trpffa  is a joint powers authority formed by kern county and tcwd to finance public infrastructure within the company s kern county developments 
trpffa has created two community facilities districts  or cfds  the west cfd and the east cfd 
the west cfd has placed liens on acres of the company s land to secure payment of special taxes related to  of bond debt sold by trpffa for trcc west 
the east cfd has placed liens on  acres of the company s land to secure payments of special taxes related to  of bond debt sold by trpffa for trcc east 
at trcc west  the west cfd has no additional bond debt approved for issuance 
at trcc east  the east cfd has approximately  of additional bond debt authorized by trpffa 
proceeds from the sales of these bonds are to reimburse the company for public infrastructure related to trcc east 
in  we received no reimbursements from trpffa 
in  we received  of reimbursement from these bond funds 
in   and  we paid approximately   and  respectively  in special taxes related to the cfds 
as development continues to occur at trcc  new owners of land and new lease tenants  through triple net leases  will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax 
as this happens  our obligation is reduced 
it is expected that we will have special tax payments in of approximately  but this could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding within each cfd and the amount of taxes paid by other owners and tenants 
during february  trpffa refinanced approximately  of bonds within the west cfd 
this refinancing  due to values in the west cfd and changes to bond requirements  allowed the company to be released from the requirement to provide a letter of credit and also allowed the west cfd to meet the value test for release of approximately  acres of the company s land from west cfd liens reducing the lien acreage to acres 
during december  trpffa sold  of bonds within the east cfd 
these bonds were sold in a series a tranche and a series b tranche 
series a bonds totaled  and are to be used to refinance the  of outstanding existing bonds 
the refinancing reduces overall interest cost  which reduces property taxes to land owners 
trpffa also sold an additional  of new series b bonds to be used by trpffa to reimburse the company for completed public infrastructure within trcc east 
it is expected during that the company will receive at least  in reimbursement based on current completed infrastructure 
item legal proceedings tejon mountain village on november   a suit was filed in the us district court for the eastern district of california fresno division by david laughing horse robinson plaintiff an alleged representative of the federally unrecognized kawaiisu tribe alleging  inter alia  that the company does not hold legal title to the land within the tmv development that it seeks to develop 
the grounds for the federal lawsuit were the subject of a united states supreme court decision in where the united states supreme court found against the indian tribes 
the suit named as defendants the company  two affiliates tejon mountain village  llc and tejon ranchcorp  the county of kern  and ken salazar  in his capacity as us secretary of the interior 
the company and other defendants filed motions to dismiss plaintiff complaint for failure to state a claim and lack of jurisdiction 
on january   the company received a ruling by judge wanger dismissing all claims against the company  tmv  the county and the federal defendants 
however  the judge did grant a limited right by the plaintiff to amend certain causes of action in the complaint 
during april   the plaintiff filed his second amended complaint against the company  alleging similar items as in the original suit 
the plaintiff filed new materials during july  related to his second amended complaint 
thereafter  the case was reassigned to magistrate judge mcauliffe 
on january   judge mcauliffe issued an order dismissing all claims in plaintiff second amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action and or for lack of jurisdiction  but allowed the plaintiff one more opportunity to state certain land claims provided plaintiff file an amended complaint on or before february  the court also indicated that it was considering dismissing the case due to the lack of federal recognition of the kawaiisu tribe 
the court then granted plaintiff an extension until march  to file his third amended complaint 
plaintiff filed his third amended complaint on march  defendants filed motions to dismiss all claims in the third amended complaint without further leave to amend on april  plaintiff thereafter substituted in new counsel and with leave of court filed his opposition papers on june  defendants filed their reply papers on june  oral argument of the motions to dismiss the third amended complaint was conducted on july  on august   the court issued its order dismissing all of robinson claims without leave to amend and with prejudice  on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim 
on september   robinson  through another law firm  filed a timely notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
on september   the court of appeals issued its time schedule order calling for briefing to be completed by february  robinson brief was due to be filed on january  on february   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit dismissed robinson appeal for failure to perfect the appeal as prescribed by the federal rules of appellate procedures 
national cement the company leases land to national cement company of california inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits on the leased acreage 
the california regional water quality control board  or rwqcb  for the lahontan region issued several orders in the late s with respect to environmental conditions on the property currently leased to national groundwater plume of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds 
this order directs the company s former tenant lafarge corporation  or lafarge  the current tenant national  and the company to  among other things  clean up groundwater contamination on the leased property

diesel fuel 
an order of the rwqcb directs lafarge  national and the company to clean up contamination from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline 
the company is advised that lafarge and national have substantially completed the groundwater cleanup and that groundwater monitoring remains an on going activity 
to date  the company is not aware of any failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders or informal requests of the rwqcb 
under current and prior leases  national and lafarge are obligated to indemnify the company for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of their use of the leased premises 
the company believes that all of the matters described above are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations and that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
if they do not and the company is required to perform the work at its own cost  it is unlikely that the amount of any such expenditure by the company would be material 
antelope valley groundwater cases on november   a conglomerate of public water suppliers filed a cross complaint in the los angeles superior court seeking a judicial determination of the rights to groundwater within the antelope valley basin  including the groundwater underlying the company land 
three phases of a multi phase trial have been completed 
upon completion of the third phase  the court ruled that the groundwater basin is currently in overdraft and established a current total sustainable yield 
the court has encouraged mediation sessions to settle remaining regional issues  such as groundwater pumping allocations and appointment of a regional water master 
several such mediation sessions have occurred  the most recent of which was held on november th and th  through these sessions  progress was made toward reaching a settlement on groundwater allocations and counsel for the various parties have worked to draft a stipulated judgment that may serve as a framework for settlement of the cases  although substantial conflicts remain to be resolved 
given the incremental progress toward resolution  the trial judge has scheduled the next phase of trial for may  allowing additional time for mediation and settlement discussions and encouraging further progress in order to avoid future trial costs 
it is too early to ascertain whether a settlement agreement will be reached and what effect  if any  this case may have on the centennial project or the company remaining lands in the antelope valley 
because the water supply plan for the centennial project includes several sources of water in addition to groundwater underlying the company lands  and because the creation of an efficient market for local water rights is frequently an outcome of adjudication proceedings  we anticipate that sufficient water to supply the company needs will continue to be available for its use regardless of the outcome of this case 
state water resources control board lawsuit on may   the california attorney general  on behalf of the state water resources control board  filed a complaint in the alameda county superior court for civil penalties and a permanent injunction against a number of travelcenters of america llc  or ta  facilities in the central valley of california 
the travel centers in the petro travel plaza holdings llc  or ta petro  were also included in the complaint 
the lawsuit alleges violations of various reporting  operating and monitoring regulations related to operation and maintenance of underground storage tanks 
in addition to the ta petro entity and its respective member entities  the lawsuit also names the company and tejon industrial corporation as defendants 
the company has tendered defense of the lawsuit to ta  under the defend and indemnify clause in the ta petro llc s operating agreement  and has also secured the services of an outside law firm to work with ta s outside counsel under a joint defense agreement 
on september   the company and tejon industrial corp 
were dismissed from the lawsuit  without prejudice 
the parties remaining are currently engaged in the discovery process and have had very preliminary discussions regarding a possible negotiated resolution 
at this point  however  the company has an insufficient basis to address the merits or potential outcomes of the lawsuit

water bank lawsuits on june   the central delta and south delta water agencies and several environmental groups  including cbd  filed a complaint in the sacramento county superior court against the california department of water resources dwr  kern county water agency and a number of real parties in interest  including the company and tcwd 
the lawsuit challenges certain amendments to the state water project contracts that were originally approved in  known as the monterey amendments 
the original environmental impact report  or eir  for the monterey amendments was determined to be insufficient in an earlier lawsuit  and the current lawsuit i challenges the remedial eir that dwr prepared as a result of the original lawsuit 
among other allegations  the current lawsuit also challenges the transfer of the kern water bank  or kwb  from dwr to kern county water agency and in turn to the kern water bank authority kwba  whose members are various kern and kings county interests  including tcwd  which tcwd has a interest in the kwba  and ii asserts the remedial eir is inadequate 
a parallel lawsuit was also filed by the same plaintiffs against kern county water agency  also naming the company and tcwd as real parties in interest  which has been stayed pending the outcome of the other action against dwr 
the company is named on the ground that it controls tcwd 
tcwd has a contract right for water stored in the kwb and rights to recharge and withdraw water 
counsel for the company is pursuing a dismissal of the company from these lawsuits 
in a preliminary favorable ruling on december   judge frawley in a tentative decision determined that the challenges to the transfer of the kwb were not timely and barred by the statutes of litigation and doctrine of latches 
there has not yet been any substantive hearing on the challenges to the eir 
given the preliminary nature of these lawsuits  the company has an insufficient basis to address the merits or potential outcomes of the lawsuit 
the monetary value of a potential adverse outcome on the claim likewise cannot be estimated at this time

overview we are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing  employment  and lifestyle needs of californians and to create value for our shareholders 
in support of these objectives  we have been investing in land planning and entitlement activities for new industrial and residential land developments and in infrastructure improvements within our active industrial development 
our prime asset is approximately  acres of contiguous  largely undeveloped land that  at its most southerly border  is miles north of los angeles and  at its most northerly border  is miles east of bakersfield 
our business model is designed to create value through the entitlement and development of land for commercial industrial and resort residential uses while at the same time protecting significant portions of our land for conservation purposes 
we operate our business near one of the country s largest population centers  which is expected to continue to grow well into the future 
we currently operate in four business segments commercial industrial real estate development  resort residential real estate development  mineral resources  and farming 
our commercial industrial real estate development generates revenues from building  grazing  and land lease activities  land and building sales  and ancillary land management activities 
the primary commercial industrial development is trcc and in efforts will begin to entitle the grapevine development area 
the resort residential real estate development segment is actively involved in the land entitlement and development process internally and through joint venture entities 
its revenues are generated through farming activities within the centennial joint venture 
within our resort residential segment  the two active developments are tmv and the centennial master planned community 
our mineral resources segment generates revenues from oil and gas royalty leases  rock and aggregate mining leases  and a lease with national cement 
the farming segment produces revenues from the sale of winegrapes  almonds  and pistachios 
the conservation agreement we entered into with five of the major environmental organizations in june calls for the possible permanent protection of up to  acres of our land through phased dedicated conservation easements on approximately  acres of our land at the time specific development milestones are achieved for tmv  centennial  and the grapevine development area   acres of open space within permitted project areas  and the purchase of conservation easements on an additional  acres of our land  which was completed during february for we had net income attributable to common stockholders of  compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of  for the first twelve months of when comparing to  the decrease is largely the result of the sale of conservation easements for  in  which is partially offset by improved in oil royalties  farming revenues  and a lower tax provision 
oil royalties improved  due primarily to a increase in production 
farming revenues grew by  during due largely to an increase in pistachio revenues that was partially offset by lower winegrape revenues 
for  we had net income attributable to common stockholders of  which is an increase of  when compared to the improvement in net income was due to an increase in revenues of  the increase in revenue were driven by the sale of conservation easements for  a land sale for  an increase in our oil royalties over the prior year of  and a  increase in farm revenues 
oil royalties improved due to higher prices and production and farming revenues improved due to higher almond and grape revenues 
these revenue improvements were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense when compared to during  stock compensation expense included a  reversal of cost and in we recognized stock compensation expense of  during  we will continue to invest funds in our joint ventures and internally toward the achievement of entitlements for our land and for infrastructure and building development within our active industrial developments 
the process of securing entitlements for our land is a long  arduous process that can take several years and often involves litigation 
during the next few years  our net income will fluctuate from year to year based upon commodity prices  production within our farming segment  and the timing of sales of land and the leasing of land within our industrial developments 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative discussion of our results of operations 
it contains the results of operations for each operating segment of the business and is followed by a discussion of our financial position 
it is useful to read the business segment information in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimates that are likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  stock compensation  our future ability to utilize deferred tax assets  and defined benefit retirement plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from lease revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease unless there is a considerable risk as to collectibility 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
lease revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
royalty revenues are contractually defined as to the percentage of royalty and are tied to production and market prices 
our royalty arrangements generally require payment on a monthly basis with the payment based on the previous month s activity 
we accrue monthly royalty revenues based upon estimates and adjust to actual as we receive payments 
from time to time the company sells easements over its land and the easements are either in the form of rights of access granted for such things as utility corridors or are in the form of conservation easements that generally require the company to divest its rights to commercially develop a portion of its land  but do not result in a change in ownership of the land or restrict the company from continuing other revenue generating activities on the land 
the sales of conservation easements that occurred in have been accounted for in accordance with staff accounting bulletin topic revenue recognition sab topic 
sab topic requires that the following four criteria be met before revenue may be recognized persuasive evidence of arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller price to buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
since the conservation easements do not impose any significant continuing performance obligations on the company  revenue from conservation easement sales has been recognized when the four criteria of sab topic have been met  which generally occurs in the period the sale has closed and consideration has been received 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in accounting standards codification  or asc  real estate retail land to record these sales 
asc provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  asc requires a land sale to be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold or be required to develop the property in the future 
during  we recognized deferred sales revenue of  at the time offsite infrastructure related to the land sale to caterpillar was completed 
in  we recognized  of revenue related to a land sale to caterpillar 
we fully recognized the revenues from all land sales in  as none of the requirements for deferral of revenue were present 
at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues are recognized and any related inventoried costs are expensed  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
it is not unusual for portions of our almond or pistachio crop to be sold in the year following the harvest 
orchard almond and pistachio revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are typically recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
these market price estimates are updated through the crop payment cycle as new information is received as to the final settlement price for the crop sold 
these estimates are adjusted to actual upon receipt of final payment for the crop 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 
for the orchard crops  we estimated almond revenue to be  or per pound on average  and pistachio revenue to be  or per pound on average 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years  final prices received on almonds have averaged from to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have averaged from to per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were from the midpoint 
as an example  the range for almonds used for was to per pound 
if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimated range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
actual final crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue by   and  in  and  respectively 
the adjustment includes  related to improving pistachio prices due to an aggressive industry marketing plan that increased demand and it also includes  from almonds due to higher prices driven by improved demand 
the adjustment for includes  related to pistachios due to higher prices driven by growing demand for the product and it also includes  from almonds due to increased demand that pushed almond prices higher 
the adjustment for includes  related to pistachios due to an improving price market resulting from low industry inventories  and  from almonds as increased demand pushed prices higher 
capitalization of costs the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land sales and leases when we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project  we follow asc  real estate retail land  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land  we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market and costs of construction change 
in preparing these estimates  we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward  due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
any increases to our estimates in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will become even more significant as we continue to move forward as a real estate development company 
the estimates used are very susceptible to change from period to period  due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of project completion  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
the impairment calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted 
we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
we currently operate in four segments  commercial industrial real estate development  resort residential real estate development  mineral resources  and farming 
at this time  there are no assets within any of our segments that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices  absorption  production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 
in estimating future prices  absorption  production  and costs  we use our internal forecasts and business plans 
we develop our forecasts based on recent sales data  historical absorption and production data  input from marketing consultants  as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers and potential purchasers of our farming products 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using level one and level two indicators  which are quoted prices in active markets and quoted prices for similar types of assets in active markets for the investments 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
the estimation of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities requires that we make use of estimates of present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates  salary growth  retirement rates  expected contributions  inflation  expected return on plan assets  and mortality rates the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s defined benefit plan consisted of a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
if we were to assume a basis point change in the discount rate used  our projected benefit obligation would change approximately stock based compensation we apply the recognition and measurement principles of asc  compensation stock compensation in accounting for long term stock based incentive plans 
our stock based compensation plans have historically included both stock options and stock grants 
we have not issued any stock options to employees or directors since january  and our financial statements do not reflect any compensation expenses for stock options 
all of our stock options are fully vested and all related expenses were recognized in prior year financial statements per gaap 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  stock compensation options  for additional information regarding stock options 
we also make stock awards to employees based upon time based criteria and through the achievement of performance related objectives 
performance related objectives are either stratified into threshold  target  and maximum goals or based on the achievement of a milestone event 
these stock awards are currently being expensed over the expected vesting period based on each performance criterion 
we make estimates as to the number of shares that will actually be granted based upon estimated ranges of success in meeting the defined performance measures

fair value measurements the financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange exit price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
this guidance establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability 
observable inputs are those which can be easily seen by market participants while unobservable inputs are generally developed internally  utilizing management s estimates and assumptions level valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  or by model based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market 
level valuation is derived from model based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on our own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability 
when available  we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value 
we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurement 
fair value measurements are used for marketable securities  investments within the pension plan and hedging instruments

results of operations by segment we evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results 
each segment is subject to review and evaluation as we monitor current market conditions  market opportunities  and available resources 
the performance of each segment is discussed below real estate commercial industrial during  our commercial industrial segment profits fell  compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in revenues that was partially offset by lower expenses 
commercial industrial segment revenues declined  during compared to primarily due to a  decrease in land sales revenue due to a land sale to caterpillar that occurred in december of there was also a  decrease in hunting revenues during compared to  resulting from the closure of our hunting program for the first eight months of the hunting program was closed for the first eight months of the year in order to update operational and ranch access programs and update hunting programs being offered 
on the positive side  revenues from our power plant lease with calpine improved  due to the growth in of percentage rent we receive based on a spark spread arrangement that is tied to the price of electricity and natural gas  compared to revenues from a grazing lease increased  during the year due to an annual lease adjustment  which is tied to the price of cattle 
when compared to  commercial industrial expenses decreased  primarily due to a  decrease in legal and professional fees related to sales transaction costs and costs related to an employee lawsuit 
cost capitalized to construction projects increased  and sales commissions decreased  related to the caterpillar land sale in repairs and maintenance expenses declined  in  mainly due to a reduction in costs associated with a park n ride facility owned by kern county that supports bus services to trcc 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in compensation mainly due to an increase in hiring  higher benefit costs  and a  increase in stock compensation due to the acceleration of the tmv ceqa milestone 
our commercial industrial segment profit during of  was an improvement of  when compared to primarily as a result of a  increase in revenues 
the primary contributors are as follows in december  we sold approximately acres of land located in trcc east to caterpillar and have recognized  of the sales price and deferred  to when offsite infrastructure related to the land sale will be completed 
partially offsetting the increase in revenues was a  increase in operating expenses 
 of this increase is attributable to the cost of the land sale to caterpillar 
 is attributable to an increase in stock compensation mainly due to the reversal of expense in an increase of  is attributable to professional fees and contingent costs  a portion of which is related to a lawsuit filed by a former employee during this suit and related matters were settled in january and february a  increase is attributable to repairs and maintenance expense mainly due to our contribution to a park n ride parking lot owned by kern county to shuttle passengers to and from bakersfield and trcc 
future activities within the commercial industrial segment continue to be focused on the marketing and development of commercial industrial and retail product within trcc east and completing the build out of trcc west 
these developments are being planned to coincide with what we anticipate to be future market demand  although the timing and extent of the future market demand is difficult for us to predict 
we continue to focus our efforts for trcc east and trcc west on the labor and logistical benefits of our site and success that current tenants and owners within our development have experienced 
our strategy fits within the logistics model that many companies are using  which favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are becoming difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
we believe that our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size can provide us with a potential marketing advantage in the future 
a potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the port of los angeles in comparison to the traditional warehouse distribution centers east of los angeles 
during  vacancy rates continued to decline in the inland empire region of los angeles  a large industrial area within los angeles 
the decline in vacancy rates has also led to an improvement in lease rates within the inland empire 
the decline in vacancy rates and improved pricing led developers to increase inventory within the inland empire through spec building programs in late as lease rates increase in the inland empire we may begin to have pricing advantages due to our lower land basis 
we expect the commercial industrial segment to continue to experience costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of development is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the market 
infrastructure development and marketing activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial and industrial properties 
real estate resort residential the resort residential segment reported revenues were  during compared to  during the period reflects the sale of five conservation easements covering approximately  acres for  to the tejon ranch conservancy 
resort residential segment expenses increased  during compared to primarily due to a  increase in crop cultural costs at centennial and a  increase in compensation mainly due to higher bonuses and benefit costs 
additionally  professional services increased  due to costs related to the entitlement approval of tmv  the implementation of the conservation and land use agreement and water supply strategy for our development projects 
these changes in activity between and resulted in a segment loss of  for a reduction of  our resort residential segment profits increased  to  during when compared to the increase is primarily due to the sale of five conservation easements covering approximately  acres for  to the tejon ranch conservancy  an independent non profit organization set up as a part of the conservation and land use agreement by the conservation groups that signed the agreement 
the company retained fee ownership of the  acres and continue to operate current revenue generating activities including farming  cattle grazing  filming  oil and gas and other mineral exploration and production on portions of the acreage 
the conservation easements will preclude the company from pursuing any long term development on the  acres 
funds for the easement purchase were provided by a grant from the california wildlife conservation board 
our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement activities related to our potential residential developments  which include the centennial master planned community and tmv 
each of our resort residential projects is being developed through a joint venture 
the intent of such joint venture agreements is to provide a source of capital and allow the significant costs and business risks inherent in these projects to be shared with our venture partners 
we expect near term activities within this segment to be focused on obtaining entitlements for the centennial project  located in los angeles county  defending the legal challenges to tmv  performing work necessary to receive final permits for tmv  beginning the land planning and entitlement process within the grapevine development area  and ranch wide stewardship activities 
the resort residential segment will continue to incur costs in the future related to professional service fees  public relations costs  and staffing costs as we continue forward with entitlement and permitting activities for the above communities and continue to meet our obligations under the conservation agreement 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and the possibility of litigation upon approval of our entitlements in the future 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best use for our land holdings 
our long term goal through this process is to increase the value of our land and create future revenue opportunities through resort and residential development 
since we are in the process of achieving entitlements for our centennial community  we do not have a fully approved project and therefore we do not have inventory for sale in the current market 
we received entitlement approval for our tmv community during and affirmation of these approvals in november from the kern county superior court 
on april   the california fifth district court of appeal upheld the kern county superior court affirmation of entitlement approvals 
recent economic results and other national data have indicated that the overall demand for new homes has improved from the prior year 
however  national new home sales remain below historical levels due to the current weak us economic conditions  the restrictive mortgage lending environment and variations in local housing market conditions 
until there is a more robust us economic recovery  we expect demand for new homes to remain at historically low levels  with growth very dependent on regional activity 
we are continuously monitoring the markets in order to identify the appropriate time in the future to begin infrastructure improvements and lot sales 
our long term business plan of developing the communities of centennial and tmv remains unchanged 
as the economy improves we believe the perception of land values will also begin to improve and the long term fundamentals that support housing demand in our region  primarily california population growth and household formation will also improve 
within our centennial joint venture  our partners are pardee homes  lewis investment company and standard pacific corp 
we have stated in past filings that the centennial joint venture operating agreement was amended in august to allow our partners to become non funding members during the entitlement phase of the project while we continue as the sole funding partner 
during this period any non funding partner s percentage ownership interest will be diluted by a to ratio with regard to the amount of capital contributed on such partner s behalf 
consequently  the operating results of centennial founders  llc were consolidated effective july  despite this change  our partners continue to be involved in an advisory capacity and may re elect contributing status at a later time 
at december  we have a ownership position in centennial founders  llc 
see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
mineral resources we view the mineral resources segment as an area of future growth for the company as we continue to work with and encourage our tenants to increase exploration and production activity 
revenues from our mineral resources segment increased  or  to  during compared to  primarily due to a  increase in oil royalty revenues due to a increase in oil production while the average price per barrel remained relatively unchanged at approximately oil exploration lease revenue increased  as a result of a full year of revenue recognition related to a  agreement signed in mid oil and gas production numbers and average pricing for the last three years is as follows for the year oil production barrels average price per barrel natural gas production millions of cubic feet average price per thousand cubic feet please refer to item  business mineral resources for additional information regarding oil barrels per day production 
in  we continued to see an increase in oil exploration activities on our lands due largely to the price for oil during the year 
we anticipate that this increase in production activity will continue into based on discussions with tenants as well as current and anticipated oil prices 
the increase in activity and the speed of that increase will be dependent on oil prices and the length of time necessary to receive drilling permits within california 
since we only receive royalties based on tenant production and market prices and do not produce oil  we do not have information as to the potential size of oil reserves 
our royalty revenues are contractually defined and based on a percentage of production and are received in cash 
royalty revenues fluctuate based on changes in market price for oil  gas  rock and aggregate  and portland cement 
in addition  royalty revenue is impacted by new production  the inevitable decline in production in existing wells and rock and limestone quarries  and the cost of development and production 
revenues from mineral resources segment increased  or  during compared to  mainly due to a  increase in oil royalties  a  increase in oil exploration lease revenue and  increase in cement  sand and rock royalties 
oil prices averaged per barrel based on kern county crude oil prices during compared to per barrel in production increased by  barrels when compared to farming farming revenues increased  during compared to primarily due to an increase of  in pistachio revenue 
there was a carry forward of the pistachio crop year inventory into  the sale of which increased revenues  in contrast to no inventory carry forward in from the pistachio crop 
pounds sold increased and average price per pound  including price adjustments  increased during compared to almond revenues increased  during compared to  primarily due to a increase in the average price per pound  partially offset by a decrease in pounds sold 
these increases were partially offset by an  decrease in winegrape revenues primarily due to a decline in production as the number of acres of the french colombard variety was reduced because of the age of the vines  while prices remained flat at approximately a ton 
in addition  we had a net loss of  due to the removal of older french colombard grapes 
farming expense increased  or during compared to  primarily due to a  net increase in cost of crop sales  partially offset by  decrease in water costs 
the  increase in cost of sales includes a  increase in pistachio cost of sales  partially offset by a  decrease in winegrape cost of sales 
during  we began a crop maintenance replanting program with the removal of older grape vines covering approximately acres 
we began the redevelopment of that acreage in and expect to be complete in the acres are being replanted with zinfandel and french colombard grapes 
first production is expected two years from completion of planting 
thus far in  the price for our crops has increased steadily due to the stable demand in us and world markets 
as the value of the dollar has remained competitive against foreign currencies  the demand for our crops remained steady and built on the growth from prior years 
the following table reflects crop revenues in thousands for the last three years by variety of product and crop year 
production of almonds and pistachios are stated in thousands of pounds and production of winegrapes is stated in thousands of tons 
average prices are stated on a per pound basis for almonds  and pistachios  and average prices are stated on a per ton basis for winegrapes 
revenue production average price revenue production average price revenue production average price almonds lbs 
current year crop prior year crops price adjustment signing bonus subtotal almonds pistachios lbs 
current year crop prior year crops price adjustment subtotal pistachios winegrapes tons current year crop price adjustment subtotal winegrapes total crop proceeds other farming revenues total farming revenues all of our crops are sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can depress prices 
with current grape production more in line with demand  we believe prices could continue to improve as they have the last two years or  at a minimum  remain at current levels 
our long term projection is that crop production  especially of almonds and pistachios will continue to increase on a statewide basis over time because of new plantings  which could negatively impact future prices if the growth in demand does not keep pace with production 
while demand for product continues to be strong and grow  any significant increase in the us dollar along with slow global economic growth could have a negative impact on the markets 
it is too early to project crop yields and what impact that may have on prices later in water delivery and water availability continues to be a long term concern within california 
any limitation of delivery of swp water and the absence of available alternatives during drought periods could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards 
while this could impact us  we believe we have sufficient water resources available to meet our requirements in please see our discussion on water in item  properties water operations 
farming segment profits improved  during when compared to the improvement was primarily due to an increase of  in almond profits  a  increase in winegrape profits  and  of lower water costs 
these increases were partially offset by  lower pistachio profits 
the increase in almond profits was due to an increase of approximately million pounds of almonds sold during  of which million are from prior year crops  which were partially offset by a slight decline in prices 
the improved winegrape profits were primarily due to a increase in price and an increase in production 
the reduced pistachio profits were primarily due to a decrease in pounds sold  while an increase in prices helped to partially offset the decline in production 
during  farming costs increased  this increase was due to higher cost of sales that is related to the increase in the number of pounds of almonds sold 
this higher cost of sales was partially offset by a  decline in fixed water costs due to the receipt of refunds tied to the final closing of the swp water year 
for further discussion of the farming operations  refer to item i business farming operations 
investment income investment income declined slightly during when compared to the decline is primarily attributable to a lower average investment balances during the year 
investment income increased  or  to  during when compared to  primarily due to an increase in average investment balances  as a result of the proceeds from the sale of the conservation easements 
the above interest income relates to our marketable securities portfolio as further disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements  marketable securities 
interest expense interest incurred during   and was   and  respectively  of which   and  respectively  was capitalized 
corporate expenses corporate general and administrative costs increased  or  during compared to the same period in  primarily due to a  increase in compensation expense because of a combination of the timing of hiring new employees  higher benefit costs  bonus accruals and a  increase in pension expense 
in addition  we had a  increase in licenses fees mainly related to information management systems and a  increase in depreciation expense related to information management systems placed in service 
these increases were partially offset by  increase in allocations of general and administrative expenses to other divisions and a  decrease in professional services primarily related to lower recruiter fees and the timing of audit services 
corporate expenses increased  during when compared to  primarily due to a  increase in stock compensation due to the reversal of  of stock compensation expense in amortization expense increased resulting from the  water contract purchase in december in  we centralized our marketing and communications efforts resulting in a  increase in marketing expenses at the corporate division with offsetting decreases in other segments  resulting in no change in company wide marketing expenses in compared to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures is an important and growing component of our commercial industrial activities and in the future through the tmv joint venture  equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures will become a significant part of our operational activity within the resort residential segment 
as we expand our current ventures and possibly add new joint ventures  such as a potential outlet center joint venture  these investments will become a growing revenue source for the company 
equity in income of our unconsolidated joint ventures increased  during compared to our ta petro joint venture generated  higher income mainly due to higher gasoline sales and improved fuel margins 
our rockefeller joint ventures generated  higher net income due to the occupancy of a building by dollar general and rental payments beginning in april equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased  to  during when compared to the increase is primarily due to a  or  increase in earnings from our ta petro joint venture as a result of a increase of non fuel margins and an increase in fuel margins 
the increase in fuel margins was mainly due to a and increase in average price per gallon for diesel and gasoline  respectively  while fuel volumes fluctuated slightly when compared to this increase from the ta petro results was partially offset by a  increase in net loss from our five west parcel joint venture  mainly due to the write off of the straight line deferred rent balance 
the write off was a result of lease renegotiations with a tenant occupying approximately of the building 
in december  we signed a lease with a new tenant  dollar general  to occupy the remaining of the building  with the intent to occupy the entire building within the next months 
dollar general began lease payments during april after tenant improvements were completed 
during the summer  dollar general began to occupy the entire  square feet of the building 
the five west parcel joint venture currently has an outstanding loan with a balance of  the note is due in and is fully secured by the building as well as guarantees from each partner 
we do not believe the bank will call on the guarantees provided 
income taxes for the twelve months ended december   the company incurred a net income tax expense of  compared to a net income tax expense of  for the twelve months ended december  these represent effective income tax rates of approximately and for the twelve months ended december  and   respectively 
the effective tax rate is impacted by the noncontrolling interest held in the centennial joint venture and the impact of depletion allowances 
during  depletion allowances increased due to higher oil and gas revenues and are the primary driver of the increase in permanent tax differences that is creating the favorable rate differences when compared to statutory rates 
as of december   our balance sheet reflects an income tax payable of for  we had net deferred tax assets of  our largest deferred tax assets were made up of temporary differences related to the capitalization of costs  pension adjustments  and stock grant expense 
deferred tax liabilities consist of depreciation  deferred gains  cost of sale allocations  and straight line rent 
due to the nature of most of our deferred tax assets  we believe they will be used in future years and an allowance is not necessary 
the company classifies interest and penalties incurred on tax payments as income tax expenses 
the company made total income tax payments of  in and  during the company received federal refunds of  and  in and  respectively 
for financial statement purposes  our effective tax rate for was after taking into consideration permanent and temporary timing differences 
our tax expense for was  during  our largest permanent tax difference was related to depletion allowances 
we had a tax payable at december  of  liquidity and capital resources cash flow and liquidity 
our financial position allows us to pursue our strategies of land entitlement  development  and conservation 
accordingly  we have established well defined priorities for our available cash  including investing in core business segments to achieve profitable future growth 
we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities  cash and investments  and short term borrowings from our bank credit facilities 
in the past  we have also issued common stock and used the proceeds for capital investment activities 
to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to make investments in our real estate segments to secure land entitlement approvals  build infrastructure for our developments  ensure adequate future water supplies  and provide funds for general land development activities 
within our farming segment  we will make investments as needed to improve efficiency and add capacity to its operations when it is profitable to do so 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of  or  from the corresponding amount at the end of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased during the first twelve months of due to property and equipment expenditures that included infrastructure development costs  investment in joint ventures  and payment of income taxes 
the following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the last three years year ended december in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities during  our operations provided  of cash primarily from  in cash distributions from our ta petro joint venture  improved operating results mainly from oil royalties and crop revenues and the add back of non cash expenses 
these increases in cash were partially offset by income tax payments  net of refunds  totaling approximately  related to the tax year and an increase in farming receivables outstanding 
during  our operations provided  of cash primarily from the positive impact of operating activities including increased oil royalties  crop sales  an oil exploration lease payment  for which revenue is being recognized over the term of the lease  and the collection of farming receivables 
during  investing activities used  of cash primarily as a result of the  in capital expenditures  described below   in contributions in our unconsolidated joint ventures of which  was contributed to tmv  partially offset by a  distribution from our five west parcel llc joint venture 
included in the  of capital expenditures during the first twelve months of was  related to centennial founders llc 
the remaining capital expenditures consisted of investments in trcc infrastructure and ordinary capital expenditures such as farm equipment replacements and crop development 
during  we invested  of cash primarily as a result of the  net investment in marketable securities   in capital expenditures  described below   in contributions in our unconsolidated joint ventures and  investment in horizon nut company  a pistachio processing company 
the above outflows are partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of conservation easements for  and  of proceeds from the sale of land 
included in the  capital expenditures during was  related to centennial founders  llc 
the remaining capital expenditures consisted of investments in trcc infrastructure and ordinary capital expenditures such as farm equipment replacements 
we also contributed  of capital to tmv and  to the five west parcel and west joint ventures 
we anticipate that our capital investment requirements could increase for when compared to these estimated investments include approximately  of infrastructure development at trcc east 
this new infrastructure  which started in late  is to support commercial retail development in the southern end of trcc east and to expand water facilities to support future new absorption 
we are also investing approximately  for the development of new grape vineyards as a part of a long term farm management program to redevelop declining orchards and vineyards to maintain and improve future farm revenues 
we expect to possibly invest up to  to begin the first phase of the land planning and entitlement process for the grapevine development area as described in item business 
we may potentially invest up to  in our various joint ventures  including centennial founders llc  and possibly a new outlet center joint venture 
our plans also include the potential investment of  in water infrastructure and water purchases during we will continue to add to our current water assets and water infrastructure as opportunities arise to help secure our ability to supply water to our real estate and farming activities and as an investment  since we believe that the cost of water in california will continue to increase 
we are also planning to invest approximately  in the replacement of operating equipment  such as farm equipment  and updates to our information technology systems 
during  financing activities used  in cash  primarily as a result of the buy back of vested stock grants for payroll taxes on issuance of restricted stock grants 
during the first twelve months of  financing activities provided  in cash  primarily as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by payroll taxes on issuance of restricted stock grants 
at december  and at the date of filing of this form k there was no outstanding balance on our line of credit 
it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations  the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects  and the beginning of development within tmv and centennial 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  the timing aspect of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
capital structure and financial condition 
at december   total capitalization at book value was  consisting of  of debt and  of equity  resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than one percent  which is unchanged when compared to the debt to total capitalization ratio at december  we have a long term revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had no outstanding balance 
at the company s option  the interest rate on this line of credit can float at over a selected libor rate or can be fixed at above libor for a fixed rate term 
during the term of this credit facility which matures in october  we can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re borrow  as necessary 
under the terms of the line of credit  we must maintain tangible net worth  defined as total equity  including noncontrolling interest  plus debt less intangible assets  not less than  and liquid assets of not less than  at december   our tangible net worth was  and liquid assets were  this line of credit is secured by a portion of our farm acreage 
the outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  is  at december  this debt is being used to provide long term financing for a building being leased to starbucks and the debt is secured by the leased building and land 
our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from current cash and marketable securities  cash flow from ongoing operations  proceeds from the sale of developed and undeveloped parcels  potential sales of assets  additional use of debt  proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through community facilities district bond debt described below under off balance sheet arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
during october  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s under the shelf registration statement  once declared effective  we may offer and sell in the future one or more offerings  common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants or any combination of the foregoing 
the shelf registration will allow for efficient and timely access to capital markets and when combined with our other potential funding sources just noted  provide us with a variety of capital funding options that can then be used and appropriately matched to the funding need 
as noted above  at december   we had  in cash and securities and as of the filing date of this form k  we have  available on credit lines to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial future investments will be required in order to develop our land assets 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we may need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  and the issuance of common stock 
we will use a combination of the above funding sources to properly match funding requirements with the assets or development project being funded 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our cash needs and our capital investment requirements as described earlier in the cash flow and liquidity discussions 
contractual cash obligations

based on this definition  the table above includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
a total of  acres of the company s land is subject to water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  or wrmwsd  requiring minimum future annual payments through the life of the contract which is  for as long as the company owns such land 
the estimated future minimum annual payments are estimated to be  before any potential credits are received  whether or not water is available or is used 
our cash contract commitments consist of contracts in various stages of completion related to infrastructure development within our industrial developments and entitlement costs related to our industrial and residential development projects 
at the present time  we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations outstanding 
our operating lease obligations are for office equipment  several vehicles  and a temporary trailer providing office space and average approximately  per month 
our financial obligations to the conservancy are prescribed in the conservation agreement 
our advances to the conservancy are dependent on the occurrence of certain events and their timing  and are therefore subject to change in amount and period 
the amounts included above are the minimum amounts we anticipate contributing through the year the obligation shown above represents eighty percent of the total required obligations under the conservation agreement for the next three years and fifty five percent thereafter 
these percentages take into consideration current and anticipated cash funding levels of the company to the tmv llc and the centennial founders  llc and the anticipated funding levels of our joint venture partners 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension and supplemental retirement plans 
payments above reflect estimates of future defined benefit plan contributions from the company to the plan trust and estimates of future payments to employees from the company that are in the serp program

we believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of floating rate interest payments and in the past have entered into interest rate swaps to manage those fluctuations 
at december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
however  ta petro  an unconsolidated joint venture of the company  had an interest rate swap agreement with respect to its long term debt to manage interest rate risk by converting floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matured in august changes in the value of the interest rate swap are reflected in other comprehensive income of the joint venture  and the company accounts for its share of the change in the interest rate swap in other comprehensive income 
market risk related to our farming inventories ultimately depends on the value of almonds  grapes  and pistachios at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with our current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk related to our farming inventories is discussed below in the section pertaining to commodity price exposure 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present our debt obligations and marketable securities and their related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  in thousands except percentage data thereafter total fair value at assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities long term debt weighted average interest rate interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  in thousands except percentage data thereafter total fair value assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities long term debt weighted average interest rate our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased slightly related to marketable securities since these balances have decreased compared to the prior year 
commodity price exposure as of december   we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
farming inventories consist of farming cultural and processing costs related to and crop production 
the farming costs inventoried are recorded at actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year 
of the  of accounts receivable outstanding at december    or  is at risk to changing prices 
of the amount at risk to changing prices   is attributable to pistachios  and  is attributable to almonds 
the comparable amount of accounts receivable at risk to price changes at december  was  or of the total accounts receivable of  of the december  amount at risk to changing prices   was related to pistachios and  was related to almonds 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable for pistachios recorded at december  was per pound  as compared to per pound at december  for each 
change in the price of pistachios  our receivable for pistachios increases or decreases by  although the final price of pistachios and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years prices have ranged from to 
with respect to almonds  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  as compared to per pound at december  for each change in the price of almonds  our receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  the range of final prices over the last three years for almonds has ranged from to per pound
