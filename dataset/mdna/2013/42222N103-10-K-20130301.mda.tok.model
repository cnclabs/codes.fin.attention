competition in addition to the competing healthcare education delivery methods in the industry  we also have direct competitors 
in the learning and talent management business  a number of companies offer competitive learning management products and talent management modules to the healthcare industry 
we compete with companies such as cornerstone ondemand  healthcare source  oracle  saba  sap  and sumtotal systems that provide their services to multiple industries  including healthcare 
during sap and oracle gained greater presence in this market by way of acquisitions  sap acquired successfactors and oracle acquired taleo 
we also compete with large medical publishers that have operating units that offer learning management systems that focus on healthcare  such as reed elsevier group s mc strategies 
in the survey business  we see competition from large nationally recognized survey research firms such as avatar international  gallup  national research corporation  press ganey associates  professional research consultants  inc  and others 
our survey business also experiences direct competition from vendors who provide survey research services to other industries including kenexa  which is now owned by ibm  and foresight  which is now owned by tns global 
finally  in our simulation business  we compete with b line medical  cae meti  and ems 
we believe our learning and talent management solutions  which include both products and services that facilitate training  assessment and development for healthcare professionals  a wide assortment of courseware  a mechanism for measuring satisfaction and or other results  and the ability to provide all our services on a single platform over the internet  provide us with a competitive advantage 
in our survey research business  we believe our large proprietary database of survey results  technology infrastructure designed to automate the processing of survey results  proprietary core survey instruments and action plan development methodology  and our ability to quickly deliver relevant online courseware targeted at addressing survey related findings provide us with a competitive advantage 
in our simulation business  our simcenter tm products enable simulation centers to purchase courseware online  manage students and resources  and provide a debriefing capability in an integrated manner 
built on the hlc platform and with our collaborative arrangement with laerdal medical  a world leader in simulation equipment  we believe we have a competitive advantage in this area 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the marketing of our learning  talent management  and research solutions to the healthcare industry include features of the hlc product  including reporting  management functionality  ability to manage a variety of events or modalities  courseware assignment  curriculum management  scalability  and the ability to track utilization and results  scope and variety of internet based learning courseware available  including mandated content for osha  the joint commission  patient safety  and hipaa requirements  competency based content  courseware scenarios that drive simulators  courseware that provides cpr certification  as well as the ability of our customers to create and host their own web enabled courseware  our singular focus on the healthcare industry and our deep healthcare expertise  scope and quality of professional services offered  including survey execution  implementation  benchmarking  training and the expertise and technical knowledge of the customers employees  competitive pricing  which supports a return on investment to customers when compared to other alternative delivery methods  customer service and support  effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts  and company reputation 
collectively  we believe these capabilities provide us with the ability to improve the quality of healthcare by assessing and developing the people who deliver care 
government regulation of the internet and the healthcare industry regulation of the internet and the privacy and security of personal information the laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly 
for example  the united states government and the governments of some states and foreign countries have attempted to regulate activities on the internet 
the following are some of the evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business privacy and security laws 
current and proposed federal  state and foreign privacy and security regulations and other laws restricting the collection  use  security and disclosure of personal information could limit our ability to collect information or use and disclose the information in our databases or derived from other sources to generate revenues 
it may be costly to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation 
for example  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra expanded the application of certain hipaa privacy and 
table of contents security requirements to apply directly to us as a business associate of our customers 
on january   the united states department of health and human services hhs issued implementing regulations  and we may incur substantial costs to comply with these regulations 
compliance is generally required by september  content regulation 
both foreign and domestic governments have adopted and proposed laws governing the content of material transmitted over the internet 
these include laws relating to obscenity  indecency  libel and defamation 
we could be liable if content delivered by us violates these regulations 
information security accountability regulation 
as a business associate of our customers  we are required to report certain breaches of protected health information to our customers  which must in turn notify affected individuals  hhs and  in certain situations involving large breaches  the media 
hhs recently issued regulations that create a presumption that all non permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured  protected health information are breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised 
in addition  we are subject to certain state laws that relate to privacy or the reporting of security breaches 
for example  california has enacted legislation requiring disclosure of security breaches involving personal information and medical information 
we may incur costs to comply with these security requirements 
because many of these laws are new and there is little guidance related to many of these laws  it is difficult to estimate the cost of our compliance with these laws 
further  congress has considered bills that would require companies to engage independent third parties to audit the companies computer information security 
if the company is required to report a breach of security or if one of the company s customers is required to report a breach of security by the company  the company s business could be negatively impacted 
sales and use tax 
through december   we collected sales  use or other taxes on taxable transactions in all states in which we have employees or have a significant level of sales activity 
while healthstream expects that this approach is appropriate  other states or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose tax collection obligations on companies like us that engage in online commerce 
if they do  these obligations could limit the growth of electronic commerce in general and limit our ability to profit from the sale of our services over the internet 
laws and regulations directly applicable to content regulation  e commerce  internet communications  and the privacy and security of personal information are becoming more prevalent 
congress continues considering laws regarding internet taxation 
the dynamic nature of this regulatory environment increases the uncertainty regarding the marketplace impact of such regulation 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may increase our cost of conducting business or otherwise harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
regulation of education  training and other services for healthcare professionals occupational safety and health administration osha 
osha regulations require employers to provide training to employees to minimize the risk of injury from various potential workplace hazards 
employers in the healthcare industry are required to provide training with respect to various topics  including blood borne pathogens exposure control  laboratory safety and tuberculosis infection control 
osha regulations require employers to keep records of their employees completion of training with respect to these workplace hazards 
the joint commission 
the joint commission mandates that employers in the healthcare industry provide certain workplace safety and patient interaction training to employees 
training required by the joint commission may include programs on infection control  patient bill of rights  radiation safety  and incident reporting 
healthcare organizations are required to provide and document training on these topics to receive accreditation from the joint commission 
in addition  the joint commission imposes continuing education requirements on physicians that relate to each physician s specific staff appointments 
health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 
hipaa regulations require certain organizations  including most healthcare providers and health plans  to adopt safeguards regarding the use and disclosure of health related information 
hipaa regulations also require these organizations to provide reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy  integrity and confidentiality of individually identifiable healthcare information 
these healthcare organizations are required to establish  maintain and provide training with regard to their policies and procedures for protecting the integrity and confidentiality of individually identifiable healthcare information 
healthcare organizations are required to document training on these topics to support their compliance 
arra expanded the application of certain hipaa privacy and security requirements to apply directly to companies known as business associates that provide services to certain healthcare organizations 
under the regulations that implement these arra requirements  business associates and their subcontractors may be directly subject to criminal and civil sanctions for violations of hipaa privacy security standards

the pathway to excellence program recognizes the essential elements of an optimal nursing practice environment 
the designation is earned by healthcare organizations that create work environments where nurses can flourish 
the award substantiates the professional satisfaction of nurses and identifies best places to work 
continuing nursing education cne 
state nurse practice laws are usually the source of authority for establishing the state board of nursing requirements 
the state board of nursing establishes the state s cne requirements for professional nurses 
cne credits are provided through accredited providers that have been approved by the ancc commission on accreditation and or the state board of nursing 
cne requirements vary widely from state to state 
thirty two states require registered nurses to certify that they have accumulated a minimum number of cne credits in order to maintain their licenses 
in some states  the cne requirement only applies to re licensure of advance practice nurses  or additional cnes may be required of this category of nurses 
required cne ranges from to credits annually  with reporting generally on a bi annual basis 
board certifications eg  cnor certification of perioperative nursing also require cne credits  with certain percentages required in specific categories based on the certification type 
we are an accredited provider of cne by the ancc 
continuing medical education cme 
state licensing boards  professional organizations and employers require physicians to certify that they have accumulated a minimum number of continuing medical education hours to maintain their licenses 
generally  each state s medical practice laws authorize the state s board of medicine to establish and track cme requirements 
forty eight state medical licensing boards currently have cme requirements  as well as puerto rico  guam  and the us virgin islands 
the number of cme hours required by each state ranges from to hours per year 
other sources of cme requirements are state medical societies and practice specialty boards 
the failure to obtain the requisite amount and type of cme could result in non renewal of the physician s license to practice medicine and or membership in a medical or practice specialty society 
the american medical association s ama physician recognition award certificate pra is widely accepted as proof of participation in cme 
the ama classifies continuing medical education activities as either category  which includes formal cme activities  or category  which includes most informal activities 
sponsors want to designate cme activities for ama pra category credit because this has become the benchmark for quality in formally organized educational activities 
most agencies nationwide that require cme participation specify ama pra category credit 
only institutions and organizations accredited to provide cme can designate an activity for ama pra category credit 
the accreditation council for continuing medical education accme is responsible for awarding accreditation status to state medical societies  medical schools  and other institutions and organizations that provide cme activities for a national audience of physicians 
only institutions and organizations are accredited 
the accme and state medical societies do not accredit or approve individual activities 
state medical societies  operating under the aegis of the accme  accredit institutions and organizations that provide cme activities primarily for physicians within the state or bordering states 
we are an accredited provider of cme by the accme 
centers for medicare medicaid services cms 
cms has articulated a vision for health care quality the right care for every person every time 
to achieve this vision  cms is committed to care that is safe  effective  timely  patient centered  efficient  and equitable 
value based purchasing vbp  which links payment more directly to the quality of care provided  is a strategy that can help to transform the current payment system by rewarding providers for delivering high quality  efficient clinical care 
through a number of public reporting programs  demonstration projects  pilot programs  and voluntary efforts  cms has launched vbp initiatives in hospitals  physician offices  nursing homes  home health services  and dialysis facilities 
further  pursuant to the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the healthcare and education reconciliation act of collectively  aca  cms is implementing a number of initiatives designed to link payments to quality and efficiency  including a vbp program for inpatient hospital services 
consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems cahps 
cms has partnered with ahrq to develop a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients perspectives on hospital care 
the intent of the survey is to produce comparable data on the patients perspectives to allow consumer based comparisons between hospitals  align incentives to drive hospitals to improve their quality of care  and increase the transparency of hospital reporting 
hospitals must submit data for certain required quality measures which for inpatients includes the cahps hospital survey in order to receive the full market basket increase to their reimbursement payment rates from cms 
while hospital participation is voluntary  hospitals that fail to submit this survey data will incur a reduction of two percentage points in the inpatient market basket update amount for the following federal fiscal year 
we have received certified vendor designation and will continue to offer cahps hospital survey services 
in addition  we are a certified vendor approved to offer cahps home health care survey used to measure the experiences of people receiving home health care from medicare certified home health agencies 
we also offer cahps clinician and group survey used to measure patient experiences with health care providers and staff in doctor s offices 

table of contents medicare and medicaid electronic health records ehr incentive programs 
the medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs provide incentive payments to eligible professionals  eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals cahs as they adopt  implement  upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified ehr technology 
by putting into action and meaningfully using an ehr system  providers will reap benefits beyond financial incentives such as reduction in errors  availability of records and data  reminders and alerts  clinical decision support  and e prescribing refill automation 
allied disciplines 
various allied health professionals are required to obtain continuing education to maintain their licenses 
for example  emergency medical services personnel may be required to acquire up to continuing education hours per year  all or a portion of which can be fulfilled online 
these requirements vary by state and depend on the classification of the employee 
other continuing education

regulation of educational program sponsorship and support the office of inspector general oig issued compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers in april and issued compliance program guidance for the durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics  and supply industry in july collectively  the guidelines 
these documents include guidelines related to continuing educational activities supported by pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
the guidelines already have and may continue to affect the type and extent of commercial support we receive for our continuing education activities 
the trade associations for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries phrma and advamed  respectively have also promulgated their own codes of ethics 
in january  the phrma code of ethics was updated  and advamed made changes to its code of ethics that became effective in july these changes placed further restrictions on the interactions between industry and health care professionals 
the ama has established its own code of ethics regarding gifts to physicians from industry to provide standards of conduct for the medical profession 
the company follows the rules and guidelines provided by accme  ancc  and other continuing education accrediting bodies to ensure that its continuing education programming is free from commercial bias and consistent with the guidelines 
in march  aca became law 
aca requires manufacturers of drugs  biological devices and medical supplies covered by medicare  medicaid  or the children s health insurance program to annually report to hhs payments or transfers of value  including educational programs  given by such manufacturers to physicians and teaching hospitals  with limited exceptions 
on february   cms issued a final rule implementing this provision of aca

manufacturers subject to the rule are required to begin collecting information beginning august   with the first reporting deadline set for march  cms will release the reported data on a public website by september  manufacturers that do not meet the reporting obligations will be subject to significant monetary penalties 
the us food and drug administration fda and the federal trade commission ftc current fda and ftc rules and enforcement actions and regulatory policies or those that the fda or the ftc may develop in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide existing or future applications or services to our end users or obtain the necessary corporate sponsorship to do so 
the fda and the ftc regulate the form  content and dissemination of labeling  advertising and promotional materials  including direct to consumer prescription drug and medical device advertising  prepared by  or for  pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device companies 
the ftc regulates over the counter drug advertising and  in some cases  medical device advertising 
generally  regulated companies must limit their advertising and promotional materials to discussions of the fda approved claims and  in limited circumstances  to a limited number of claims not approved by the fda 
therefore  any information that promotes the use of pharmaceutical or medical device products that is presented with our services is subject to the full array of the fda and ftc requirements and enforcement actions 
we believe that banner advertisements  sponsorship links and any educational programs that lack independent editorial control that we may present with our services could be subject to fda or ftc regulation 
while the fda and the ftc place the principal burden of compliance with advertising and promotional regulations on the advertiser  if the fda or ftc finds that any regulated information presented with our services violates fda or ftc regulations  they may take regulatory action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information 
in addition  the fda may adopt new regulatory policies that more tightly regulate the format and content of promotional information on the internet 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights to protect our proprietary rights  we rely generally on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and procedures with employees  consultants and other third parties  license agreements with consultants  vendors and customers  and use reasonable measures designed to control access to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
we own federal trademark and service mark registrations for the marks healthstream  hospital direct  or protocol  insight into action  quality check  simcenter and simstore 
we also have obtained registration of the healthstream mark in certain other countries 
applications for several trademarks are currently pending 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining registration of other trademarks for which we have applied 

table of contents the courseware that we license to our customers is developed through a combination of license agreements with publishers and authors  assignments and work for hire arrangements with third parties  and development by employees 
we require publishers  authors and other third parties to represent and warrant that their content does not infringe on or misappropriate any third party intellectual property rights and that they have the right to provide their content and have obtained all third party consents necessary to do so 
our publishers  authors and other third parties also agree to indemnify us against certain liability we might sustain due to the content they provide 
if a third party asserts a claim that we have infringed its patents or other intellectual property  we may be required to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  we license technologies from third parties for incorporation into our services 
royalty and licensing agreements with these third parties may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
additionally  the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequate 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property 
competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products or services 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately  our competitors could offer similar services  potentially significantly harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues

item a 
risk factors we believe that the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this document are the principal material risks facing the company as of the date of this report 
in the future  we may become subject to additional risks that are not currently known to us 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks and by any unknown risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the following risks or any unknown risks 
risks related to our business model we may be unable to effectively execute our growth strategy which could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position in the industry 
our business strategy includes increasing our market share and presence through sales to new customers  additional sales to existing customers  introductions of new products and services  and maintaining strong relationships with our existing customers 
some of the risks that we may encounter in executing our growth strategy include expenses  delays and difficulties of identifying and developing new products or services and integrating such new products or services into our existing organization  inability to leverage our operational and financial systems sufficiently to support our growth  inability to generate sufficient revenue from new products to offset investment costs  inability to effectively identify  manage and exploit existing and emerging market opportunities  inability to maintain our existing customer relationships  increased competition from new and existing competitors  lengthy sales cycles  or customers delaying purchasing decisions due to economic conditions  reduced spending within the training  information and education departments of hospitals within our target market  and failure of the market for training  information and education in the healthcare industry to grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate 
if any of these risks are realized  our business  and our competitive position in the industry  could suffer 
we may be unable to effectively identify  complete or integrate the operations of future acquisitions  joint ventures  collaborative arrangements or other growth investments 
as part of our growth strategy  we actively review possible acquisitions  joint ventures  collaborative arrangements or growth investments that complement or enhance our business 
we may not be able to identify  complete or integrate the operations of future acquisitions  joint ventures  collaborative arrangements or other growth investments 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions  joint ventures  collaborative arrangements or other growth initiatives by issuing equity securities  our existing shareholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock 
as a result  if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions and investments  our business prospects may be seriously harmed 
some of the risks that we may encounter in implementing our acquisition  joint venture  collaborative arrangement or growth investment strategies include expenses  delays or difficulties in identifying and integrating acquired companies or joint venture operations  collaborative arrangements or other growth investments into our organization  inability to retain personnel associated with acquisitions  joint ventures  collaborative arrangements or other growth investments  diversion of management s attention from other initiatives and or day to day operations to effectively execute our growth strategy  and inability to generate sufficient revenue  profit  and cash flow from acquisitions  joint ventures  collaborative arrangements or other growth investments to offset our investment costs 

table of contents our ability to accurately forecast revenue for certain products and services may be hindered by customer scheduling 
as revenues from our subscription business continue to increase  a larger portion of our revenues will be predictable  however  quarterly performance may be more subject to fluctuations 
our healthstream research products and services are typically contracted by healthcare organizations for multi year terms  but the frequency  sample size  and timing of survey cycles can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the contract structure for some research products gives customers latitude about when to initiate a survey  which can affect quarterly or annual revenue forecasts 
also  other project based products  such as certain content development  and professional services  are subject to the customers involvement in the provision of the product or service 
the timing and magnitude of these project based product and service contracts may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year  and thus may affect our ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual financial performance 
our ability to accurately forecast revenue may be affected by lengthy and widely varying sales cycles 
the period from our initial contact with a potential customer and their first purchase of our solution typically ranges from three to nine months  and in some cases has extended much further 
the range in the sales cycle can be impacted by multiple factors  including an increasing trend towards more formal request for proposal processes and more competition within our industry  as well as formal budget timelines which impact timing of purchases by target customers 
new products tend to have a longer and more unpredictable revenue ramp period 
as a result of these factors  we have only limited ability to forecast the timing and type of initial sales 
this  in turn  makes it more difficult to forecast quarterly and annual financial performance 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  or other resources 
several of our competitors and many potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  or other resources than we do 
we encounter direct competition from both large and small e learning companies and other companies focused on training and talent management in the healthcare industry 
we also face competition from larger survey and research companies 
given the profile and growth of the healthcare industry and the growing need for education  training  simulation  research  and information  it is likely that additional competitors will emerge 
we believe we maintain a competitive advantage against our competitors by offering a comprehensive array of products and services  however  our lack of market diversification resulting from our concentration on the healthcare industry may make us susceptible to losing market share to our competitors who also offer a complete e learning solution to a cross section of industries 
these companies may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
further  most of our customer agreements are for terms ranging from one to four or five years  with no obligation to renew 
the short terms of these agreements may enable customers to more easily shift to one of our competitors 
the failure to maintain and strengthen our relationships with strategic partners or significant changes in the terms of the agreements we have with them may have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully market our products and services 
we have entered into contracts with other companies  including content  technology  and retail channel vendors 
our ability to increase the sales of our products and services depends in part upon maintaining and strengthening relationships with these current and future strategic partners 
most of these contracts are on a non exclusive basis 
certain strategic partners may offer products and services from multiple distinct companies  including  in some instances  products or services which may compete with our products and services 
moreover  under contracts with some of our strategic partners  we may be bound by provisions that restrict our ability to market and sell our products and services to certain potential customers 
the success of these contractual arrangements will depend in part upon the strategic partners own competitive  marketing  and strategic considerations  including the relative advantages of using alternative products being developed and marketed by them or our competitors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain and strengthen our relationships with strategic partners  that we will be successful in effectively integrating such partners products and technology into our own  or that such relationships will be successful in generating additional revenue 
if any of these strategic partners are unsuccessful in their involvement with our products and services  or seek to amend the financial or other terms of the contracts we have with them  we will need to broaden our efforts to increase focus on the types of services and solutions they sell and alter our development  integration  and or distribution strategies  which may divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects 
lastly  we could be subject to claims and liability  as a result of the activities  products  or services of these strategic partners 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending these claims could be expensive  time consuming and result in suspension of certain offerings to our clients and or adverse publicity that could harm our business 
we may not be able to retain proper distribution rights from our content partners  and this could affect projected growth in courseware subscription revenue 
most of our agreements with content providers are for initial terms of two to three years 
the content partners may choose not to renew their agreements with us or may terminate the agreements early if we do not fulfill our contractual obligations 
if a significant number of our content providers terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us on acceptable terms  it could result in a reduction in the number of courses we are able to distribute  causing decreased revenues 
most of our agreements with our content partners are 
table of contents non exclusive  and our competitors offer  or could offer  training and continuing education content that is similar to or the same as ours 
if publishers and authors  including our current content partners  offer information to users or our competitors on more favorable terms than those offered to us  or increase our license fees  our competitive position and our profit margins and prospects could be harmed 
in addition  the failure by our content partners to deliver high quality content and to revise their content in response to user demand and evolving healthcare advances and trends could result in customer dissatisfaction and inhibit our ability to attract and retain subscribers of our courseware offerings 
we may not be able to develop new products and services  or enhancements to our existing products and services  or be able to achieve widespread acceptance of new products  services or features  or keep pace with technological developments 
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to generate revenue growth through sales to new customers as well as increasing sales of additional courseware subscriptions and other products and services to existing customers 
our identification of additional features  content  products and services may not result in timely development of complementary products 
in addition  the success of certain new products and services may be dependent on continued growth in our base of internet based customers and we are not able to accurately predict the volume or speed with which old and new customers will adopt such new products and services 
because healthcare training continues to change and evolve  we may be unable to accurately predict and develop new products  features  content and other products to address the needs of the healthcare industry 
further  the new products  services and enhancements we develop may introduce significant defects into or otherwise negatively impact our core software platforms 
while all new products and services are subject to testing and quality control  all software and software based services are subject to errors and malfunctions 
if we release new products  services and or enhancements with bugs  defects or errors or that cause bugs  defects or errors in existing products  it could result in lost revenues  reduced ability to meet contractual obligations and would be detrimental to our business and reputation 
if new products  features  or content are not accepted or integrated by new or existing customers  we may not be able to recover the cost of this development and our financial performance will be harmed 
continued growth of our internet based customer population is dependent on our ability to continue to provide relevant products and services in a timely manner 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to continue providing our products and services as well as enhancing our courseware  product and service offerings that address the needs of healthcare organizations 
we may be unable to continue to license our third party software  on which a portion of our product and service offerings rely  or we may experience errors in this software  which could increase our costs and decrease our revenue 
we use technology components in some of our products that have been licensed from third parties 
future licenses to these technologies may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of or inability to obtain or maintain any of these licenses could result in delays in the introduction of new products and services or could force us to discontinue offering portions of our learning management or survey and research solutions until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in third party technology or content that we incorporate  and we may incur additional costs to repair or replace the defective technology or content 
it may be difficult for us to correct any errors in third party products because the products are not within our control 
accordingly  our revenue could decrease and our costs could increase in the event of any errors in this technology 
furthermore  we may become subject to legal claims related to licensed technology based on product liability  infringement of intellectual property or other legal theories 
financial risks a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a relatively small number of customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers 
a termination of our agreements with any of our significant customers or a failure of these customers to renew their contracts on favorable terms  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our business is subject to renewal each year 
therefore  renewals have a significant impact on our revenue and operating results 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue was derived from our internet based subscription products 
our internet based hlc customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our products or services after the expiration of the subscription agreement  and in fact  some customers have elected not to renew their subscription 
in addition  our customers may renew at a lower pricing or activity level 
during the year ended december   we renewed of the annual hlc contract value up for renewal and of the subscribers which were up for renewal 
our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to their dissatisfaction with our service  pricing or competitive product offerings 
if we are unable to renew a substantial portion of the contracts that are up for renewal or maintain our pricing  our revenue could be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position 
healthstream research product and service contracts typically range from one to three years in length  and customers are not obligated to renew their contract with us after their contract expires 
if our customers do not renew their arrangements for our services  or if their activity levels decline  our revenue may decline and our business will suffer 

table of contents we may be unable to accurately predict the timing of revenue recognition from sales activity as it is often dependent on achieving certain events or performance milestones  and this inability could impact our operating results 
our ability to recognize revenue is dependent upon several factors including the transfer of customer specific information such as unique subscriber ids  which are required for us to implement customers on our internet based learning and talent management platform 
accordingly  if customers do not provide us with the specified information in a timely manner  our ability to recognize revenue will be delayed  which could adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  completion and acceptance by our customers of developed content and courseware must be achieved  survey responses must be received and tabulated  and utilization of courseware is required in connection with subscription internet based learning and talent management products for us to recognize revenue 
because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our products and services over the term of the subscription period  downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 
we recognize approximately of our revenue from customers monthly over the terms of their subscription agreements  which have initial contract terms ranging from one to four or five years 
as a result  much of the revenue we report in each quarter is related to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters 
consequently  a decline in new or renewed subscription agreements in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect this reduced revenue 
accordingly  the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products and services may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods 
additionally  our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period  as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 
finally  the majority of costs associated with our sales cycles are incurred up front before revenue recognition commences  and therefore periods of strong sales performance may increase our costs in the near term negatively affecting our financial performance 
we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives unless we obtain additional financing  which may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
we expect our current cash and investment reserves  revolving credit facility  and cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to develop new  or enhance existing  services or products  respond to competitive pressures  finance working capital requirements  acquire complementary businesses  technology  content or products  or otherwise effectively execute our growth strategy 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we also have up to million of availability under a revolving credit facility  subject to certain covenants  which expires in july we expect to incur between and million of capital expenditures  software development and content purchases during we continue to actively review possible business acquisitions that would complement or enhance our products and services 
we may not have adequate cash and investments or availability under our revolving credit facility to consummate one or more of these acquisitions 
the capital markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption  and we cannot assure you that if we need additional financing that it will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund expansion  take advantage of available opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be reduced 
we have significant goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet that may be subject to impairment losses that would reduce our reported assets and earnings 
as of december   our balance sheet included goodwill of million and identifiable intangible assets of million 
there are inherent uncertainties in the estimates  judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 
economic  legal  regulatory  competitive  reputational  contractual  and other factors could result in future declines in the operating results of our business units or market value declines that do not support the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
if the value of our goodwill and or intangible assets is impaired  accounting rules require us to reduce their carrying value and report an impairment charge  which would reduce our reported assets and earnings for the period in which an impairment is recognized 

table of contents the current uncertain economic environment may have a negative impact on our customers and us which could have a significant impact on our revenue  operating results and financial condition 
it is difficult to predict the full magnitude and duration of the current uncertain economic environment and its related impact on our customers  suppliers and our company 
for example  our customers may experience fluctuations or declines in their business and as a consequence  some customers may choose to invest less in information technology assets for their business which  in turn  could have an impact on us 
the potential negative effects on us include  but are not limited to  reductions in our renewal and revenue growth rates  shorter contract terms  pricing pressures  and delays in payments from customers that increase our accounts receivable resulting in a deterioration of our cash flow and working capital position 
we continue to monitor general economic conditions  however  and depending on the severity and or duration of any economic downturn  these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results from operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to demonstrate compliance with sarbanes oxley section in a timely manner  and the correction of any deficiencies identified during upcoming annual audits may be costly and could harm our business 
sarbanes oxley section requires our management to report on  and requires our independent public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
the rules governing the standards to be met are complex and will require significant process review  documentation and testing  as well as possible remediation efforts for any identified deficiencies 
this process of review  documentation  testing and remediation will result in increased expenses and require significant attention from management and other internal and external resources 
any material weaknesses identified during this process may preclude us from asserting the effectiveness of our internal controls 
this may negatively affect our stock price if we cannot effectively remediate the issues identified in a timely manner 
changes in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and other accounting regulations and interpretations could require us to delay recognition of revenue and or accelerate the recognition of expenses  resulting in lower earnings 
while we believe we correctly account for and recognize revenue and expenses  any changes in gaap or other accounting regulations and interpretations concerning revenue and expense recognition could decrease our revenue or increase our expenses 
changes to regulations concerning revenue recognition could require us to alter our current revenue accounting practices and cause us to either defer revenue into a future period  or to recognize lower revenue in a current period 
likewise  changes to regulations concerning expense recognition could require us to alter our current expense accounting practices and cause us to defer recognition of expense into a future period  or to recognize increased expenses in a current period 
changes to either revenue recognition or expense recognition accounting practices could affect our financial performance 
risks related to sales  marketing and competition our operating margins could be affected if our ongoing refinement to pricing models for our products and services is not accepted by our customers and the market 
over the past few years we have implemented several changes  and we continue to make changes  in our pricing and our product and service offerings to increase revenue and to meet the needs of our customers 
we cannot predict whether our current pricing and products and services  or any ongoing refinements we make will be accepted by our existing customer base or by prospective customers 
if our customers and potential customers decide not to accept our current or future pricing or product and service offerings  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to operations we may be unable to adequately develop our systems  processes and support in a manner that will enable us to meet the demand for our services 
we have provided our online products and services since and continue to develop our ability to provide our courseware  learning and talent management systems  and research systems on both a subscription and transactional basis over the internet 
our future success will depend on our ability to effectively develop and maintain the infrastructure  including procurement of additional hardware and software  and implement the services  including customer support  necessary to meet the demand for our products and services 
our inability from time to time to successfully develop the necessary systems and implement the necessary services on a timely basis has resulted in our customers experiencing some delays  interruptions and or errors in their service 
such delays or interruptions may cause customers to become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers of traditional and online training and education services 
if this happens  our revenue and reputation could be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents our business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lose members of  or fail to integrate  our management team 
our future performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our management team and our ability to retain and motivate them 
the loss of the services of any of our officers or senior managers could harm our business  as we may not be able to find suitable replacements 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel  other than our chief executive officer  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees and  as a result  we may not be able to effectively execute our growth strategy or maintain the quality of our services 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  motivate  and retain other highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  customer support  and survey personnel 
competition for certain personnel is intense  especially for developers  web designers and sales personnel  and we may be unable to successfully attract sufficiently qualified personnel 
we have in the past and continue to experience difficulty hiring qualified personnel in a timely manner for these positions 
the pool of qualified technical personnel  in particular  is limited in nashville  tennessee  where our headquarters are located 
our interviewing center is located in laurel  maryland  and we may experience difficulty in maintaining and recruiting qualified individuals to perform these services 
we will also need to maintain or increase the size of our staff to support our anticipated growth  without compromising the quality of our offerings or customer service 
our inability to locate  hire  integrate and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers may reduce the quality of our services and impair our ability to grow 
we may not be able to upgrade our hardware and software technology infrastructure quickly enough to effectively meet demand for our services 
we must continue to obtain reasonably priced  commercially available hardware and operating software as well as continue to enhance our software to accommodate the increased use of our platform and increased courseware in our library 
decisions about hardware and software enhancements are based in part on estimated forecasts of the growth in demand for our services 
this growth in demand for our services is difficult to forecast and the potential audience for our services is widespread and dynamic 
if we are unable to increase the data storage and processing capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand  our customers may encounter delays or disruptions in their service 
unscheduled downtime could harm our business and also could discourage current and potential customers from using or continuing to use our services and reduce future revenue 
our network infrastructure and computer systems and software may fail 
an unexpected event including but not limited to a telecommunications failure  fire  earthquake  or other catastrophic loss at our internet service providers facilities or at our on site data facility could cause the loss of critical data and prevent us from offering our products and services for an unknown period of time 
system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our products and services and may expose us to significant third party claims 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
in addition  we rely on third parties to securely store our archived data  house our web server and network systems and connect us to the internet 
while our service providers have planned for certain contingencies  the failure by any of these third parties to provide these services satisfactorily and our inability to find suitable replacements would impair our ability to access archives and operate our systems and software 
we may lose users and lose revenue if our security measures fail 
if the security measures that we use to protect customer or personal information are ineffective  we may lose users of our services  which could reduce our revenue  tarnish our reputation  and subject us to significant liability 
we rely on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties 
with this technology  we perform real time credit card authorization and verification  as well as the encryption of other selected secure customer data 
we cannot predict whether these security measures could be circumvented by new technological developments 
further  the audit processes and controls used within our production platforms may not be sufficient to identify and prevent errors or deliberate misuse 
in addition  our software  databases and servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic attacks and similar disruptions 
we may need to spend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
we cannot assure that we can prevent all security breaches 
we may experience errors in our software products that administer and report on hospital performance  and these errors could result in action taken against us that could harm our business 
certain survey data collected and reported by us  such as the survey data included as part of our cahps hospital survey is used by cms to determine  in part  the amount of reimbursement payments to hospitals  and any errors in data collection  survey sampling  or statistical reporting could result in reduced reimbursements to our hospital customers if we are unable to correct these errors  and this could  in turn  result in litigation against us 
further  this survey data reported to cms is then published by cms to the general public  and any errors we experience that result in incorrect scoring on our hospital customer may result in damage to that hospital s reputation  and the hospital may in turn bring litigation against us 
we may be required to indemnify against such claims  and defending against any such claims could be costly  time consuming and could negatively affect our business 

table of contents risks related to government regulation  content and intellectual property government regulation may subject us to liability or require us to change the way we do business 
the laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly 
evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business include privacy and security laws  proposed encryption laws  content regulation  information security accountability regulation  and sales and use tax laws and regulations and attempts to regulate activities on the internet 
because of this rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory environment  we cannot predict how these laws and regulations might affect our business 
these uncertainties make it difficult to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business 
these laws and regulations could harm us by subjecting us to liability or forcing us to change how we do business 
in addition  certain laws mandate that our customers contractually require us to protect the privacy and security of certain personal and health related information 
if we fail to abide by these required contractual provisions  our customers may terminate their contracts with us 
in addition  arra expanded the application of certain of the hipaa privacy and security regulations to apply directly to business associates including us 
violations of hipaa privacy and security regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties 
further  arra has increased these penalties and strengthened other enforcement provisions of hipaa  which may result in increased enforcement activity 
hhs has published a final rule that implements many of these arra provisions that become effective march  the final rule will likely require amendments to existing agreements with our customers and subcontractors by september   except that existing business associate agreements may qualify for an extended compliance date of september  we may not be able to maintain our certification to conduct cms mandated surveys  and this could adversely affect our business 
our survey product offerings include providing survey services to assist customers in their compliance with cms regulations 
we are currently designated by cms as a certified vendor to offer cahps hospital surveys and cahps home health care surveys  including data collection and submission services 
if we are unable to maintain these certifications  or secure certifications for future cms mandated surveys  we would not be able to administer these survey instruments for our customers and our business may suffer 
any reduction or change in the regulation of continuing education and training in the healthcare industry may adversely affect our business 
our business model is dependent in part on required training and continuing education for healthcare professionals and other healthcare workers resulting from regulations of state and federal agencies  state licensing boards and professional organizations 
any change in these regulations that reduce the requirements for continuing education and training for the healthcare industry could harm our business 
in addition  a portion of our business with pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and hospitals is predicated on our ability to maintain accreditation status with organizations such as the accme  ancc  and acpe 
the failure to maintain status as an accredited provider could have a detrimental effect on our business 
we may be liable to third parties for content that is available from our online library 
we may be liable to third parties for the content in our online library if the text  graphics  software or other content in our library violates copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights  our content partners violate their contractual obligations to others by providing content to our library  or the content does not conform to accepted standards of care in the healthcare profession 
we attempt to minimize these types of liabilities by requiring representations and warranties relating to our content partners ownership of the rights to distribute as well as the accuracy of their content 
we also take necessary measures to review this content ourselves 
although our agreements with our content partners in most instances contain provisions providing for indemnification by the content providers in the event of inaccurate content  our content partners may not have the financial resources to meet this obligation 
alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation  requiring us to incur legal costs in defense  exposing us to awards of damages and costs  and diverting management s attention away from our business 
protection of certain intellectual property may be difficult and costly  and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual proprietary rights  a third party could  without authorization  copy or otherwise misappropriate our content  information from our databases  or other intellectual property 
our agreements with employees  consultants and others who participate in development activities could be breached and result in our trade secrets becoming known  or our trade secrets and other intellectual property could be independently developed by competitors 
we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches or protections against such competitor developments 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in those jurisdictions 
we currently own several applications and registrations for trademarks and domain names in the united states and other countries as well as certain common law trademarks and service marks 
the current system for registering  allocating and managing domain names has been the subject of litigation and proposed regulatory reform 
additionally  legislative proposals have been made by the federal government that would afford broad protection to owners of databases of information  such as stock quotes 
this protection of databases already exists in the european union 
our business could be harmed if unauthorized parties infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property  proprietary systems  content  platform  services or other information 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through copyright  trademarks and other controls may not be adequate 
for instance  we may not be able to secure trademark or service mark registrations for marks in the united states or in foreign countries  or to secure patents for our proprietary products and services  and even if we are successful in obtaining patent and or trademark registrations  these registrations may be opposed or invalidated by a third party 
there has been substantial litigation in the computer and online industries regarding intellectual property assets  particularly patents 
third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to current and future products  trademarks or other proprietary rights  and we may counterclaim against such third parties in such actions 
any such claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in 
table of contents costly litigation  divert management s attention  cause product release delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and operating results 
such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
our competitors may develop similar intellectual property  duplicate our products and or services  or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the patents  intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties  which could be time consuming and costly and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
intellectual property infringement claims could be made against us  especially as the number of our competitors grows 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company and result in a temporary inability to use the intellectual property subject to such claim 
in addition  if we and or our affiliates and customers become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and develop comparable non infringing intellectual property  to obtain a license  or to cease providing the content or services that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing intellectual property or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all

as of december  our cash and investment balances approximated million  and we maintained full availability under our million revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from our internet based learning and talent management products and courseware subscriptions based on a per person subscription basis  and in some cases on a per license basis 
our fees are based on the size of the facilities or organizations employee user population and the service offerings to which they subscribe 
revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the underlying contract 
revenues associated with online training are recognized over the term of the subscription period or over the historical usage period  if usage typically differs from the subscription period 
all other service revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
revenues derived from the license of installed software products  associated with the sy 
med products  are recognized upon shipment or installation of the software 
software support and maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
revenues from survey and research services are recognized when survey results are delivered to customers via either internet based reporting throughout the survey period or by providing final survey results once all services are complete 
a significant portion of revenues for survey and reporting services that are provided through the use of internet based reporting methodologies are recognized using the proportional performance method  reflecting recognition throughout the service period which corresponds with the survey cycle and reporting access by the customer  which typically ranges from one to five months 
if survey results are delivered to the customer after all services have been completed  then the corresponding revenues are recognized in full in the period such results are provided to the customer 
all other revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered to the customer 
revenues for these services can be subject to seasonal factors based on customers requirements that can impact the timing  frequency  and volume of survey cycles 
revenues from professional services include content maintenance  consulting  and implementation services 
fees are based on the time and efforts involved  and revenue is recognized upon completion of performance milestones using the proportional performance method 
we offer training services for clients to facilitate integration of our internet based products 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
basic online training is generally included in the initial contract  however  incremental training is fee based and revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and our survey and research services through healthcare organizations 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based learning and talent management products will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the fees we charge for courseware resulting from this marketing is typically paid by either the employer or sponsoring organization 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured at tax rates that will be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
management periodically assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets  and to the extent that we believe a recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
the company maintains a valuation allowance of approximately million for the portion of its deferred tax assets which are related to the portion of our nols associated with deductions for stock option exercises 
software development costs software development includes our costs to develop and maintain our products and applications  including our internet based learning and talent management products and our survey reporting applications 
once planning is completed and development begins  we capitalize internal costs and payments to third parties associated with the development efforts where the life expectancy is greater than one year and the anticipated cash flows are expected to exceed the cost of the related asset 
during and  we capitalized approximately million and million  respectively  for software development 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption capitalized software development 
we amortize capitalized software development costs over their expected life  which is generally one to five years 
capitalized software development costs are subject to a periodic impairment review in accordance with our impairment review policy 

table of contents in connection with software development  our significant estimates involve the assessment of the development period for new products  as well as the expected useful life of underlying software or product created 
once capitalized  software development costs are subject to the policies and estimates described below regarding goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level by assessing whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value 
if this assessment concludes that is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then goodwill is not considered impaired and no further impairment testing is required 
conversely  if the assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  a goodwill impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company determines fair value of the reporting units using both income and market based models 
our models contain significant assumptions and accounting estimates about discount rates  future cash flows and terminal values that could materially affect our operating results or financial position if they were to change significantly in the future and could result in an impairment 
we perform our goodwill impairment assessment whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and also during the fourth quarter each year 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are also reviewed for events or changes in facts and circumstances  both internally and externally  which may indicate an impairment is present 
we measure any impairment using observable market values or discounted future cash flows from the related long lived assets 
the cash flow estimates and discount rates incorporate management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the date of evaluation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts using both a specific and non specific identification method 
management s evaluation includes reviewing past due accounts on a case by case basis  and determining whether an account should be reserved  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each potentially uncollectible account 
an allowance is also maintained for accounts not specifically identified that may become uncollectible in the future 
uncollectible accounts are written off in the period management believes it has exhausted every opportunity to collect payment from the customer 
bad debt expense is recorded when events or circumstances indicate an additional allowance is necessary based on our specific and non specific identification approach 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately  as of december  stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments including stock options 
measurement of such compensation expense requires significant estimation and assumptions  however  we believe that the black scholes option pricing model we use for calculating the fair value of our stock based compensation plans provides a reasonable measurement methodology using a framework that is widely adopted 
as of december   we have two stock incentive plans which qualified as stock based compensation plans 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded approximately million   and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
we have historically granted stock options or restricted share units to our management group on an annual basis  or when new members of the management group begin their employment 
we have historically granted stock options or restricted share units to members of our board of directors in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting  or as new members are added on a pro rata basis based on the time elapsed since our annual shareholders meeting 
we expect to continue providing equity based awards to our management group and our board of directors for the foreseeable future 
as of december   total future compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized was approximately million net of estimated forfeitures  with a weighted average expense recognition period of years 
future compensation expense recognition for new equity based award grants will vary depending on the timing and size of new awards granted  changes in the market price or volatility of our common stock  changes in risk free interest rates  or if actual forfeitures vary significantly from our estimates

see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for our reconciliation of this calculation to measures under us gaap 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures this report contains certain non gaap financial measures  including  non gaap net income  non gaap operating income  non gaap revenue and adjusted ebitda  which are used by management in analyzing the company s financial results and ongoing operational performance 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance which are prepared in accordance with us gaap and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
in order to better assess the company s financial results  management believes that adjusted ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company because adjusted ebitda reflects net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
adjusted ebitda is also used by many investors and securities analysts to assess the company s results from current operations 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under us gaap 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with us gaap  it is susceptible to varying calculations 
accordingly  adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the company understands that  although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies  this measure has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for an analysis of the company s results as reported under us gaap 
for example  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  it does not reflect non cash components of employee compensation  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  and due to the company s utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in  and  actual cash income tax payments have been significantly less than the tax provision recorded in accordance with us gaap  and income tax payments will continue to be less than the income tax provision until our existing federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have been fully utilized or have expired 
management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda through disclosure of such limitations  presentation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable us gaap measure 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  the company completed the acquisitions of dci during june and sy 
med in october in accordance with us gaap reporting requirements for fair value  we recorded a deferred revenue write down of  for dci and  for sy 
med 
these write down s will result in lower revenues than would have otherwise been recognized for such services 
in order to provide more accurate trends and comparisons of the company s revenues  operating income  and net income  management believes that adding back the deferred revenue write down associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses provides a better indication of the ongoing performance of the company 
the revenue for the acquired contracts is deferred and typically recognized over a one year period  so our us gaap revenues for the one year period after the acquisition will not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value

table of contents revenues increased and operating income improved over the prior year  and our balance sheet reflects positive working capital of million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in working capital primarily resulted from increases in cash and investment balances 
at december   the company s primary source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the company also has a million revolving credit facility loan agreement  all of which was available at december  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operations  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital  new product development  potential acquisitions and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
over the past eight years  we have utilized our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
we anticipate our remaining net operating loss carryforwards will become fully utilized over the next to months 
our actual tax payments may increase significantly once the net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized 
as part of our growth strategy  we review possible acquisitions that complement our products and services 
we anticipate that future acquisitions  if any  would be effected through a combination of stock and cash consideration 
the issuance of our stock as consideration for an acquisition could have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and could adversely affect our stock price 
because we have no material debt or outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  our balance sheet is unleveraged 
our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and availability calculations designed to set a maximum leverage ratio of outstanding debt to equity 
therefore  if we were to borrow against our revolving credit facility  our debt capacity would be dependent on the covenant values at the time of borrowing 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all covenants 
the credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption  and we cannot assure you that if we need additional financing that it will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company s off balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of operating leases  contractual obligations  and our revolving credit facility  which is described further in note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc topic  comprehensive income 
the objective of asu is to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the update requires entities to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements  and entities will no longer be allowed to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income will be presented separately on the face of the financial statements 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other  which amends asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the purpose of asu is to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
entities will assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value 
in instances where the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value  entities will perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we do not have any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
as of december   the company had no outstanding debt 
we may become subject to interest rate market risk associated with any future borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate under the revolving credit facility is based on day libor plus a margin of either or basis points determined in accordance with a pricing grid 
we are exposed to market risk with respect to our cash and investment balances  which approximated million at december  assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  interest income from cash and investments would decrease on an annualized basis by approximately  the company s investment policy and strategy is focused on investing in highly rated securities  with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
the company s policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer and sets limits on the average portfolio maturity 
the above market risk discussion and the estimated amounts presented are forward looking statements of market risk assuming the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of actual developments in the market
