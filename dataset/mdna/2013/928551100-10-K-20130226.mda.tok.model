the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 

table of contents overview vivus is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to commercializing and developing innovative therapies to address unmet needs in obesity  sleep apnea  diabetes and sexual health 
our drug  qsymia phentermine and topiramate extended release formerly known as qnexa was approved by the fda for the treatment of obesity as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index  or bmi  of or greater obese  or or greater overweight in the presence of at least one weight related comorbidity  such as hypertension  type diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol dyslipidemia 
qsymia incorporates low doses of active ingredients from two previously approved drugs  phentermine and topiramate 
qsymia is believed to target excessive appetite and a high threshold for satiety  or the feeling of being full  the two main mechanisms that impact eating behavior 
we announced the us market availability of qsymia for obesity in september on february   the chmp confirmed its october  decision to deny the maa for qsiva phentermine topiramate extended release for the treatment of obesity in the european union  or eu 
we have completed phase clinical studies for qsymia for the treatment of sleep apnea and qsymia for the treatment of type diabetes 
our drug  stendra  or avanafil  was approved by the fda for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  or ed  in the us we  through collaboration arrangements with third parties  intend to market and sell stendra in the us  and if approved  under the trade name spedra in the eu and other territories outside the us our strategy our goal is to build a successful biopharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary drugs 
we intend to achieve this by successfully commercializing qsymia in the us  entering into and supporting a collaboration agreement for the commercialization of stendra for the treatment of ed in the us  obtaining regulatory approval for spedra for the treatment of ed in the eu and other territories worldwide  and if approved  entering into and supporting collaboration agreements for the commercialization of spedra for the treatment of ed in the eu and other territories worldwide 
it is our objective to become a leader in the development and commercialization of drugs for large underserved markets 
we believe we have strong intellectual property supporting several opportunities in obesity and related disorders  such as sleep apnea and diabetes  and sexual health 
our future growth depends on our ability to further develop and obtain regulatory approval of our investigational drug candidates for indications that we have studied  or plan to study  as well as in licensing and product line extensions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to available for sale securities  research and development expenses  income taxes  inventories  contingencies and litigation and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other 
table of contents assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of qsymia when i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and title has passed  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales transactions where the customer has the right to return the product is recognized at the time of sale only if i our price to the customer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  ii the customer has paid us  or the customer is obligated to pay us and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  iii the customer obligation to us would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  iv the customer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by us  v we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the customer  and vi the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
net product revenue and product revenue allowances product revenue is recognized net of cash consideration paid to our customers  the certified pharmacies  for services rendered by the pharmacies in accordance with certified pharmacy services network agreements  and include a fixed rate per prescription shipped and monthly program management and data fees 
these services are not deemed sufficiently separable from the customers purchase of the product  therefore  they are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
other reductions of revenue include certain prompt pay discounts and allowances offered our customers which are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later of the date at which the related revenue is recognized or the date at which the allowance is offered 
calculating certain of these items involves estimates and judgments based on sales or invoice data and historical experience 
amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends  significant events  or actual results indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
revisions of estimates for sales deductions are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
qsymia was approved by the fda in july we sell qsymia product in the us only to select certified pharmacies through their home delivery pharmacy services networks  which are collectively  our customers 
under this arrangement  title and risk of loss transfer to our customers upon delivery of the product to their distribution facilities 
they in turn  sell  dispense and ship directly to patients through their home delivery service 
we shipped initial orders of qsymia to our customers in september and announced the availability of the product on september  qsymia has a month shelf life and we grant rights to our customers to return unsold product three months prior to and up to twelve months after product expiration and issue credits which may be applied against existing or future invoices 
given our limited history of selling qsymia and the lengthy return period  we have not been able to reliably estimate expected returns of qsymia at the time of shipment  and therefore we recognize revenue when units are shipped to patients through prescriptions  at which point  the product is not subject to return 
we 
table of contents obtain the prescription shipment data directly from the pharmacies to determine the amount of revenue to recognize 
we will continue to recognize revenue for qsymia based upon prescription sell through until we have sufficient historical information to reliably estimate returns 
as of december   we have recorded deferred revenue of million related to shipments of qsymia  which represents product shipped to our customers  but not yet shipped to patients through prescriptions 
a corresponding accounts receivable is also recorded for this amount  as the payments from customers are not contingent upon the sale of product to patients 
inventories and related reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method for all inventories  which are valued using a weighted average cost method calculated for each production batch 
inventory includes the cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  raw materials and third party contract manufacturing and packaging services 
indirect overhead costs associated with production and distribution are allocated to the appropriate cost pool and then absorbed into inventory based on the units produced or distributed  assuming normal capacity  in the applicable period 
inventory costs of product shipped to customers  but not yet shipped to patients through prescriptions  are recorded as deferred costs within inventories on the consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently recognized to cost of goods sold when shipped to patients through prescriptions 
our policy is to write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements 
the estimate of excess quantities is subjective and primarily dependent on our estimates of future demand for a particular product 
if the estimate of future demand is inaccurate based on actual sales  we may adjust the reserve for excess inventory for that product and record a charge to cost of goods sold 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses include license fees  related compensation  consultants fees  facilities costs  accrued milestones  administrative expenses related to r d activities and clinical trial costs incurred by clinical research organizations  or cros  and research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
we also record accruals for estimated ongoing clinical trial costs 
clinical trial costs represent costs incurred by cros and clinical sites and include advertising for clinical trials and patient recruitment costs 
these costs are recorded as a component of r d expenses and are expensed as incurred 
under our agreements  progress payments are typically made to investigators  clinical sites and cros 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in addition  the company has obtained rights to patented intellectual properties under several licensing agreements for use in research and development activities 
non refundable licensing payments made for intellectual properties that have no alternative future use are expensed to research and development as incurred 

table of contents share based payments we follow the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with in the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  compensation stock compensation  or asc under asc  the estimated fair value of share based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units granted under our stock option plans and purchases of common stock by employees at a discount to market price under our employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  is recognized as compensation expense 
compensation expense for purchases under the espp is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share based awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of judgment are the estimated lives of the share based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing the historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we determine expected volatility using the historical method  which is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock over the expected term of the option 
management selected the historical method primarily because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to predict future volatility 
for more information about our share based payments  see note stock option and purchase plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
share based compensation expense is allocated among cost of goods sold  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  or included in the inventory carrying value and absorbed into inventory  based on the function of the related employee 
as of december   unrecognized estimated compensation expense totaled  related to non vested restricted stock units  million related to non vested stock options and  related to the espp 
the weighted average remaining requisite service period of the non vested restricted stock units was years  of the non vested stock options was years and of the espp was months 
fair value measurements financial instruments measured at fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale financial instruments are carried at fair value and we make estimates regarding valuation of these assets measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement definition and hierarchy 
asc defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
valuation technique 
asc establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of vivus 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best 
table of contents information available in the circumstances 
asc prescribes three valuation techniques that shall be used to measure fair value as follows market approach uses prices or other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flow amounts to a single present value amount discounted 
cost approach the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset ie  current replacement cost 
one or a combination of the approaches above can be used to calculate fair value  whichever results in the most representative fair value 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled million 
all of our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are in cash  money market instruments and us treasury securities at december   and these are classified as level the valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of these financial instruments were derived from quoted market prices  as substantially all of these instruments have maturity dates  if any  within one year from the date of purchase and active markets for these instruments exists 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  as of december   it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would recognize a benefit to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
we record legal fees and costs as an expense when incurred 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per share during the same period in the increase in net loss is primarily attributable to increased selling  general and administrative expenses related to commercialization and pre commercialization activities for qsymia 
we may have continued losses in future periods  depending on our success in commercializing qsymia and stendra  the timing of our research and development expenditures  and our continued investment in the clinical development of our current research and investigational drug candidates  to bring those potential drugs to market 
continuing operations net product revenue net product revenue was million for the year ended december  we had no net product revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  or the following table reconciles gross revenue to net revenue for the year ended december  in thousands gross product revenue pharmacy fees cash discounts net product revenue pharmacy fees are based on information provided by the pharmacies and include fixed monthly management and data fees and fees incurred per prescription order shipped to patients by the pharmacies 
cash discounts for prompt payment are based on of gross product revenue 
we did not have any other typical gross to net items such as rebates  chargebacks or similar items for the year ended december  but we expect such items to be part of our net sales in the future 
on september   we announced the commercial availability of qsymia in the us in september  we began distributing qsymia to two of the certified home delivery pharmacies  and later in  we added three more certified home delivery pharmacies to the network 
we currently recognize revenue for the sales of qsymia when the prescriptions are shipped to the patients by the pharmacies because we do not have sufficient historical information to reliably estimate returns 
at december   we have deferred revenue of million  which represents qsymia product shipped to customers but not yet shipped to patients through prescriptions  net of prompt payment discounts 
we expect qsymia product revenue and prescriptions shipped to patients to increase in as we continue to introduce qsymia to healthcare professionals 
in addition  we have submitted a request to the fda to modify our rems program to include access to select certified retail pharmacies 
if approved  we would be permitted to expand our distribution network which is currently limited to the certified pharmacies home delivery networks 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold is  for the year ended december  and relates to our product shipments of qsymia to patients and includes the inventory costs of apis  third party contract manufacturing and packaging and distribution costs  royalties  cargo insurance  freight  shipping  handling and storage costs  and overhead costs of the employees involved with production 
the cost of

research and development years ended december  change increase decrease drug indication description vs vs in thousands  except percentages qsymia for obesity stendra for ed other projects share based compensation overhead costs total research and development expenses overhead costs include compensation and related expenses  consulting  legal and other professional services fees relating to research and development activities  which we do not allocate to specific projects 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is primarily due to start up costs associated with the post approval studies for qsymia and stendra  partially offset by a decrease in stendra program costs due to the filing of the nda in june we anticipate that our research and development expenses in will increase significantly as compared to as we begin the post approval cardiovascular outcomes study for qsymia  known as acqlaim 
the details of acqlaim have not yet been agreed upon with the fda 
this study could cost between and million and take as long as five years to complete 
enrollment is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of there are likely to be additional research and development expenses for other post approval studies related to stendra and qsymia  and for our investigational drug candidates under development 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical and pre clinical studies 
the decrease in research and development expenses in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the completion of the phase development programs for qsymia and stendra 
selling  general and administrative change increase decrease years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative in the year ended december   the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses includes million of increased spending primarily due to qsymia pre commercialization and commercialization activities primarily related to marketing programs  market research and analytics and additional headcount  sales expenses of million primarily related to our contract sales

general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  decreased million  or to million as compared to the same period in in the year ended december   the decrease is primarily due to lower spending on qsymia pre commercialization expenses of million  partially offset by incremental increases of million in corporate expenses primarily compensation and related increases  million in stendra pre commercialization expenses and net increases in other general and administrative expense of million as compared to the year ended december  interest income and expense interest and other income  net in the year ended december  was  as compared to  in the year ended december  although our cash balances were higher in than in  interest and other income decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year largely due to lower interest rates  year over year  on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities and  in other income recognized in the year ended december  interest and other income  net for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest and other income in the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year was largely due to lower interest rates  year over year  on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities partially offset by an increase in other income of  in the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  was million

unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million is primarily the net result of cash provided by financing activities and cash used for investing and operating activities 
included in this increase are million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of our common stock and million in net proceeds from common stock option exercises and espp purchases during the year ended december  since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the issuance of equity securities

at december   all of our cash equivalents and available for sale securities were invested in either us government securities or money market funds that invest only in us treasury securities 
the investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal  however  there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy 
if those securities are downgraded or impaired  we would experience realized or unrealized losses in the value of our portfolio  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
investment securities are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit 
due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities  it is possible that changes in these risk factors in the near term could have an adverse material impact on our results of operations or stockholders equity 

table of contents accounts receivable 
we extend credit to our customers for product sales resulting in accounts receivable 
customer accounts are monitored for past due amounts 
past due accounts receivable  determined to be uncollectible  are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based upon past due amounts  historical losses and existing economic factors  and are adjusted periodically 
we offer cash discounts to our customers  generally of the sales price as an incentive for prompt payment 
accounts receivable net of allowance for cash discounts at december  was million  as compared to none at december  currently  we do not have any significant concerns related to accounts receivable or collections 
as of february   we had collected of the accounts receivable outstanding at december  revenues from significant customers as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december  is as follows cvs walgreens express scripts  inc liabilities 
total liabilities were million at december   which is million higher than at december  the change in total liabilities is primarily due to increased commercialization activities related to qsymia and the timing of payments 
operating activities 
our operating activities used million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   our net operating loss of million was offset by million in share based compensation expense due to increased headcount and a million net increase in accounts payable  primarily due to an increase in marketing and sales activities and startup costs for the post approval stendra and qsymia clinical trials 
the increase in accounts payable was offset by a million net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  which primarily was comprised of prepayments related to qsymia product liability insurance  manufacturing commitment fees  medical affairs activities for qsymia  and prepaid product commercialization costs for sales and marketing activities in support of the commercial launch of qsymia in the us these prepayments represent probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by us as a result of past transactions or events  which meet the definition of an asset under the fasb concept statement as such  the costs have been deferred as prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and will be charged to expense accordingly when the related prepaid services are rendered to us 
in addition  there was a net million increase in inventories  primarily for qsymia and pre launch inventory for stendra 
during the year ended december   our net operating loss of million was offset by million in share based compensation expense  a million increase in accrued employee compensation and benefits and a million increase in accounts payable 
these positive cash flows to our net operating loss were in turn offset by a million decrease in accrued research and clinical expenses 
during the year ended december   our net operating loss of million was offset by million in share based compensation expense  million in loss on early extinguishment of the deerfield loan  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets  and million in cash provided by discontinued operations

the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
commercialization of qsymia and stendra may be more costly than we planned 
in addition  completion of clinical trials and approval by the fda of investigational drug candidates may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of an investigational drug candidate 
it is also important to note that if an investigational drug candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a 
table of contents number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs at least through should product sales and planned partnering activities be significantly less than internal expectations  we would need to raise additional capital to support operating activities through and beyond 
we anticipate that we may require additional funding to continue our commercialization of qsymia  to conduct post approval clinical studies for both qsymia and stendra  to conduct non clinical and clinical research and development work to support regulatory submissions and applications for our current and future investigational drug candidates  to finance the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  to fund operating expenses  to establish additional or new manufacturing and marketing capabilities  to manufacture quantities of our drugs and investigational drug candidates and to make payments under our existing license agreements for qsymia and stendra 
while some of our anticipated costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the funding of our commercialization efforts  product development programs and our research and development plans in future periods beyond if we require additional capital  we may seek any required additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our commercialization or development programs or obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own

declaration or payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  operating results and current and anticipated cash needs 
cautionary note on forward looking statements our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in our research and development activities  including the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing our own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if our investigational drug candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the drug will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
for more information about the risks we face  see item a risk factors included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes

table of contents commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors

our cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors that specifies the categories money market funds  us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  and other securities  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
currently  we have focused on investing in us treasuries until market conditions improve 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment may decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately  in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate
