item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview the general partner is a self administered and self managed reit that began operations in and is the sole general partner of the partnership 
the partnership is a limited partnership formed in  at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the general partner  as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the general partner common shares  were contributed to the partnership 
simultaneously  the partnership completed the acquisition of duke associates  a full service commercial real estate firm operating in the midwest whose operations began in we operate the general partner and the partnership as one enterprise  and therefore  our discussion and analysis refers to the general partner and its consolidated subsidiaries  including the partnership  collectively 
as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office  medical office and other properties  of which properties with approximately million square feet are in service and properties with more than million square feet are under development 
the in service properties are comprised of consolidated properties with approximately million square feet and jointly controlled properties with more than million square feet 
the properties under development consist of consolidated properties with approximately million square feet and two jointly controlled properties with approximately  square feet 
owned  including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures  more than  acres of land and controlled an additional  acres through purchase options 
a key component of our overall strategy is to increase our investment in quality industrial properties in both existing and select new markets  expand our medical office portfolio nationally to take advantage of demographic trends and reduce our investment in suburban office properties and other non strategic assets 
we have four reportable operating segments at december   the first three of which consist of the ownership and rental of i industrial  ii office and iii medical office real estate investments 
the operations of our industrial  office and medical office properties  along with our retail properties  are collectively referred to as rental operations 
our retail properties  as well as any other properties not included in our reportable segments  do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment 
the fourth reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management  asset management  maintenance  leasing  development  general contractor and construction management to third party property owners and joint ventures  and is collectively referred to as service operations 
our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise 
our service operations segment also includes our taxable reit subsidiary  a legal entity through which certain of the segment operations are conducted 
during  one of the quantitative thresholds was triggered  which required our medical office property operating segment to be presented as a separate reportable segment 
as such  our medical office properties are presented as a separate reportable segment for the year ended december   as well as for the comparative prior periods 
operational strategy our operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as ffo through i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties  ii selectively developing new build to suit  substantially pre leased and  in limited circumstances  speculative development projects  iii leveraging our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager on a fee basis  and iv providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
asset strategy our asset strategy is to reposition our investment concentration among product types and further diversify our geographic presence 
our strategic objectives include i increasing our investment in quality industrial properties in both existing markets and select new markets  ii expanding our medical office portfolio nationally to take advantage of demographic trends  iii increasing our asset investment in markets we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth  and iv reducing our investment in suburban office properties located primarily in the midwest as well as reducing our investment in other non strategic assets 
we are executing our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying acquisition and development opportunities  while continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long term objectives 
capital strategy our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure  in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies 
we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies with the ultimate goal of further improving the key metrics that formulate our credit ratings 
in support of our capital strategy  we employ an asset disposition program to sell non strategic real estate assets  which generates proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or can be used to reduce leverage and otherwise manage our capital structure 
we continue to focus on improving our balance sheet by maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  and iii issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic acquisitions 
with our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet  we believe we are well positioned for future growth 
year in review there was modest overall economic improvement in certain key macroeconomic metrics  such as the national unemployment rate and the annual growth in the gross domestic product  however  the uncertainty around the november election  unresolved debt ceiling and fiscal cliff discussions  as well as persistent economic issues in europe continued to weigh heavily on the willingness and ability of businesses to make long term capital commitments during those macro economic factors produced challenges for our industry and specifically our business but  nonetheless  we improved several of our key operating metrics such as our in service occupancy  our total leasing activity and our tenant retention rate 
net loss attributable to the common shareholders of the general partner for the year ended december   was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted for the year ended december  net loss attributable to the common unitholders of the partnership for the year ended december   was million  or per unit diluted  compared to net income of million  or per unit diluted for the year ended december  for both the general partner and the partnership  the net loss position in  when compared to the net income generated in  was primarily the result of a building suburban office portfolio sale the blackstone office disposition in late in addition to the significantly higher gains on sale in  the blackstone office disposition resulted in lower operating results during  as we had a significantly lower base of income generating assets through the first half of until the proceeds from the blackstone office disposition were fully re invested in late according to plan 
ffo attributable to common shareholders of the general partner totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for ffo attributable to common unitholders of the partnership totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for for both the general partner and the partnership  the reduction in ffo from to was primarily due to the proceeds from the blackstone office disposition not being fully deployed into income generating assets until the second half of in addition to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  we assess and measure the overall operating results of the general partner and the partnership based upon ffo  which is an industry performance measure that management believes is a useful indicator of consolidated operating performance 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a reit 
nareit created ffo as a non gaap supplemental measure of reit operating performance 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents gaap net income loss  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap  gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the most comparable gaap measure is net income loss attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders 
ffo attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders or any other measures derived in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of nareit 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
management believes that the use of ffo attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders  combined with net income which remains the primary measure of performance  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management believes that the use of ffo as a performance measure enables investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit activity and assist them in comparing these operating results between periods or between different companies 
the following table shows a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders to the calculation of ffo attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands net income loss attributable to common shareholders of the general partner add back net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests common limited partnership interests in the partnership net income loss attributable to common unitholders of the partnership adjustments depreciation and amortization company share of joint venture depreciation and amortization earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture funds from operations attributable to common unitholders of the partnership additional general partner adjustments net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests common limited partnership interests in the partnership noncontrolling interest share of adjustments funds from operations attributable to common shareholders of the general partner we continued to make significant progress during in executing our stated asset strategy of increasing our investment in industrial and medical office properties and reducing our investment in suburban office properties 
additionally  we continued to improve our operational metrics  which is an indication of continued execution of our operational strategy 
highlights of our strategic activities are as follows during  we acquired medical office properties and ten industrial properties with a total combined value of million 
we generated million of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of wholly owned buildings and acres of wholly owned undeveloped land 
we had development starts of million within our consolidated properties  which were primarily comprised of industrial and medical office properties 
these development starts were pre leased 
we increased our level of development investment during as compared to the last few years 
the total estimated cost of our consolidated properties under construction was million at december   with million of such costs incurred through that date 
the total estimated cost for jointly controlled properties under construction was million at december   with million of costs incurred through that date 
the consolidated properties under construction are pre leased  while the jointly controlled properties under construction are pre leased 
the occupancy level for our in service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from at december  to at december  the increase in occupancy was primarily driven by leasing up vacant space  as well as our acquisition and disposition activities 
we continued to have strong total leasing activity for our consolidated properties  with total leasing activity of million square feet in compared to million square feet in total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in included million square feet of renewals  which represented an retention rate  on a square foot basis  and resulted in a increase in net effective rents 
we executed a number of significant transactions in support of our capital strategy during and january in order to optimally sequence our unsecured debt maturities  manage our overall leverage profile  and support our acquisition and development activities in alignment with our asset strategy 
highlights of our key financing activities are as follows in january  the general partner completed a public offering of million common shares  at an issue price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million and  after underwriting fees and estimated offering costs  net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the partnership existing revolving credit facility  which  as the result of recent acquisitions  had an outstanding balance of million as of december  the remaining proceeds will also be used to redeem all of the outstanding shares of the general partner series o cumulative redeemable preferred shares series o shares  which are redeemable as of february   and for general corporate purposes 
throughout  the general partner issued million shares of common stock pursuant to its at the market atm equity program  generating gross proceeds of approximately million and  after considering commissions and other costs  net proceeds of approximately million 
in october  we repaid million of medium term notes  which had an effective interest rate of  at their scheduled maturity date 
in september  we issued million of unsecured notes that bear interest at  have an effective rate of  and mature on october  in august  we repaid million of senior unsecured notes  which had an effective interest rate of  at their scheduled maturity date 
in june  we issued million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at  have an effective rate of  and mature on june  in march  the general partner redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its series m cumulative redeemable preferred shares series m shares at a liquidation amount of million 
we assumed nine secured loans in conjunction with our acquisitions 
these assumed loans had a total face value of million  a total fair value of million and carry a weighted average stated interest rate of 
we used a weighted average estimated market rate of in determining the fair value of these loans 
throughout  we repaid five secured loans at their respective maturity dates totaling million 
these loans had a weighted average stated interest rate of 
key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our rental operations 
the following discussion highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues 
occupancy analysis as previously discussed  our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue from continuing operations 
the following table sets forth percent leased and average net effective rent information regarding our in service portfolio of consolidated rental properties as of december  and  respectively in thousands  except percentage data total square feet percent of total square feet percent leased average annual net effective rent type industrial office medical office other total represents the percentage of total square feet leased based on executed leases and without regard to whether the leases have commenced 
represents average annual base rental payments per leased square foot  on a straight line basis for the term of each lease  from space leased to tenants at the end of the most recent reporting period 
this amount excludes additional amounts paid by tenants as reimbursement for operating expenses 
the increase in occupancy at december  compared to december  is primarily driven by increased leasing activity in compared to we renewed of our expiring leases during compared to during acquisitions of highly occupied properties also contributed to the improvement in overall occupancy  as we acquired properties during totaling approximately million square feet that had average occupancy on acquisition of 
the increase in average annual net effective rent per square foot is primarily the result of a shift in product mix  as we increased our investment in medical office properties  which generally earn a significantly higher rent per square foot than office and industrial properties  during total leasing activity the initial leasing of development projects or vacant space in acquired properties is referred to as first generation lease activity 
the re leasing of space that had been previously leased is referred to as second generation lease activity 
the total leasing activity for our consolidated rental properties  expressed in square feet of leases signed during the period  is as follows for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands new leasing activity first generation new leasing activity second generation renewal leasing activity total leasing activity new second generation leases the following table sets forth the estimated costs of tenant improvements and leasing commissions  on a per square foot basis  that we are obligated to fulfill under the new second generation leases signed for our consolidated rental properties during the years ended december  and  respectively square feet data in thousands square feet of new second generation leases average term in years estimated tenant improvement cost per square foot leasing commissions per square foot industrial office medical office other total the reduction in new second generation leases in was  in large part  correlated with the increase in the lease renewal percentage for the year  as we had less vacant space available to be re let to new tenants 
lease renewals the following table summarizes our lease renewal activity within our consolidated rental properties for the years ended december  and  respectively square feet data in thousands square feet of leases renewed percent of expiring leases renewed average term in years growth decline in net effective rents estimated tenant improvement cost per square foot leasing commissions per square foot industrial office medical office other total represents the percentage change in net effective rent between the original leases and the renewal leases 
net effective rents represent average annual base rental payments  on a straight line basis for the term of each lease  excluding operating expense reimbursements 
we were successful in executing renewals during across all product types and markets  with our large industrial spaces having the most impact 
the most significant individual renewal leases took place in our indianapolis  cincinnati  chicago and columbus industrial markets 
lease expirations our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates  and net effective rents  primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects our consolidated in service portfolio lease expiration schedule  including square footage and annualized net effective rent for expiring leases  by property type as of december  in thousands  except percentage data total consolidated portfolio industrial office medical office other year of expiration square feet ann

rent revenue and thereafter total leased total portfolio square feet percent leased annualized rental revenue represents average annual base rental payments  on a straight line basis for the term of each lease  from space leased to tenants at the end of the most recent reporting period 
annualized rental revenue excludes additional amounts paid by tenants as reimbursement for operating expenses 
information on current market rents can be difficult to obtain  is highly subjective  and is often not directly comparable between properties 
because of this  we believe the increase or decrease in net effective rent on lease renewals  as previously defined  is the most objective and meaningful relationship between rents on leases expiring in the near term and current market rents 
acquisition activity our decision process in determining whether or not to acquire a target property or portfolio involves several factors  including expected rent growth  multiple yield metrics  property locations and expected demographic growth in each location  current occupancy of the target properties  tenant profile and remaining terms of the in place leases in the target properties 
we pursue both brokered and non brokered acquisitions and it is difficult to predict which markets and product types may present acquisition opportunities 
because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions  we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions 
we acquired properties during the year ended december  and properties  in addition to other real estate related assets  during the year ended december  the following table summarizes the acquisition price  percent leased at time of acquisition and in place yields  by product type  for these acquisitions in thousands  except percentage data acquisitions acquisitions type acquisition price in place yield percent leased at acquisition date acquisition price in place yield percent leased at acquisition date industrial office medical office total includes real estate assets and net acquired lease related intangible assets but excludes other acquired working capital assets and liabilities 
in place yields of completed acquisitions are calculated as the current annualized net rental payments from space leased to tenants at the date of acquisition  divided by the acquisition price of the acquired real estate 
annualized net rental payments are comprised of base rental payments  excluding additional amounts payable by tenants as reimbursement for operating expenses  less current annualized operating expenses not recovered through tenant reimbursements 
represents percentage of total square feet leased based on executed leases and without regard to whether the leases have commenced  at the date of acquisition 
disposition activity we regularly work to identify  consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans 
we sold buildings during the year ended december  and buildings during the year ended december  the following table summarizes the sales prices  in place yields and percent leased  by product type  of these building sales in thousands  except percentage data dispositions dispositions type sales price in place yield percent leased sales price in place yield percent leased industrial office other total in place yields of completed dispositions are calculated as current annualized net rental payments from space leased to tenants at the date of sale  divided by the sales price of the real estate

represents percentage of total square feet leased based on executed leases and without regard to whether the leases have commenced  at the date of sale 
development another source of our earnings growth is our wholly owned and joint venture development activities 
we expect to generate future earnings from rental operations as the development properties are placed in service and leased 
we increased our development activities in for industrial and medical office properties with significant pre leasing  as well as for speculative developments  in limited circumstances  in markets that we believe will provide future growth 
we believe these two product lines will be the areas of greatest future growth 
we had million square feet of consolidated or jointly controlled properties under development with total estimated costs upon completion of million at december   compared to  square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of million at december  the square footage and estimated costs include both wholly owned and joint venture development activity at 
the following table summarizes our properties under development as of december  in thousands  except percentage data ownership type square feet percent leased total estimated project costs total incurred to date amount remaining to be spent consolidated properties joint venture properties total we directly own over  acres of undeveloped land  of which we intend to develop over  acres 
we believe that the land we intend to develop can support over million square feet of primarily industrial  but also office and medical office  developments 
results of operations a summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   is as follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share or per common unit data rental and related revenue from continuing operations general contractor and service fee revenue operating income general partner net income loss attributable to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common shares and potential dilutive securities partnership net income loss attributable to common unitholders weighted average common units outstanding weighted average common units and potential dilutive securities general partner and partnership basic income loss per common share or common unit continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income loss per common share or common unit continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service consolidated properties at end of year in service consolidated square footage at end of year number of in service joint venture properties at end of year in service joint venture square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental and related revenue the following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment  as well as total rental and related revenue from discontinued operations  for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental and related revenue industrial office medical office other total rental and related revenue from continuing operations rental and related revenue from discontinued operations total rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below we acquired properties  of which were industrial and were medical office  and placed eleven developments in service from january  to december   which provided incremental revenues of million in the year ended december  over the sale of office properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in the first quarter of resulted in a million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in  which partially offset the impact of newly acquired or developed properties 
the remaining increase in rental and related revenue from continuing operations is primarily due to improved results within the properties that have been in service for all of and higher levels of occupancy primarily drove the overall improvement within these properties  as rental rates increased modestly but did not significantly contribute to the increase in revenues from continuing operations 
the overall shift of revenues and income from office properties to industrial and medical office properties is consistent with our continuing strategy to increase our asset concentration in industrial and medical office properties while reducing our overall investment in office properties 
the decrease in rental revenues from discontinued operations is primarily a result of the blackstone office disposition that took place in december rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations by reportable segment  as well as total rental expenses and real estate taxes from discontinued operations  for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses industrial office medical office other total rental expenses from continuing operations rental expenses from discontinued operations total rental expenses from continuing and discontinued operations real estate taxes industrial office medical office other total real estate tax expense from continuing operations real estate tax expense from discontinued operations total real estate tax expense from continuing and discontinued operations overall  rental expenses from continuing operations increased by million in compared to while we recognized incremental rental expenses of million associated with the additional properties acquired and eleven developments placed in service since january   we also sold office properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in late march  which resulted in a million decrease in rental expenses from continuing operations in as compared to overall  real estate taxes from continuing operations increased by million in compared to we recognized incremental real estate tax expense of million associated with the additional properties acquired and eleven developments placed in service since january  this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in real estate taxes from continuing operations related to the properties that were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture during the first quarter of service operations the following table sets forth the components of the service operations reportable segment for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands service operations general contractor and service fee revenue general contractor and other services expenses total service operations primarily consist of the leasing  property management  asset management  development  construction management and general contractor services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
service operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy  as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy  while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third party property owners and joint venture partners 
a significant decrease in third party construction volume in compared to  due to some significant third party construction jobs being completed  drove the decrease in our earnings from service operations 
in  we focused more of our internal resources on the development and leasing of properties we own rather than on replacing the third party construction contracts that were completed 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to depreciation related to additions to our continuing operations asset base from acquisition activity  which have shorter depreciable lives relative to developed properties  and developments placed in service in and gain on sale of properties continuing operations we sold properties during that did not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations  recognizing total gains on sale of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of two components 
the first component includes general corporate expenses and the second component includes the indirect operating costs not allocated to  or absorbed by  the development or rental operations of our wholly owned properties or our service operations 
the indirect operating costs that are either allocated to  or absorbed by  the development or rental operations of our wholly owned properties  or our service operations  are primarily comprised of employee compensation  including related costs such as benefits and wage related taxes  but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support 
total indirect operating costs  prior to any allocation or absorption  and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs 
those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
we regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing  development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead  generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments  as necessary in order to control overall general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from to in millions general and administrative expenses reduction to overall pool of overhead costs increased absorption of costs by wholly owned development and leasing activities reduced allocation of costs to service operations and rental operations general and administrative expenses we reduced our total pool of overhead costs  through staff reductions and other measures  as the result of changes in our product mix and anticipated future levels of third party construction  leasing  management and other operational activities 
we increased our focus on development of wholly owned properties  and also significantly increased our leasing activity during  which resulted in an increased absorption of overhead costs 
we capitalized million and million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development  respectively  for consolidated properties during  compared to capitalizing million and million of such costs  respectively  for combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled and of our overall pool of overhead costs for and  respectively 
the reduction in the allocation of overhead costs to service operations and rental operations resulted from reduced volumes of third party construction projects as well as due to reducing our overall investment in office properties  which are more management intensive 
interest expense interest expense allocable to continuing operations increased from million in to million in we had million of interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in  associated with the properties that were disposed of during  compared to the allocation of only million of interest expense to discontinued operations for total interest expense  combined for continuing and discontinued operations  decreased from million in to million in the reduction in total interest expense was primarily the result of a lower weighted average borrowing rate in  due to refinancing some higher rate bonds in and  as well as a slight decrease in our average level of borrowings compared to also  due to an increase in properties under development from  which met the criteria for capitalization of interest and were financed in part by common equity issuances during  a million increase in capitalized interest also contributed to the decrease in total interest expense in acquisition related activity during  we recognized approximately million in acquisition costs  compared to million of such costs in the increase from to is the result of acquiring a higher volume of medical office properties  where a higher level of acquisition costs are incurred than other property types  in during  we also recognized a million gain related to the acquisition of a building from one of our owned unconsolidated joint ventures 
discontinued operations subject to certain criteria  the results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties  or classified as held for sale at the end of the period  are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  allocated interest expense and depreciation expense  as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
the operations of buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations 
these buildings consist of office  industrial  four retail  and two medical office properties 
as a result  we classified operating losses  before gain on sales  of million  million and million in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these properties  were sold during  properties were sold during and properties were sold during the gains on disposal of these properties of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations 
there are two properties classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations at december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental and related revenue the following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment  as well as total rental and related revenue from discontinued operations  for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental and related revenue industrial office medical office other total rental and related revenue from continuing operations rental and related revenue from discontinued operations total rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below we acquired properties  of which were industrial  and placed nine developments in service from january  to december   which provided incremental revenues of million in the year ended december  over we consolidated industrial buildings as a result of acquiring our joint venture partner interest in dugan realty  llc dugan on july  the consolidation of these buildings resulted in an increase of million in rental and related revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in we sold office properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in and the first quarter of  resulting in a million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the remaining increase in rental and related revenues is primarily due to improved results within the properties that have been in service for all of and although rental rates declined slightly on our lease renewals  the effect was not significant to revenues and improved occupancy drove the overall improvement within these properties 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations by reportable segment  as well as total rental expenses and real estate taxes from discontinued operations  for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses industrial office medical office other total rental expenses from continuing operations rental expenses from discontinued operations total rental expenses from continuing and discontinued operations real estate taxes industrial office medical office other total real estate tax expense from continuing operations real estate tax expense from discontinued operations total real estate tax expense from continuing and discontinued operations we recognized incremental rental expenses of million associated with the additional properties acquired of which were industrial and nine developments placed in service since january  the july  consolidation of industrial buildings in dugan also resulted in a million increase in rental expense for industrial properties 
the aforementioned increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to properties that were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture during and the first quarter of we recognized incremental real estate taxes of million associated with the additional properties acquired and nine developments placed in service since january  the july  consolidation of industrial buildings in dugan resulted in incremental real estate taxes of million 
the aforementioned increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to properties that were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture during and the first quarter of the remaining increases were the result of increased taxes on our properties that have been in service for all of and service operations the following table sets forth the components of the service operations reportable segment for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands service operations general contractor and service fee revenue general contractor and other services expenses total the increase in earnings from service operations was due to increased profitability on third party construction activities performed during compared to  as overall construction volume was relatively consistent between the years 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in primarily as the result of acquisition activity  where depreciation expense is accelerated relative to developed properties  in and equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income or loss from investments in unconsolidated companies that generally own and operate rental properties 
equity in earnings decreased from million in to million in the decrease was largely due to the consolidation of properties upon the acquisition of our partner interest in dugan on july  gain on sale of properties continuing operations gains on sales of properties classified in continuing operations increased from million in to million in we sold properties during that did not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations  compared to of such properties in of the properties sold in and  and seven properties  respectively  were sold to a owned joint venture 
the combined gain on sale of these properties was million and million in and  respectively 
impairment charges impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other real estate related assets 
the increase from million in to million in is primarily due to the following activity in  we recognized million of impairment charges related to parcels of land  which we intend to sell  where recent market activity led us to determine that a decline in fair value had occurred 
in  we sold approximately acres of land  in two separate transactions  which resulted in impairment charges of million 
these sales were opportunistic in nature and we had not identified or actively marketed this land for disposition  as it was previously intended to be held for development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from to in millions general and administrative expenses increase to overall pool of overhead costs increased absorption of costs by wholly owned development and leasing activities increased allocation of costs to service operations and rental operations general and administrative expenses the increase to our overall pool of overhead costs from is largely due to increased severance pay related to overhead reductions that took place near the end of our total leasing activity increased and we also increased wholly owned development activities from we capitalized million and million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development  respectively  for consolidated properties during  compared to capitalizing million and million of such costs  respectively  for combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled and of our overall pool of overhead costs for and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily a result of increased average outstanding debt during compared to  which was driven by our acquisition activities as well as other uses of capital 
a million decrease in the capitalization of interest costs  the result of developed properties no longer meeting the criteria for interest capitalization  also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
gain loss on debt transactions there were no gains or losses on debt transactions during during  through a cash tender offer and open market transactions  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in and in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million 
we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of million after considering the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  discounts and other accounting adjustments 
acquisition related activity during  we recognized approximately million in acquisition costs  compared to million of such costs in during  we also recognized a million gain related to the acquisition of a building from one of our owned unconsolidated joint ventures  compared to a million gain in on the acquisition of our joint venture partner interest in dugan 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions  and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest entity a vie and would require consolidation 
we i evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity at risk  ii review the voting rights and decision making authority of the equity investment holders as a group  and whether there are any guaranteed returns  protection against losses  or capping of residual returns within the group and iii establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this vie determination 
to the extent that we i are the sole entity that has the power to direct the activities of the vie and ii have the obligation or rights to absorb the vie losses or receive its benefits  then we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie and would consolidate it 
at each reporting period  we re assess our conclusions as to which  if any  party within the vie is considered the primary beneficiary 
to the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as vies  we further assess each partner substantive participating rights to determine if the venture should be consolidated 
we have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
to the extent applicable  we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be vie where we are the primary beneficiary 
for non variable interest entities  we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in earnings of the joint venture 
we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
we capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains occupancy 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized 
impairment of real estate assets we evaluate our real estate assets  with the exception of those that are classified as held for sale  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such an evaluation is considered necessary  we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset  or asset group  with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of that asset  or asset group 
our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on  among other things  our estimates regarding future market conditions  rental rates  occupancy levels  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other tenant concessions  assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is  therefore  subjective by nature 
these assumptions could differ materially from actual results 
if our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date  an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material 
to the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset  or asset group  exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective  especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions 
we primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets 
to the extent that the assumptions used in testing long lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant  the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured 
in addition to determining future cash flows  which make the estimation of a real estate asset undiscounted cash flows highly subjective  the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective 
to the extent applicable marketplace data is available  we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired 
real estate assets that are classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
acquisition of real estate property and related assets we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values  using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition 
the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant 
this as if vacant value is estimated using an income  or discounted cash flow  approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties 
the most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate  discount rate  estimated market rents  and hypothetical expected lease up periods 
the purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases and the value of in place leases 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet  both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
factors considered in determining the value allocable to in place leases include estimates  during hypothetical expected lease up periods  of space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition  of lost rent at market rates  fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants  and theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
we record assets acquired in step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest 
additionally  contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of rent due under leases or of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and prospective tenants before leases are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of current rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is recognized based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
to the extent that a fixed price contract is estimated to result in a loss  the loss is recorded immediately 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regard to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting our critical accounting policies  methodology in applying our critical accounting policies  and impact of the critical accounting policies on our financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions as well as the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets  primarily through working capital  net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 
at december  we held million of cash and we had million of outstanding borrowings on the partnership million unsecured line of credit 
in addition to our existing sources of liquidity  we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other capital improvements  through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow  proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets 
in january  the general partner completed a public offering of million common shares  at an issue price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million and  after underwriting fees and estimated offering costs  net proceeds of approximately million 
a portion of the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the partnership existing revolving credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of million as of december   and the remaining proceeds will be used to redeem all of the general partner outstanding series o shares  which are redeemable as of february   and for general corporate purposes 
rental operations cash flows from rental operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable cash flow to fund operational expenses 
we believe that this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of  or a short time following  the actual revenue recognition 
we are subject to a number of risks related to general economic conditions  including reduced occupancy  tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
unsecured debt and equity securities our unsecured line of credit as of december  is described as follows in thousands description borrowing capacity maturity date outstanding balance at december  unsecured line of credit partnership december all amounts that were outstanding on the line of credit at december  were repaid in january with proceeds from the general partner common equity offering 
the partnership unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of million with the interest rate on borrowings of libor plus equal to for borrowings as of december  and a maturity date of december subject to certain conditions  the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional million  for a total of up to billion 
this line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
this line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance  including those related to fixed charge coverage  unsecured interest expense coverage and debt to asset value with asset value being defined in the partnership unsecured line of credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit 
at december   we had on file with the sec an automatic shelf registration statement on form s relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities including guarantees of the partnership debt securities by the general partner 
equity securities are offered and sold by the general partner and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the partnership in exchange for additional general partner units or preferred units 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes 
on february   the general partner entered into an at the market equity program that allowed it to issue new common shares  from time to time  with an aggregate offering price of up to million 
the general partner fully utilized this program during the first three months of  issuing approximately million common shares  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
the general partner paid approximately million in commissions related to the sales of these common shares and  after considering those commissions and other costs  generated net proceeds of approximately million from the offerings 
on may   the general partner entered into a new at the market equity program that allows it to issue new common shares  from time to time  with an aggregate offering price of up to million 
through december   the general partner has issued approximately million common shares under this program  resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million 
the general partner paid approximately million in commissions related to the sales of these common shares and  after considering those commissions and other costs  generated net proceeds of approximately million from the offerings 
the indentures and related supplemental indentures governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  sale of real estate assets we regularly work to identify  consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of non strategic properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans 
our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms  or at all  is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable 
although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non strategic properties  potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties 
transactions with unconsolidated entities transactions with unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity 
from time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated entities  while retaining a continuing interest in that entity  and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own 
additionally  unconsolidated entities will from time to time obtain debt financing and will distribute to us  and our joint venture partners  all or a portion of the proceeds from such debt financing 
uses of liquidity our principal uses of liquidity include the following property investment  leasing capital costs  dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders  long term debt maturities  opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt and preferred stock  and other contractual obligations 
property investment we continue to pursue an asset repositioning strategy that involves increasing our investment concentration in industrial and medical office properties while reducing our investment concentration in suburban office properties 
pursuant to this strategy  we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook  including general economic conditions  supply and long term growth potential 
our ability to make future property investments  along with being dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities  is also dependent upon our continued access to our longer term sources of liquidity  including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties 
leasing capital costs tenant improvements and leasing commissions related to the initial leasing of newly completed or vacant space in acquired properties are referred to as first generation expenditures 
such expenditures are included within development of real estate investments and other deferred leasing costs in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
tenant improvements and leasing costs to re let rental space that had been previously under lease to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures 
building improvements that are not specific to any tenant but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties are also second generation expenditures 
one of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing capital expenditures of our real estate investments 
as illustrated in the tables below  we have significantly reduced such expenditures in as a direct result of repositioning our investment concentration in office properties in accordance with our asset strategy 
the following is a summary of our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure in thousands second generation tenant improvements second generation leasing costs building improvements total the following is a summary of our second generation capital expenditures by reportable operating segment in thousands industrial office medical office non reportable rental operations segments total both our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis  dependent upon several factors including the product type  the nature of a tenant operations  the specific physical characteristics of each individual property as well as the market in which the property is located 
second generation expenditures related to the suburban office buildings that were sold in the blackstone office disposition in december totaled million in and million in dividends and distributions the general partner is required to meet the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  in order to maintain its reit status 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow will typically be greater than operating income 
we paid dividends or distributions of per common share or common unit for each of the years ended december   and we expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings  to meet the requirements to maintain the general partner reit status  and additional amounts as determined by the general partner board of directors 
distributions are declared at the discretion of the general partner board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements and such other factors as the general partner board of directors deems relevant 
at december  the general partner had four series of preferred stock outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on the general partner preferred shares range between and and are paid in arrears quarterly 
in january  the general partner called for redemption all of its outstanding series o shares 
the redemption date is february  and the cash redemption price is million 
as a result of this redemption  the general partner will reduce its future quarterly dividend commitments by million 
in march  the general partner redeemed all of its series m shares for a total payment of million  thus reducing its future quarterly dividend commitments by million 
in july  the general partner redeemed all of its series n cumulative redeemable preferred shares series n shares for a total payment of million  thus reducing its future quarterly dividend commitments by million 
debt maturities debt outstanding at december  had a face value totaling billion with a weighted average interest rate of and with maturity dates ranging between and of this total amount  we had billion of unsecured debt  billion of secured debt and million outstanding on the partnership unsecured line of credit at december  scheduled principal amortization and maturities of such debt totaled million for the year ended december  the following is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at december  in thousands  except percentage data future repayments weighted average year scheduled amortization maturities total interest rate of future repayments thereafter we anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our rental operations and property dispositions  and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions  such as our january common offering 
repurchases of outstanding debt and preferred stock the general partner paid million in march to redeem its series m shares at par value 
in january  the general partner called for redemption all  of its outstanding series o shares 
the redemption date is february  and the cash redemption price for the series o shares is million  or per share 
to the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy  we may purchase certain of our outstanding unsecured debt prior to its stated maturity or the general partner may redeem or repurchase certain of its outstanding series of preferred stock 
guarantee obligations we are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and  in most cases  do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments 
we are  however  subject to a joint and several guarantee of the loan agreement of the peachtree joint venture 
a contingent liability in the amount of million  which represents our maximum remaining future exposure under the guarantee  is included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  based on the probability of us being required to pay this obligation to the lender 
historical cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating  investing and financing activities in thousands years ended december  general partner net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities partnership net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our rental operations and service operations activities 
the receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows 
the decrease in cash flows from operations from to  noted in the table above  was primarily due to the overall reduction in rental revenues from discontinued operations  which was driven by the disposition of a significant portion of our office properties in december this overall change in product mix correspondingly drove a million decrease in cash outflows for second generation capital expenditures classified within investing activities during the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from to is  in large part  due to a million increase in cash outflows from third party construction contracts as well as a million increase in cash paid for interest 
our third party construction activities were profitable  in the aggregate  during and the net cash outflows during the year were the result of the timing of cash receipts and payments 
investing activities investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity 
development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements 
highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows real estate development costs totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have increased our development activities in for industrial and medical office properties 
during  we paid cash of million for real estate acquisitions  compared to million in and million in in addition  we paid cash of million for undeveloped land in  compared to million in and million in the increase in land acquisitions in is the result of land acquired for specific development projects that commenced shortly after acquisition 
sales of land and depreciated property provided million in net proceeds in  compared to billion in and million in we received capital distributions as a result of the sale of properties or refinancing from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million in  million in and million in during  we contributed or advanced million to fund development activities within unconsolidated companies  compared to million in and million in financing activities the following items highlight significant capital transactions throughout  the general partner issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
the general partner had no common stock issuances in in june  the general partner issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
in march  the general partner redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its series m shares for a total payment of million 
in july  the general partner redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its series n shares for a total payment of million 
throughout and  the general partner completed open market repurchases of approximately  shares and million shares  respectively  of its series o shares 
the general partner paid million in for shares that had a face value of million  compared to million in for shares that had a face value of million 
in september  we issued million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at and mature on october  in june  we issued million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at and mature on june  we had no senior unsecured note issuances in in april  we issued million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at an effective rate of and mature in march in october  we repaid million of medium term notes  which had an effective interest rate of  at their scheduled maturity date 
in august  we repaid million of senior unsecured notes  which had an effective interest rate of  at their scheduled maturity date 
in july  one of our consolidated subsidiaries repaid million of variable rate unsecured debt  which bore interest at a rate of libor plus  at its scheduled maturity 
in december  we repaid the remaining million of our exchangeable notes  which had an effective interest rate of  at their scheduled maturity date 
in august and march  we also repaid million and million  respectively  of unsecured notes with an effective rate of and  respectively  at their scheduled maturity dates 
in january  we repaid million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of at their scheduled maturity date 
during  through a cash tender offer and open market transactions  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in and in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million 
throughout the year ended december   we repaid five secured loans totaling million  which had a weighted average stated interest rate of  at their maturity dates 
this compares to payoffs of million in  comprised of four individually insignificant secured loans  and million in  which was secured debt that we assumed upon the july acquisition of our joint venture partner interest in dugan 
we increased net borrowings on the partnership million line of credit by million for the year ended december   compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million in we paid cash dividends or distributions of per common share or per common unit in each of the years ended december   and credit ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from moody investors service and standard and poor ratings group 
our senior unsecured notes have been assigned ratings of bbb and baa by standard and poor ratings group and moody investors service  respectively 
our preferred shares carry ratings of bb and baa from standard and poor ratings group and moody investors service  respectively 
the ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred shares could change based upon  among other things  the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition 
financial instruments we are exposed to capital market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk  we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in unconsolidated companies we have equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships and limited liability companies that primarily own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily engaged in the operations and development of industrial  office and medical office real estate properties 
the equity method of accounting see critical accounting policies is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over operating and financial policies 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these entities are not included on our balance sheet 
our investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries represent approximately of our total assets as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that these investments provide several benefits to us  including increased market share  tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects 
the following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated companies for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands  except percentage data joint ventures land  buildings and tenant improvements  net construction in progress undeveloped land other assets indebtedness other liabilities owners equity rental revenue gain on sale of properties net income total square feet percent leased represents the percentage of total square feet leased based on executed leases and without regard to whether the leases have commenced 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships special purpose entities that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations at december   we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the following table payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt line of credit share of unconsolidated joint ventures debt ground leases operating leases development and construction backlog costs other total contractual obligations our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rates as of december  our unsecured line of credit consists of an operating line of credit that matures december interest expense for our unsecured line of credit was calculated using the most recent stated interest rate that was in effect 
our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of owned development projects and third party construction projects 
related party transactions we provide property and asset management  leasing  construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we earned management fees of million  million and million  leasing fees of million  million and million and construction and development fees of million  million and million from these companies  prior to elimination 
we recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services  and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies we have guaranteed the repayment of million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments 
we will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service 
management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees 
we also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of five of our unconsolidated subsidiaries 
at december   the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately million 
included in our total guarantee exposure is a joint and several guarantee of the loan agreement of the peachtree joint venture  which had a carrying amount of million on the balance sheet at december  we lease certain land positions with terms extending to october  with a total obligation of million 
no payments on these ground leases  which are classified as operating leases  are material in any individual year 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
we own certain parcels of land that are subject to special property tax assessments levied by quasi municipal entities 
to the extent that such special assessments are fixed and determinable  the discounted value of the full assessment is recorded as a liability 
we have million of such special assessment liabilities  which are included within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term borrowings 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have two outstanding swaps  which fix the rates on two of our variable rate loans and are not significant to our financial statements at december  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts in thousands of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period  fair values in thousands and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes

as a result  the ultimate impact of interest rate fluctuations will depend on future exposures that arise  our hedging strategies at that time to the extent we are party to interest rate derivatives  and interest rates 
interest expense on our unsecured line of credit will be affected by fluctuations in libor indices as well as changes in our credit rating 
the interest rate at such point in the future as we may renew  extend or replace our unsecured line of credit will be heavily dependent upon the state of the credit environment 
at december   the face value of our unsecured debt was billion and we estimated the fair value of that unsecured debt to be billion 
at december   the face value of our unsecured notes was billion and our estimate of the fair value of that debt was billion
