overview alimera sciences  inc we  alimera or the company is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the research  development and commercialization of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals 
we are presently focused on diseases affecting the back of the eye  or retina  because we believe these diseases are not well treated with current therapies and represent a significant market opportunity 
our most advanced product candidate is iluvien  which has received marketing authorization in austria  the united kingdom  portugal  france  germany and spain  and has been recommended for marketing authorization in italy  for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic diabetic macular edema dme considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies 
dme is a disease of the retina that affects individuals with diabetes and can lead to severe vision loss and blindness 
iluvien has not been approved by the us food and drug administration fda 
we currently plan to launch iluvien in germany  the united kingdom and france in  and are pursuing pricing and reimbursement in those countries 
in july  we received a letter from germany s federal joint committee indicating that the automatic obligation to submit a dossier on iluvien  per the arzneimittelmarkt neuordnungsgesetz law  would not be necessary  and that a benefit assessment would not be required 
receipt of this letter allows us to launch iluvien in germany without price restriction 
in january  the united kingdom s national institute for health and clinical excellence nice published final guidance indicating that iluvien is not cost effective for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic dme considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies given the cost of we subsequently submitted a simple patient access scheme pas for iluvien to the patient access schemes liaison unit paslu which has been agreed to by the united kingdom department of health and is now under consideration by nice for inclusion in its rapid review facility 
under this facility  the appraisal committee at nice is expected to assess the impact of the iluvien pas on iluvien cost effectiveness and determine whether an update to the recently published final guidance is warranted 

table of contents we submitted a new drug application nda in june for iluvien in the us with the us food and drug administration fda and in december  we received a complete response letter crl from the fda regarding our nda 
the primary concerns expressed in the crl centered on the benefits of iluvien in treating dme patients versus the risk of its side effects 
upon further analysis of the fame study data through its final readout at month  we determined that a pre planned subgroup of chronic dme patients demonstrated a greater benefit to risk profile than the full population dataset in our original nda filing 
we submitted our response to the crl to the fda in may  including additional safety and efficacy data through month of the fame study with an emphasis on the chronic dme subgroup 
in november  the fda issued a second crl to communicate that the nda could not be approved in its then current form stating that the nda did not provide sufficient data to support that iluvien is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with dme 
the fda stated that the risks of adverse reactions shown for iluvien in the fame study were significant and were not offset by the benefits demonstrated by iluvien in these clinical trials 
in its second crl  the fda indicated that we would need to conduct two additional clinical trials to demonstrate that iluvien is safe and effective for the proposed indication 
during the second quarter of  we met with the fda in an effort to gain a better understanding of the regulatory path for iluvien in the us based upon this meeting  we submitted a response to the second crl to the fda in the first quarter of  which included additional analysis of the benefits and risks of iluvien based upon clinical data available from the fame study 
we do not plan to conduct additional trials for dme at this time 
we commenced operations in june since our inception we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we have accumulated a deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial losses through the projected commercialization of iluvien as we complete the clinical development and registration of iluvien  prepare for the anticipated commercial launch of iluvien in the eu in  at the earliest  continue to seek regulatory approval of iluvien in the us and other jurisdictions  evaluate the use of iluvien for the treatment of other diseases  and advance the clinical development of other new product candidates either currently in our pipeline  or that we may license or acquire in the future 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we plan to proceed with the direct commercialization of iluvien in germany  the united kingdom and france in we believe that we has sufficient funds available to fund our operations beyond the projected commercialization of iluvien in these eu countries 
we do not expect the generation of revenue until  and therefore do not expect to have positive cash flow from operations until  if at all 
if iluvien is not approved in additional jurisdictions or does not generate sufficient revenue  we may adjust our commercial plans so that we can continue to operate with our existing cash resources or seek to raise additional financing 
our agreement with psivida us  inc we entered into an agreement with psivida us  inc psivida for the use of fluocinolone acetonide fac in psivida s proprietary delivery device in february  which was subsequently amended and restated in psivida is a global drug delivery company committed to the biomedical sector and the development of drug delivery products 
our agreement with psivida provides us with a worldwide exclusive license to develop and sell iluvien  which consists of a tiny polyimide tube with membrane caps that is filled with fac in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix for delivery to the back of the eye for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans other than uveitis 
this agreement also provides us with a worldwide non exclusive license to develop and sell psivida s proprietary delivery device to deliver other corticosteroids to the back of the eye for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans other than uveitis or to treat dme by delivering a compound to the back of the eye through a direct delivery method through an incision required for a gauge or larger needle 
we do not have the right to develop and sell psivida s proprietary delivery device for indications for diseases outside of the eye or for the treatment of uveitis 
further  our agreement with psivida permits psivida to grant to any other party the right to use its intellectual property i to treat dme through an incision smaller than that required for a gauge needle  unless using a corticosteroid delivered to the back of the eye  ii to deliver any compound outside the back of the eye unless it is to treat dme through an incision required for a gauge or larger needle  or iii to deliver non corticosteroids to the back of the eye  unless it is to treat dme through an incision required for a gauge or larger needle 
the agreement provides that after commercialization of iluvien  profits  as defined in the amended and restated agreement  will provide us with of the net profits and psivida with of the net profits 
in connection with this arrangement we are entitled to recover of commercialization costs of iluvien  as defined in the agreement  incurred prior to product profitability out of psivida s share of net profits 
as of december  and  psivida owed us 
table of contents million and million  respectively  in commercialization costs 
due to the uncertainty of future profits from iluvien  we have fully reserved these amounts in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements 
we will owe psivida an additional milestone payment of million if iluvien is approved by the fda 
if we were to enter into any sub license of iluvien  we must share of net profits and of any lump sum milestone payments received from a sub licensee  as defined in the agreement  with psivida 
our credit facility term loan agreement on october  effective date  we entered into a loan and security agreement term loan agreement with silicon valley bank and midcap financial llp lenders 
pursuant to the original terms of the term loan agreement  we were entitled to borrow up to million  of which million term loan a was advanced to us on the effective date 
we were entitled to draw down the remaining million under the term loan term loan b and together with term loan a  the term loan if the fda approved our nda for iluvien prior to or on july  on may   the lenders and we amended the term loan agreement term loan modification to  among other things  extend until december  the date by which the fda must have approved the nda in order for us to draw down term loan b and increase the amount of term loan b by million to million 
in addition  the maturity date of the term loan was extended from october  to april  term loan maturity date 
as a result of the issuance of the second crl by the fda in november  we did not draw down term loan b by december  and the availability to draw down term loan b expired 
we will owe the lenders a final interest payment on the term loan maturity date equal to of the total amount borrowed 
as of december  and  we recognized  and  respectively  of accrued interest expense  which is included in other long term liabilities  for the final interest payment 
we were required to pay interest on term loan a at a rate of on a monthly basis through july   and since august  we have been required to repay the principal in equal monthly installments plus interest at a rate of 
if we repay term loan a prior to maturity  we must pay to the lenders a prepayment fee equal to of the total amount of principal then outstanding  provided that such fee will be reduced by in the event that the prepayment occurs in connection with an acquisition of us 
to secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed under the term loan agreement  we granted to the lenders a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including our intellectual property  however  the lien on our intellectual property will be released if we meet certain financial conditions 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the term loan agreement and an increase to the applicable interest rate  and would permit the lenders to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral under the term loan agreement 
we also agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber our intellectual property assets 
additionally  we must seek the lenders approval prior to the payment of any cash dividends to our stockholders 
on the effective date  we issued to the lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock 
each of the warrants is exercisable immediately  has a per share exercise price of and has a term of years 
we estimated the fair value of warrants granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the aggregate fair value of the warrants was estimated to be  we allocated a portion of the proceeds from the term loan agreement to the warrants in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  debt instruments with detachable warrants 
as a result  we recorded a discount of  which is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method 
the lenders will have certain registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of all of their warrants 
we paid to the lenders an upfront fee of  on the effective date and an additional fee of  in connection with the term loan modification 
in accordance with asc  debt modifications and extinguishments  we are amortizing the unamortized discount on term loan a and the  modification fee over the remaining term of term loan a  as modified 
the lenders also hold warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock  which would have been exercisable only if term loan b had been advanced 
as a result of the issuance of the second crl by the fda in november  we did not draw down term loan b by december  and the ability to draw down term loan b expired 
consequently  the warrants issued to the lenders in connection with term loan b are not exercisable 
we are required to maintain our primary operating and other deposit accounts and securities accounts with silicon valley bank  which accounts must represent at least of the dollar value of our accounts at all financial institutions 

table of contents the weighted average interest rate of our notes payable to silicon valley bank and midcap financial llp approximates the rate at which we could obtain alternative financing  therefore  the carrying amount of the notes approximates their fair value 
on february   we received a letter from the lenders stating that they reserve the right to assert that recent events  including the issuance by the fda of the second crl and a decrease in the market value of our public equity securities  may represent a material impairment of the value of the collateral under the loan agreements 
to date  the lenders have not made such an assertion  and in our opinion a material impairment of the value of the collateral has not occurred 
working capital revolver also on the effective date  we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  pursuant to which we obtained a secured revolving line of credit working capital revolver from silicon valley bank with borrowing availability up to million revolving loan agreement 
on may   silicon valley bank and we amended the revolving loan agreement to extend the maturity date of the working capital revolver from october  to april  the working capital revolver is a working capital based revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount of up to the lesser of i million  or ii of eligible domestic accounts receivable 
as of december  and  respectively  no amounts under the working capital revolver were outstanding or available to us 
we may only draw on the revolving line of credit against eligible us domestic accounts receivable  which we would not expect to have prior to the launch of iluvien in the us therefore  the revolving line of credit  which expires in april  is not currently  and may never be  available to us 
amounts advanced under the working capital revolver will bear interest at an annual rate equal to silicon valley bank s prime rate plus with a rate floor of 
interest on the working capital revolver will be due monthly  with the balance due at the maturity date 
on the effective date  we paid to silicon valley bank an upfront fee of  in addition  if we terminate the working capital revolver prior to maturity  we will be required to pay to silicon valley bank a fee of  provided that such fee will be reduced by in the event such termination is in connection with an acquisition of us 
to secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed under the revolving loan agreement  we granted to silicon valley bank a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including our intellectual property  however  the lien on our intellectual property will be released if we meet certain financial conditions 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the revolving loan agreement and an increase to the applicable interest rate  and would permit silicon valley bank to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral under the revolving loan agreement 
we also agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber our intellectual property assets 
additionally  we must seek silicon valley bank s approval prior to the payment of any cash dividends to our stockholders 
financial operations overview we do not expect to generate any significant additional revenue until after the anticipated eu commercial launch of iluvien in  or unless or until we obtain regulatory approval in additional jurisdictions of  and commercialize  our product candidates or in license additional products that generate revenue 
in addition to generating revenue from product sales  we intend to seek to generate revenue from other sources such as upfront fees  milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the licensing of our product candidates and other intellectual property 
we expect any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the nature  timing and amount of any milestone payments we may receive from potential collaborative and strategic relationships  as well as revenue we may receive upon the sale of our products to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development expenses substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date related to our continuing operations have been related to the development of iluvien 
in the event the fda approves our nda for iluvien  we will owe an additional milestone payment of million to psivida 
we anticipate that we will incur additional research and development expenses in the future as we evaluate and possibly pursue the regulatory approval of iluvien in additional jurisdictions  the development of iluvien for additional indications  or develop additional product candidates 
we recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  
table of contents fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations cro in conjunction with independently monitoring clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with clinical trials  including all related fees such as investigator grants  patient screening  lab work and data compilation and statistical analysis  costs incurred with third parties related to the establishment of a commercially viable manufacturing process for our product candidates  costs related to production of clinical materials  including fees paid to contract manufacturers  costs related to upfront and milestone payments under in licensing agreements  costs related to compliance with fda  eu or other regulatory requirements  consulting fees paid to third parties involved in research and development activities  and costs related to stock options or other stock based compensation granted to personnel in development functions 
we expense both internal and external development costs as they are incurred 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future technical  preclinical and clinical development programs 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in terms of both their timing and total cost to completion 
we expect to continue to develop stable formulations of our product candidates  test such formulations in preclinical studies for toxicology  safety and efficacy and to conduct clinical trials for each product candidate 
we anticipate funding clinical trials ourselves  but we may engage collaboration partners at certain stages of clinical development 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs 
completion of clinical trials by us or our future collaborators may take several years or more  the length of time generally varying with the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to but not limited to the following the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll eligible patients  the number of patients that participate in the trials  the number of doses that patients receive  the drop out or discontinuation rates of patients  the duration of patient follow up  the phase of development the product candidate is in  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis 
our most advanced product candidate is iluvien  which has received marketing authorization in the united kingdom  austria  france  germany  portugal  and spain  and has been recommended for marketing authorization in italy  for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic dme considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies 
iluvien has not been approved in the us by the fda or in any jurisdiction other than as set forth above 
in order to grant marketing approval  a health authority such as the fda or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical and preclinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates with an appropriate benefit to risk profile relevant to a particular indication  and that the product can be manufactured under current good manufacturing practice cgmp in a reproducible manner to deliver the product s intended performance in terms of its stability  quality  purity and potency 
until our submissions are reviewed by health authorities  there is no way to predict the outcome of their review 
even if the clinical studies meet their predetermined primary endpoints  and a registration dossier is accepted for filing  a health authority could still determine that an appropriate benefit to risk relationship does not exist for the indication that we are seeking 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such 
table of contents arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions  including finance  accounting and human resources 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with the corporate governance  internal control and similar requirements applicable to public companies 
marketing expenses marketing expenses consist primarily of professional fees and compensation for employees to assess the commercial opportunity of and developing market awareness and launch plans for iluvien 
other costs include professional fees associated with developing plans for our product candidates and maintaining public relations 
we expect significant increases in our marketing and selling expenses as we prepare for the commercialization of iluvien in the eu 
we plan to proceed with the direct commercialization of iluvien in germany  the united kingdom and france in currently we are engaged  with the assistance of local consultants  in the pricing and reimbursement process in these countries and are developing related market access plans 
we have hired an alimera european management team and  through outsourced third party providers  are developing an in country commercial infrastructure of approximately thirty people in management and the field combined including sales representatives  market access personnel and medical science liaisons 
in preparation for a potential us commercial launch of iluvien  we began recruiting sales and marketing infrastructure personnel with extensive ophthalmic based sales experience in the fourth quarter of we hired our marketing and managed markets directors  three sales directors and our four field based managed markets managers but did not add the personnel and incur the costs of hiring and training an internal sales force 
we entered into a relationship with oncall llc  a contract sales force company  and would have utilized their employees to act as our sales representatives if we had received approval of the iluvien nda from the fda 
due to the receipt of the second crl  we eliminated our sales management team and field based managed markets managers  as well as certain general and administrative functions 
we incurred  of personnel and severance costs related to this workforce reduction in december of of which  was payable at december  all amounts due at december  were paid to affected employees during the year ended december  in november  we entered into an agreement with quintiles commercial europe limited 
under the agreement  quintiles commercial europe limited and its affiliates collectively  quintiles commercial will provide certain services to us in relation to the commercialization of iluvien  in certain countries in europe under subsequent project orders 
such services may include marketing  brand management  sales promotion and detailing  market access  pricing and reimbursement support  regulatory  medical science liaison and communications and or other advisory services 
currently we have entered into six project orders with quintiles commercial for the provision of sales  marketing  management  market access and medical science personnel in germany  the united kingdom and france 
under these project orders quintiles commercial currently employs persons fully dedicated to alimera and expects this number to grow to by december quintiles commercial also employs persons partially dedicated to alimera in germany  the united kingdom and france 
in accordance with the terms of these project orders  we will incur approximately million in costs with quintiles commercial through for the year ended december   we incurred million of expense associated with this agreement 
at december   million is included in outsourced services payable and million is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our accompanying consolidated financial statements in association with these project orders 
interest and other income interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
interest expense in october  we drew the initial tranche of million on our term loan from silicon valley bank and midcap financial llp which accrues interest at the rate of per annum and is payable monthly 

table of contents change in fair value of derivative warrant liability warrants to purchase our series a convertible preferred stock or common stock that do not meet the requirements for classification as equity  in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  are classified as liabilities 
we record these derivative financial instruments as liabilities in our balance sheet measured at their fair value 
we record the changes in fair value of such instruments as non cash gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
basic and diluted net loss applicable to common stockholders per common share we calculated net loss per share in accordance with asc  earning per share 
we had a net loss for all periods presented  accordingly  the inclusion of common stock options and warrants would be anti dilutive 
dilutive common stock equivalents would include the dilutive effect of convertible securities  common stock options  warrants for convertible securities and warrants for common stock equivalents 
potentially dilutive weighted average common stock equivalents totaled approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for all periods of net loss because of their anti dilutive effect 
therefore  for the years ended december  and  the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted loss per share are the same 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
clinical trial prepaid and accrued expenses we record prepaid assets and accrued liabilities related to clinical trials associated with cros  clinical trial investigators and other vendors based upon amounts paid and the estimated amount of work completed on each clinical trial 
the financial terms of agreements vary from vendor to vendor and may result in uneven payment flows 
as such  if we have advanced funds exceeding our estimate of the work completed  we record a prepaid asset 
if our estimate of the work completed exceeds the amount paid  an accrued liability is recorded 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates 
our estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with our cros and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activities becomes known 
to date  we have not experienced material changes in these estimates 
additionally  we do not expect material adjustments to research and development expenses to result from changes in the nature and level of clinical trial activity and related expenses that are currently subject to estimation 
in the future  as we expand our clinical trial activities  we expect to have increased levels of research and development costs that will be subject to estimation 
research and development costs research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred  pursuant to asc  research and development 
costs to license technology to be used in our research and development that have not reached technological feasibility  defined as fda approval for our current product candidates  and have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
payments to licensors that relate to the achievement of preapproval development milestones are recorded as research and development expense when incurred 
stock based compensation we have stock option plans which provide for grants of stock options to employees  directors and consultants or other service providers to purchase shares of our common stock at exercise prices generally equal to the fair values of such stock at the dates of grant 
compensation cost is recognized for all share based awards based on the grant date fair value in accordance 
table of contents with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
we recognize the grant date fair value as compensation cost of employee stock based awards using the straight line method over the actual vesting period  adjusted for our estimates of forfeiture 
typically  we grant stock options with a requisite service period of four years from the grant date 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards 
we concluded that this was the most appropriate method by which to value our share based payment arrangements  but if any share based payment instruments should be granted for which the black scholes method does not meet the measurement objective as stated within asc  we will utilize a more appropriate method for valuing that instrument 
however  we do not believe that any instruments granted to date and accounted for under asc would require a method other than the black scholes method 
our determination of the fair market value of share based payment awards on the grant date using option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected price volatility and option life 
for the calculation of expected volatility  because we lack significant company specific historical and implied volatility information  we estimate our volatility by utilizing an average of volatilities of publicly traded companies  including our own  deemed similar to us in terms of product composition  stage of lifecycle  capitalization and scope of operations 
we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using this same index until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available 
to estimate the expected term  we utilize the simplified method for plain vanilla options as discussed within the securities and exchange commission s sec statement of accounting bulletin sab we believe that all factors listed within sab as pre requisites for utilizing the simplified method are true for us and for our share based payment arrangements 
we intend to utilize the simplified method for the foreseeable future until more detailed information about exercise behavior will be more widely available 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes 
we evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis 
significant management judgment is involved in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
due to uncertainties with respect to the realization of our deferred tax assets due to our history of operating losses  a valuation allowance has been established against our deferred tax asset balances to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as a result we have fully reserved against the deferred tax asset balances 
the valuation allowances are based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  a change in the valuation allowance may be needed  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
our deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss nol carry forwards 
at december  we had federal nol carry forwards of approximately million and state nol carry forwards of approximately million  respectively  that are available to reduce future income otherwise taxable 
if not utilized  the federal nol carry forwards will expire at various dates between and and the state nol carry forwards will expire at various dates between and we periodically evaluate our nol carry forwards and whether certain changes in ownership have occurred that would limit our ability to utilize a portion of our nol carry forwards 
if it is determined that significant ownership changes have occurred since these nols were generated  we may be subject to annual limitations on the use of these nols under internal revenue code irc section or comparable provisions of state law 
the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock on october  constituted such a change in ownership 
we are currently performing a formal analysis of our nols in connection with irc section as a result of this change to determine the extent of the limitation of our nol carry forwards 
in the event that we were to determine that we are able to realize any of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
we believe that the most significant uncertainty that will impact the determination of our valuation allowance will be our estimation of the extent and timing of future net income  if any 
we considered our income tax positions for uncertainty in accordance with asc we believe our income tax filing positions and deductions are more likely than not of being sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position  therefore  we have not recorded asc liabilities 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense  respectively  in our statements of operations 
our tax years since remain subject to examination in georgia  tennessee  and on the federal level 
we do not anticipate any material changes to our uncertain tax positions within the next months 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  in thousands research and development expenses general and administrative expenses marketing expenses operating expenses interest and other income interest expense change in fair value of derivative warrant liability net loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by approximately  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases of million in costs related to a consultant engaged to assist with the continued pursuit of approval of iluvien in the us   in costs related to our third party reading center for additional analysis of photographs of the retina of patients of our fame study to be included in the response to the second crl from the fda and  in costs related to the physician utilization study which is being conducted to assess the safety and utility of the commercial version of the applicator for iluvien  offset by decreases of  in costs associated with terminating our medical science liaisons to engage with retinal specialists in the study of iluvien in the us   in costs associated with establishing manufacturing capabilities with our third party manufacturer for iluvien   in costs associated with certain types of nadph oxidase inhibitors which was terminated in as we terminated our license agreements with emory university   in costs associated with the cros of our fame study as the cros completed their work in and  in costs associated with our ancillary studies 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases of  in costs related to professional legal fees as we expanded our operations into the eu   in costs related to fulfilling the registration obligations associated with the series a convertible preferred stock financing and  in costs associated with recruiting an eu managing director to lead our expansion into the eu  offset by a decrease of  in salary expense as a result of our workforce reduction in the us initiated in late as a result of the issuance of the fda second crl 
marketing expenses

table of contents change in fair value of derivative warrant liability 
during the year ended december   we recognized a gain of approximately million related to the decrease in the fair value of our derivative warrant liability 
the change in fair value was primarily due to a decrease in the fair market value of our underlying common stock since the issuance date of the warrants 
liquidity and capital resources to date we have incurred recurring losses  negative cash flow from operations  and have accumulated a deficit of million from our inception through december  we have funded our operations through the public and private placement of common stock  preferred stock  warrants and convertible debt  the sale of certain assets of the non prescription business in which we were previously engaged  and certain debt facilities 
on october   we closed a preferred stock financing in which we sold units consisting of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of series a convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of million  prior to the payment of approximately  of related issuance costs 
in october  we obtained a million senior secured credit facility credit facility to help fund our working capital requirements 
the credit facility consisted of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the lenders advanced million under the term loan in october to secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed under the credit facility  we granted to the lenders a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including our intellectual property  however  the lien on our intellectual property will be released if we meet certain financial conditions 
we also agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber our intellectual property assets 
in may  the credit facility was amended to increase the term loan to million  of which the remaining million would have been advanced following fda approval of iluvien  but no later than december  due to the issuance of the second crl by the fda in november regarding our nda for iluvien  the remaining million is no longer available to us 
additionally  we may only draw on the revolving line of credit against eligible us domestic accounts receivable  which we would not expect to have prior to the launch of iluvien in the us  if any 
therefore  the revolving line of credit  which expires in april  is not currently  and may never be  available to us 
on february   we received a letter from the lenders stating that the they reserve the right to assert that recent events  including the issuance of the second crl and a decrease in the market value of our public equity securities  may represent a material impairment of the value of the collateral under the loan agreements 
to date  the lenders have not made such an assertion  and in our opinion a material impairment of the value of the collateral has not occurred 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we plan to proceed with the direct commercialization of iluvien in germany  the united kingdom and france in we believe that we have sufficient funds available to fund our operations beyond the projected commercialization of iluvien in these eu countries 
we do not expect the generation of revenue until  and therefore do not expect to have positive cash flow from operations until  if at all 
if iluvien is not approved in additional jurisdictions or does not generate sufficient revenue  we may adjust our commercial plans so that it can continue to operate with our existing cash resources or seek to raise additional financing 
in the event additional financing is needed or desired  we may seek to fund our operations through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
we cannot be sure that additional financing from any of these sources will be available when needed or that  if available  the additional financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders especially in light of the current difficult financial environment 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result and the terms of any new equity securities may have a preference over our common stock 
if we attempt to raise additional funds through strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements  or the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to commercialize our product candidates or operate our business
