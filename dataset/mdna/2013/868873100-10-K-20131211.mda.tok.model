overview surmodics is a leading provider of surface modification and in vitro diagnostic technologies to the healthcare industry 
in fiscal  our business performance continued to be driven by growth from our medical device hydrophilic coatings royalty revenue  despite current coronary market declines faced by our customers  and from our in vitro diagnostics segment from existing products  new product launches as well as the addition of new diagnostic test kit manufacturer customers 
in fiscal our drug delivery royalty and reagent product revenue declined because of cordis s termination of its exclusivity arrangements under one of its license agreements with the company  notwithstanding increased revenues from customers that launched and expanded usage of licensed medical devices as well as continued activities with other medical device customers 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we report our results for the two reportable segments as follows the medical device unit  which is comprised of surface modification coating technologies to improve access  deliverability  and predictable deployment of medical devices  as well as drug delivery coating technologies to provide site specific drug delivery from the surface of a medical device  with end markets that include coronary  peripheral  and neurovascular  and urology  among others  and the in vitro diagnostics unit  which consists of component products and technologies for diagnostic immunoassay and molecular tests and biomedical research applications  with products that include protein stabilization reagents  substrates  antigens and surface coatings 
we made this determination based on how we manage our operations and the information provided to our chief operating decision maker who is our chief executive officer 
we derive our revenue from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our proprietary surface modification and device drug delivery technologies and in vitro diagnostic formats to customers  the vast majority typically in excess of of revenue in the royalties and license fees category is in the form of royalties  the sale of reagent chemicals to licensees and the sale of stabilization products  antigens  substrates and surface coatings to the diagnostic and biomedical research markets  and research and commercial development fees generated on customer projects 
revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our technologies  the timing of introductions of licensed products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers products  the number and activity level associated with customer development projects  the number and terms of new license agreements that are finalized  and the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to customers
