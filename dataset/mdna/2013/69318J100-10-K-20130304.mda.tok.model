item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
competition the direct marketing and sale of it products  including personal computers and related products  is highly competitive 
we compete with other direct marketers of it products  including cdw corporation and insight enterprises  inc  who are much larger than we are 
we also compete with certain product manufacturers that sell directly to customers as well as some of our own suppliers  such as apple  dell  hp  and lenovo  distributors that sell directly to certain customers  local and regional vars  various franchisers  office supply superstores  and national computer retailers  and companies with more extensive websites and commercial online networks 
additional competition may arise if other new methods of distribution  such as broadband electronic software distribution  emerge in the future 
we compete not only for customers  but also for favorable product allocations and cooperative advertising support from product manufacturers 
several of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources 
these and other factors related to our competitive position are discussed more fully in the overview of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
we believe that price  product selection and availability  and service and support are the most important competitive factors in our industry 
intellectual property rights our trademarks include pc connection  moredirect  govconnection  macconnection  cloud connection tm  and their related logos  everything overnight  the connection  raccoon character  service connection  healthconnection  proconnection  traxx  graphics connection  education connection  get connected  connect  your brands  your way  next day  and webspoc 
we intend to 
table of contents use and protect these and our other marks  as we deem necessary 
we believe our trademarks have significant value and are an important factor in the marketing of our products 
we do not maintain a traditional research and development group  but we work closely with computer product manufacturers and other technology developers to stay abreast of the latest developments in computer technology  with respect to the products we both sell and use 
work force as of december   we employed  persons full time equivalent  of whom including management and support personnel were engaged in sales related activities  were engaged in providing it services and customer service and support  were engaged in purchasing  marketing  and distribution related activities  were engaged in the operation and development of management information systems  and were engaged in administrative and finance functions 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
our employees are not represented by a labor union  and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage 
item a 
risk factors statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k that are not based on historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act 
these forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections and the beliefs and assumptions of management including  without limitation  our expectations with regard to the industry s rapid technological change and exposure to inventory obsolescence  availability and allocations of goods  reliance on vendor support and relationships  competitive risks  pricing risks  and the overall level of economic activity and the level of business investment in information technology products 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  could  expect  estimate  anticipate  continue  or similar terms  variations of such terms  or the negative of those terms 
we cannot assure investors that our assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward looking statements 
such factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors discussed below 
we undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations would likely suffer 
the economic instability and the unrest in the financial markets may adversely affect our business and reduce our operating results 
our business has been affected by changes in economic conditions that are outside of our control  including reductions in business investment  loss of consumer confidence  and fiscal uncertainty at both federal and state government levels 
although businesses have increased their it spending in recent years  considerable uncertainty exists regarding expected economic conditions  and future delays or reductions in it spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our financial results 
it is difficult to predict how long the economic instability and unrest in the financial markets will continue  the extent  if any  to which they may deteriorate  and to which our business may be adversely affected 
however  if it spending should again decline  we are likely to experience an adverse impact  which may be material on our business and our results of operations 

table of contents we have experienced variability in sales  and there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain profitable operations 
several factors have caused our results of operations to fluctuate and we expect some of these fluctuations to continue on a quarterly basis 
causes of these fluctuations include shifts in customer demand that affect our distribution models  including demand for total solutions  loss of customers to competitors  industry shipments of new products or upgrades  changes in overall demand and timing of product shipments related to government spending  changes in vendor distribution of products  changes in our product offerings and in merchandise returns  the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in shipping  printing  postage  and paper costs  fluctuations in response rates  and adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution  or shipping 
our results also may vary based on our ability to manage personnel levels in response to fluctuations in revenue 
we base personnel levels and other operating expenditures on sales forecasts 
if our revenues do not meet anticipated levels in the future  we may not be able to reduce our staffing levels and operating expenses in a timely manner to avoid significant losses from operations 
we face many competitive risks 
the direct marketing industry and the computer products retail business  in particular  are highly competitive 
we compete with other direct marketers of hardware and software and computer related products  including cdw corporation and insight enterprises  inc  who are much larger than we are 
certain hardware and software vendors  such as apple  dell  lenovo  and hp  who provide products to us  also sell their products directly to end users through their own catalogs  stores  and via the internet 
we also compete with computer retail stores and websites  who are increasingly selling to business customers and may become a significant competitor 
we compete not only for customers  but also for advertising support from personal computer product manufacturers 
some of our competitors have larger customer bases and greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities  and adopt pricing policies that are more aggressive than ours 
we expect competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry 
in addition  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to compete effectively against our current or future competitors 
if we encounter new competition or fail to compete effectively against our competitors  our business may be harmed 

table of contents we face and will continue to face significant price competition 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in our industry  and we expect pricing pressures to escalate should economic conditions deteriorate 
an increase in price competition could result in a reduction of our profit margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions  or otherwise 
also  our sales of it hardware products generally result in lower profit margins than those associated with software products 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of our market share  reduced sales  and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors 
some product manufacturers and distributors provide us with incentives such as supplier reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
the increasingly competitive computer hardware market has already resulted in the following reduction or elimination of some of these incentive programs  more restrictive price protection and other terms  and reduced advertising allowances and incentives  in some cases 
many product suppliers provide us with advertising allowances  and in exchange  we feature their products in our catalogs and other marketing vehicles 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expenses 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of sales or inventory 
in the past  we have experienced a decrease in the level of vendor consideration available to us from certain manufacturers 
the level of such consideration we receive from some manufacturers may decline in the future 
such a decline could decrease our gross profit and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 
virtualization of it resources and applications  including networks  servers  applications  and data storage may disrupt or alter our traditional distribution models 
our customers can access  through a cloud platform  business critical solutions without the significant initial capital investment required for dedicated infrastructure 
migrating to a cloud based environment increases the risk of data security  connectivity  and performance for our customers 
there can be no assurances that we can mitigate these risks for our customers  or that we will be able to effectively compete using these virtual distribution models 
our inability to compete effectively with current or future virtual distribution model competitors  or adapt to a cloud based environment  could have a material  adverse effect on our business 
our business could be materially adversely affected by any failure  interruption  or security lapse of our information technology systems 
our ability to effectively manage our business depends significantly on our information systems and infrastructure 
the failure of our current systems  or future upgrades  to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems  could result in transaction errors  processing inefficiencies  and the loss of sales and customers  disrupting our business 
in addition  cybersecurity threats are evolving and include  but are not limited to  malicious software  attempts to gain unauthorized access to company or customer data  denial of service attacks  the processing of fraudulent transactions and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems  unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data 
although we have in place various processes  procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats  there can be no assurance that these will be sufficient to prevent a material security threat 
if any of these events were to materialize  they could lead to disruption of our operations or loss of sensitive information as well as subject us to regulatory actions  litigation  or damage to our reputation  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents should our financial performance not meet expectations and our stock price trade below current levels  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings for impairment of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment each year and more frequently if potential impairment indicators arise 
although the fair value of goodwill held by our large account reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value at our annual impairment test  should the financial performance of the reporting unit not meet expectations due to the economy or otherwise  we would likely adjust downward its expected future operating results and cash flows 
such adjustment may result in a determination that the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
this determination may in turn require that we record a significant non cash charge to earnings to reduce the million aggregate carrying amount of goodwill held by our large account reporting unit  resulting in a negative effect on our results of operations 
the failure to comply with our public sector contracts could result in  among other things  fines or liabilities 
revenues from the public sector segment are derived from sales to federal  state  and local government departments and agencies  as well as to educational institutions  through various contracts and open market sales 
government contracting is a highly regulated area 
noncompliance with government procurement regulations or contract provisions could result in civil  criminal  and administrative liability  including substantial monetary fines or damages  termination of government contracts  and suspension  debarment  or ineligibility from doing business with the government 
our current arrangements with these government agencies allow them to cancel orders with little or no notice and do not require them to purchase products from us in the future 
the effect of any of these possible actions by any government department or agency could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we could experience internet and other system failures which would interfere with our ability to process orders 
we depend on the accuracy and proper use of our management information systems  including our telephone system 
many of our key functions depend on the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by our management information systems  including our ability to purchase  sell  and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  our ability to manage inventory and accounts receivable collection  and our ability to maintain operations 
our management information systems require continual upgrades to most effectively manage our operations and customer database 
although we maintain some redundant systems  with full data backup  our primary computer and telecommunications hardware is located in a single facility in new hampshire  and a substantial interruption in our management information systems or in our telephone communication systems  including those resulting from extreme weather and natural disasters  as well as power loss  telecommunications failure  or similar events  would substantially hinder our ability to process customer orders and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we acquire a majority of our products for resale from a limited number of vendors 
the loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and increasingly indirectly through distributors and other sources 
the five vendors supplying the greatest amount of goods to us constituted   and of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and  respectively 
among these five vendors  purchases from ingram represented   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
purchases from synnex corporation represented   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
purchases from tech data 
table of contents corporation represented   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
purchases from hp represented   and of our total product purchases in   and  respectively 
no other vendor supplied more than of our total product purchases in the years ended december    or if we were unable to acquire products from ingram  synnex  tech data  or hp  we could experience a short term disruption in the availability of products  and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
products manufactured by hp represented of our net sales in and of our net sales in both and we believe that in the event we experience either a short term or permanent disruption of supply of hp products  such disruption would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
substantially all of our contracts and arrangements with our vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or us without notice or upon short notice 
most of our product vendors provide us with trade credit  of which the net amount outstanding at december  was million 
termination  interruption  or contraction of relationships with our vendors  including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
some product manufacturers either do not permit us to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to direct marketers such as us 
an element of our business strategy is to continue increasing our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
the availability of certain desired products  especially in the direct marketing channel  has been constrained in the past 
we could experience a material adverse effect to our business if we are unable to source first to market purchases or similar opportunities  or if significant availability constraints reoccur 
we are exposed to inventory obsolescence due to the rapid technological changes occurring in the personal computer industry 
the market for personal computer products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
our success depends in large part on our ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of customers in that marketplace 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts  we have and may continue to carry increased inventory levels of certain products 
by so doing  we are subject to the increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
also  in order to implement our business strategy  we intend to continue  among other things  placing larger than typical inventory stocking orders of selected products and increasing our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
we may also  from time to time  make large inventory purchases of certain end of life products  which would increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in addition  we sometimes acquire special purchase products without return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory 
manufacturers have limited return rights and have taken steps to reduce their inventory exposure by supporting configure to order programs authorizing distributors and resellers to assemble computer hardware under the manufacturers brands 
these actions reduce the costs to manufacturers and shift the burden of inventory risk to resellers like us  which could negatively impact our business 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executives and other key management personnel 
the competition for qualified management personnel in the computer products industry is very intense  and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on our business 
our success and plans for future growth will also depend on our ability to hire  train  and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including sales representatives and technical support personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  train  and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve our business objectives 

table of contents the methods of distributing it products are changing  and such changes may negatively impact us and our business 
the manner in which it hardware and software are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as online shopping services  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
some of our vendors  including apple  dell  hp  and lenovo  currently sell some of their products directly to end users and have stated their intentions to increase the level of such direct sales 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend heavily on third party shippers to deliver our products to customers 
many of our customers elect to have their purchases shipped by an interstate common carrier  such as ups or fedex corporation 
a strike or other interruption in service by these shippers could adversely affect our ability to market or deliver products to customers on a timely basis 
natural disasters  terrorism  and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our business 
natural disasters  terrorism  and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy  and thus could have a negative effect on the company  its suppliers  logistics providers  manufacturing vendors  and customers 
our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages  nuclear power plant accidents  terrorist attacks  and other hostile acts  and other events beyond our control 
such events could decrease demand for our products  make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services or products to our customers  or to receive products from our suppliers  and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 
in the event of a natural disaster  significant recovery time and substantial expenditures could be required to resume operations and our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we may experience potential increases in shipping  paper  and postage costs  which may adversely affect our business if we are not able to pass such increases on to our customers 
shipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of our business 
increases in postal or shipping rates could significantly impact the cost of shipping customer orders and mailing our catalogs 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically  and we have no control over future increases 
we have a long term contract with ups  and believe that we have negotiated favorable shipping rates with our carriers 
we generally invoice customers for shipping and handling charges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on to our customers the full cost  including any future increases in the cost  of commercial delivery services 
we also incur substantial paper and postage costs related to our marketing activities  including producing and mailing our catalogs 
paper prices historically have been cyclical  and we have experienced substantial increases in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations  particularly if we cannot pass on such increases to our customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
we rely on the continued development of electronic commerce and internet infrastructure development 
we have had an increasing level of sales made via the internet in part because of the growing use and acceptance of the internet by end users 
sales of computer products via the internet represent a significant portion 
table of contents of overall computer product sales 
growth of our internet sales is dependent on potential customers using the internet in addition to traditional means of commerce to purchase products 
we cannot accurately predict the rate at which they will do so 
our success in growing our internet business will depend in large part upon our development of an increasingly sophisticated infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
if the number of internet users or their use of internet resources continues to grow rapidly  such growth may impact the performance of our existing internet infrastructure 
additionally  our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to customers and to increase the scope of such services ultimately is limited by  and reliant upon  the sophistication  speed  reliability  and cost effectiveness of the networks operated by third parties  and these networks may not continue to be developed or be available at prices consistent with our required business model 
also  increasing customer sophistication requires that we provide additional website features and functionality in order to be competitive in the marketplace and maintain market share 
we face uncertainties relating to unclaimed property and the collection of state sales and use tax 
we collect and remit sales and use taxes in states in which we have either voluntarily registered or have a physical presence 
various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales and use taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents 
many states have adopted rules that require companies and their affiliates to register in those states as a condition of doing business with those state agencies 
our three sales companies are registered in substantially all states  however  if a state were to determine that our earlier contacts with that state exceeded the constitutionally permitted contacts  the state could assess a tax liability relating to our prior year sales 
a comprehensive multi state unclaimed property audit continues to be in process  and total accruals for unclaimed property aggregated million at december  privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance may materially adversely affect our business 
we mail catalogs and other promotional materials to names in our customer database and to potential customers whose names we obtain from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
public concern regarding the protection of personal information has subjected the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information to increased scrutiny 
legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting the use of rented or exchanged mailing lists could negatively affect our business 
we are controlled by two principal stockholders 
patricia gallup and david hall  our two principal stockholders  beneficially own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of december  because of their beneficial stock ownership  these stockholders can continue to elect the members of the board of directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting 
similarly  such stockholders can control decisions to adopt  amend  or repeal our charter and our bylaws  or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders and prevent a takeover of us by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party  which could deprive our stockholders of a control premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of our company 
such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our public stockholders 
in connection with our initial public offering  the principal stockholders placed substantially all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them into a voting trust  pursuant to which they are required to agree as to the manner of voting such shares in order for the shares to be voted 
such provisions could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock

unresolved staff comments none 

table of contents item properties in november  we entered into a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters and telemarketing center located at milford road  merrimack  new hampshire  with an affiliated entity  g h post  which is related to us through common ownership 
the total lease is valued at approximately million  based upon an independent property appraisal obtained at the date of lease  and interest is calculated at an annual rate of 
the lease  as amended  requires us to pay our proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges as either additional rent or directly to third parties and also to pay insurance premiums for the leased property 
we have the option to renew the lease for two additional terms of five years each 
the lease has been recorded as a capital lease in the financial statements 
in august  we entered into a lease agreement with g h post  which is related to us through common ownership  for an office facility adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of ten years and provides us with an option to renew the lease for two additional two year terms  at the then comparable market rate 
the lease requires us to pay our proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges as either additional rent or directly to third parties and also to pay insurance premiums for the leased property 
the lease has been recorded as an operating lease in the financial statements 
we also lease  square feet in two facilities in wilmington  ohio  which houses our distribution and order fulfillment operations

we also operate sales and support offices in keene and portsmouth  new hampshire  marlborough  massachusetts  rockville  maryland  dakota dunes  south dakota  boca raton  florida  and itasca  illinois  and lease facilities at these locations 
leasehold improvements associated with these properties are amortized over the terms of the leases or their useful lives  whichever is shorter 
we believe that existing or otherwise available distribution facilities in wilmington  ohio will be sufficient to support our anticipated needs through the next twelve months and beyond 
item legal proceedings we are subject to audits by states on sales and income taxes  unclaimed property  employment matters  and other assessments 
a comprehensive multi state unclaimed property audit continues to be in progress  and total accruals for unclaimed property aggregated million at december  while management believes that known and estimated unclaimed property liabilities have been adequately provided for  it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of such audits  as no formal assessments have yet been received 
additional liabilities for this or any other audit could be asserted  and such outcome could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including patent infringement claims  which have arisen during the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such matters is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

share repurchase authorization on march   our board of directors authorized the spending of up to million to repurchase our common stock 
we consider block repurchases directly from larger shareholders  as well as open market purchases  in carrying out our ongoing stock repurchase program 
in  we repurchased  shares for million  consisting of  shares under our board approved repurchase program and a block purchase not made under such program of  shares for million from two of our primary shareholders 
as of december   we have repurchased an aggregate of  shares for million under our board approved repurchase program 
the maximum approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the board authorized program is million 
in addition to the repurchases discussed above  during the year ended december   we issued upon the vesting of restricted stock  shares from treasury with a fair value of million and have reflected the net remaining balance of treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the vesting  we withheld  shares  having an aggregate fair value of million  to satisfy related payroll tax obligations 
these net share settlements had the economic effect of repurchases of common stock as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting 
the shares withheld were returned to treasury but did not apply against authorized repurchase limits under our board of directors authorization

however  certain manufacturers have on multiple occasions attempted to sell directly to our customers  and in some cases  have restricted our ability to sell their products directly to certain customers  thereby attempting to eliminate our role 
we believe that the success of these direct sales efforts by suppliers will depend on their ability to meet our customers ongoing demands and provide objective  unbiased solutions to meet their needs 
we believe more of our customers are seeking total it solutions  rather than simply the acquisition of specific it products 
our advantage is our ability to be product neutral and provide a broader combination of products  services  and advice tailored to customer needs 
by providing customers with customized solutions from a variety of manufacturers  we believe we can mitigate the negative impact of continued direct sales initiatives from individual manufacturers 
through the formation of our proconnection services group  and more recently  our acquisition of valcom  we are able to provide customers complete it solutions  from identifying their needs  to designing  developing  and managing the integration of products and services to implement their it projects 
such service offerings carry higher margins than traditional product sales 
additionally  the technical certifications of our service engineers permit us to offer higher end  more complex products that generally carry higher gross margins 
we expect these service offerings and technical certifications to continue to play a role in sales generation and improve gross margins in this competitive environment 
market conditions and technology advances significantly affect the demand for our products and services 
virtual delivery of software products and advanced internet technology providing customers enhanced functionality have substantially increased customer expectations  requiring us to invest more heavily in our own it development to meet these new demands 
this investment includes significant planned expenditures to update our websites  as buying trends change and electronic commerce continues to grow 

table of contents the primary challenges we continue to face in effectively managing our business are increasing our revenues while at the same time maintaining or improving our gross margin in all three segments  recruiting  retaining  and improving the productivity of our sales personnel  and effectively controlling our sg a expenses while making major investments in our it systems and solution selling personnel 
to support future growth  we are expanding our it solution business  which requires the addition of highly skilled service engineers 
we are still in the early stages of this multi year initiative  and  although we expect to realize the ultimate benefit of higher margin service revenues  we believe that our sg a expenses will increase significantly as we add service engineers 
if our service revenues do not grow enough to offset the cost of these headcount additions  our operating results may decline 
to operate more efficiently  we have undertaken a comprehensive review and assessment of our entire business software needs 
that review and assessment includes the review of commercially available software that meets  or can be configured to meet  those needs better than our existing software 
as of december   we have capitalized million of software and integration costs for the initial phase of this software project 
while we have not yet finalized our decisions regarding to what extent additional software will be acquired and implemented beyond the mdm software we have acquired to date  we expect to increase our capital investments in our it infrastructure in the next three years  which will also likely increase sg a expenses as the assets are placed into service and depreciated

liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been internally generated funds from operations and borrowings under our bank line of credit 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of working capital for operational needs  capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business  repurchases of common stock for treasury  and as opportunities arise  possible acquisitions of new businesses 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit and inventory trade credit agreements  will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditure  and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months 
aside from our expenditures on the customer mdm software initiative  we expect our capital needs for to consist primarily of capital expenditures of to million and payments on capital lease and other contractual obligations of approximately million 
in addition  we have undertaken a comprehensive review and assessment of our entire business software needs  including commercially available software that meets  or can be configured to meet  those needs better than our existing software 
while we have not finalized our decisions regarding to what extent new software will be acquired and implemented beyond the customer mdm software we have acquired to date  the additional capital costs of such a project  if fully implemented  would likely exceed million over the next three years 
we have capitalized million of software and integration costs for the customer mdm software project  the first stage of our overall it initiative  as of december  we expect to meet our cash requirements for through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and borrowings on our bank line of credit  as follows cash on hand 
at december   we had million in unrestricted cash 
cash generated from operations 
we expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by generating earnings and mitigating net changes in inventories and receivables with changes in payables to generate a positive cash flow 
credit facilities 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding against our million bank line of credit  which is available until february  accordingly  our entire line of credit was available for borrowing at december  this line of credit can be increased  at our option  to million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank 
borrowings are  however  limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements  as described more fully below 

table of contents our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations at this time  if demand for it products declines  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected

operating cash flow in resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization as well as decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
accounts receivable decreased year over year by million due to improved collection efforts as evidenced by our lower days sales outstanding  which decreased to days at december   from days at december  inventory decreased year over year by million in due to management efforts to reduce stocking levels 
inventory days  which measure the average number of days goods remain in inventory before being sold  decreased to days at december  from days at the prior year end 
operating activities in were a use of cash as accounts receivables increased by million  and more than offset net income before depreciation and a decrease in accounts payable 
in  increases in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in accounts payable offset net income before depreciation and amortization as net operating activities represented a million use of cash 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence  or earlier when favorable cash discounts are offered 
this balance will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under inventory trade credit agreements we use to finance our purchase of certain inventory  secured by the inventory which is financed 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
cash used for investing activities decreased by million in compared to due to lower capital expenditures in and our million acquisition of valcom in cash used to purchase property and equipment less proceeds from the sale of equipment amounted to million in  compared to million in  and million in these expenditures were primarily for computer equipment and capitalized internally developed software in connection with the it initiative referred to above

in addition  we have the option to increase the facility by an additional million to meet additional borrowing requirements 
our credit facility is subject to certain covenant requirements which are described below under factors affecting sources of liquidity 
borrowings under the credit facility during were minimal in amount and duration and were utilized to facilitate short term working capital requirements in the first quarter of cash receipts are automatically applied against any outstanding borrowings 
any excess cash on account may either remain on account to generate earned credits to offset up to of cash management fees  or may be invested in short term qualified investments 
borrowings under the line of credit are classified as current 
at december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
inventory trade credit agreements 
we have additional security agreements with two financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions 
these agreements allow a collateralized first position in certain branded products inventory financed by these financial institutions 
although the agreements provide for up to financing on the purchase price  up to an aggregate of million  any outstanding financing must be fully secured by available inventory 
we do not pay any interest or discount fees on such inventory financing  such costs are borne by the suppliers as an incentive for us to purchase their products 
amounts outstanding under such facilities  equal to million as of december   are recorded in accounts payable  and the inventory financed is classified as inventory on the consolidated balance sheet

table of contents capital leases 
we have a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters with an affiliated company related through common ownership  which expires in november  and we have the option to renew the lease for two additional terms of five years each 
in addition to the rent payable under the facility lease  we are required to pay real estate taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
operating leases 
we also lease facilities from our principal stockholders and facilities and equipment from third parties under non cancelable operating leases 
see contractual obligations above for lease commitments under these leases 
sports marketing commitments 
we have entered into multi year sponsorship agreements with the new england patriots and the boston red sox that extend to and  respectively 
these agreements  which grant us various marketing rights and seating arrangements  require annual payments aggregating from million to million per year 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies  timely collection of our customer receivables  and management of our inventory levels 
bank line of credit 
our bank line of credit extends until february and is collateralized by our receivables 
as of december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions including restrictions on additional debt  guarantees  and other distributions  investments  and liens with which we and all of our subsidiaries must comply 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default and could prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit 
this credit facility contains two financial tests the funded debt ratio defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter  divided by the consolidated adjusted ebitda for the trailing four quarters must not be more than to we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility during the fourth quarter of  and accordingly  the funded debt ratio did not limit potential borrowings as of december  future decreases in our consolidated adjusted ebitda  however  could limit our potential borrowings under the credit facility 
minimum consolidated net worth must be at least million  plus of consolidated net income for each quarter  beginning with the quarter ended march  loss quarters not counted 
such amount was calculated at december   as million  whereas our actual consolidated stockholders equity at this date was million 
inventory trade credit agreements 
these agreements contain similar financial ratios and operational covenants and restrictions as those contained in our bank line of credit described above 
such agreements also contain cross default provisions whereby a default under the bank agreement would also constitute a default under these agreements 
financing under these agreements is limited to the purchase of specific branded products from authorized suppliers  and amounts outstanding must be fully collateralized by inventories of those products on hand 
capital markets 
our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the information technology industry  our financial performance and stock price  and the state of the capital markets 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy has been defined as one that is both important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
further  critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
because we either i have a general practice of covering customer losses while products are in transit despite title transferring at the point of shipment or ii have fob destination shipping terms specifically set out in our arrangements with federal agencies and certain commercial customers  delivery is deemed to have occurred at the point in time when the product is received by the customer 
we use information regarding shipments at or near the end of the reporting period to estimate the products that have not reached the destination and recognize those revenues in the following period 
this process requires us to make estimates of product that is in transit at the reporting date 
these estimates are derived from current and historic shipping documentation and the volume of sales 
the impact of the deferral of these revenues has not been material in the periods presented 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise 
revenue is recognized at delivery and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on significant historical experience and record our sales reserves as a reduction of revenues and either as offsets to accounts receivable or  for customers who have already paid  as credits to accrued expenses 
at december   we recorded sales reserves of million and million as components of accounts receivable and accrued expenses  respectively for each of the years ended december  and all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling  if any  represent revenues earned for the goods provided  and these amounts have been classified as net sales 
costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales 
sales are reported net of sales  use  or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities 
we use our own engineering personnel in projects involving the design and installation of systems and networks  and we also engage third party service providers to perform warranty maintenance  implementations  asset disposals  and other services 
we evaluate such engagements to determine whether we or the third party assumes the general risk and reward of ownership in these transactions 
for those transactions in which we do not assume the risk and reward but instead act as an agent  we recognize the transaction revenue on a net basis 
under net sales recognition  we recognize the cost of the third party as a reduction to the selling price  and accordingly  report as revenue only our gross profit earned on the transaction 
in those engagements in which we are the principal and primary obligor  we report the sale on a gross basis  and the cost of the service provider is recognized in cost of goods sold 
similarly  we recognize revenue from agency sales transactions on a net sales basis 
in agency sales transactions  we facilitate product sales by equipment and software manufacturers directly to our customers and receive agency  or referral  fees for such transactions 
we do not take title to the products or assume any maintenance or return obligations in these transactions  title is passed directly from the supplier to our customer 

table of contents amounts recognized on a net basis included in net sales for such third party services and agency sales transactions were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
although service revenues represent a small percentage of our consolidated revenues  we offer a wide range of services  including design  installation  configuration  and other services performed by our personnel and third party providers 
in certain revenue arrangements  our contracts require that we provide multiple units of hardware  software  or services deliverables 
under these multiple element arrangements  each service performed and product delivered is considered a separate deliverable and qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the underlying services and products 
if we were to enter into a multiple element arrangement in which vendor specific objective evidence was not available  we would utilize third party evidence to allocate the selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence was available  we would estimate the selling price based on market price and company specific factors 
revenue is recognized when the product or service is delivered  consistent with our general revenue recognition policy 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers current creditworthiness 
our allowance is generally computed by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  or if we noted there was a lengthening of the timing of the settlement of receivables that was symptomatic of a general deterioration in the ability of our customers to pay  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would negatively impact our earnings 
our cash flows would be impacted to the extent that receivables could not be collected 
in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from our vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  a change in estimates could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of customer receivables and vendor supplier receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of a customer  vendor information  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluations are incorrect  we may incur additional charges in the future on our consolidated statements of operations 
our trade receivables are charged off in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously charged are recorded when received 
write offs of customer and vendor receivables totaled million for both and vendor allowances we receive allowances from merchandise vendors for price protections  discounts  product rebates  and other programs 
these allowances are treated as a reduction of the vendor s prices and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory  as applicable 
we also receive vendor co op advertising funding for our catalogs and other programs 
vendors have the ability to place advertisements in the catalogs or fund other advertising activities for which we receive advertising allowances 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of the underlying incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expense on the consolidated statements of income 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of sales or inventory 
our vendor partners generally consolidate their funding of advertising and other marketing programs  and as a result  we classify substantially all vendor allowances as a reduction of cost of inventory purchases rather than a reduction of advertising expense 

table of contents inventories inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems  and peripheral equipment are stated at cost determined under a weighted average cost method which approximates the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving  and non saleable inventory  based primarily on management s forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions  which could negatively impact our earnings 
our obsolescence charges have ranged between million and million per annum 
historically  there have been no unusual charges precipitated by specific technological or forecast issues 
value of goodwill and long lived assets  including intangibles we carry a variety of long lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
these are all currently classified as held for use 
these include property and equipment  identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
an impairment review is undertaken on an annual basis for goodwill  and on an event driven basis for all long lived assets including indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows from such assets may be diminished 
we have historically reviewed the carrying value of all these assets based partly on our projections of anticipated cash flows projections which are  in part  dependent upon anticipated market conditions  operational performance  and legal status 
any impairment charge that is recorded negatively impacts our earnings 
cash flows are generally not impacted 
we complete our annual impairment test of goodwill on the first day of each year 
this is a two step test that requires  under the first step  that we determine the fair value of the reporting unit holding such assets and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis using forward looking projections of the reporting unit s future operating results  as well as consideration of market valuation approaches 
our large account segment holds million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit was significantly in excess of its respective carrying value  and accordingly we did not identify any impairment in while we believe that our estimates of fair value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially affect our valuations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those remaining assets in our large account segment 
please see note  goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of the significant assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis 
inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread or the prime rate 
we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material
