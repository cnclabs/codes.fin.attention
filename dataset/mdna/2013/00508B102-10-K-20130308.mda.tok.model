this md a contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations  beliefs and strategies and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the risk factors section 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements

our business general actuate software corporation was incorporated in november in the state of california and reincorporated in the state of delaware in july as actuate corporation we  actuate or the company 
actuate provides software and services to develop and deploy custom business intelligence  analytics  big data  performance management and customer communications management applications that deliver rich interactive content that improve customer loyalty and corporate performance 
applications built on actuate s open source based platform are designed to provide all stakeholders inside and outside the firewall  including employees  customers  partners and citizens with information that they can easily access and understand to maximize revenue  cut costs  improve customer satisfaction  streamline operations  create competitive advantage and make better decisions 
our goal is to ensure that all users can use decision making information in their day to day activities  opening up completely new avenues for improving corporate performance 
december  in thousands financial summary total revenues total operating expenses income from operations operating margins despite the ongoing global economic uncertainty  we have continued to achieve profitability and positive cash flows during the year 
nevertheless  our business model and longer term financial results are not immune to a sustained economic downturn 
for example  the recent domestic and global economic uncertainty resulted in reduced demand for information technology  including enterprise software and services 
the direction and relative strength of the global economy continues to be uncertain and makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
information technology spending has historically declined as general economic and market conditions worsened 
during challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets  many customers delay or reduce technology purchases 
contract negotiations may become more protracted or difficult if customers institute additional internal approvals for technology purchases or require more negotiation of contract terms and conditions 
such economic conditions could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and reductions in the rate at which our customers renew their maintenance agreements and procure consulting services 

table of contents furthermore  a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions have adversely impacted the financial services industry over the past several years 
if this adverse trend were to continue  it would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and engineering operations 
in order to expand sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional resellers and or increase the productivity of existing resellers 
factors that may affect our operating results include the possibility of a prolonged period of limited economic growth or possible economic decline in and adverse effects of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe  including its expected negative impact on european economic growth versus the rest of the world  disruptions to the credit and financial markets in europe  the us  and elsewhere  contractions or limited growth in corporate spending  adverse economic conditions that may be specific to information technology and the software industry  and risk that the size of the market for our products will not support more sales professionals 
we continue to monitor market conditions and may make adjustments to our business in order to reduce the adverse impact that changes to the economic environment could have on our business 
we expect to continue to explore both organic and strategic growth opportunities 
in particular  we may acquire companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic  operational and financial performance of our business 
business model we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
fiscal year for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded total revenue of million  an increase of over fiscal license revenue was million  an increase of compared to the previous year 
our operating income decreased by or million to million in fiscal due primarily to the expansion of our sales generating headcount 
we produced million of operating cash flows and ended the year with million in cash and short term investments compared with million at december  diluted earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap was in fiscal compared to for fiscal for a decrease of 
during fiscal  we completed our acquisition of quiterian sl  a privately held software company that provides visual data mining  social media analytics and predictive analytics for business and other non technical users 
we acquired of the outstanding shares held by the quiterian shareholders for million in cash 
this purchase price was entirely paid upon closing on october   net of a holdback 
our total headcount at the end of fiscal year was compared to employees at the end of last year 
fiscal year the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions starting in early fiscal year 
table of contents adversely impacted it spending in the financial services industry throughout fiscal year if this trend continues into  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal year  we expect three additional trends to continue that would have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly if at all in the fiscal year  particularly among financial services companies in the united states and western europe 
secondly  corporations are reluctant to buy software from new vendors and we continue to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence  analytics  big data  performance management and customer communications management software purchases among fewer suppliers 
finally  we expect to experience vigorous competition in the bi market 
several of our competitors have released products that are marketed to be directly competitive with our offerings 
as one of the few independent bi and analytics vendors remaining  actuate faces competition from large and well established vendors including microsoft  sap  oracle and ibm  all of which have acquired bi players to add to their technology stacks 
the existence of these competitive products may require additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which could result in extended sales cycles 
for fiscal year  we will continue to pursue our strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth driven by birt and actuateone  related to business intelligence  analytics  big data  performance management and customer communications management markets 
these initiatives are as follows investing in birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in birt 
birt has become widely adopted by developers and continues to drive demand for our birt based commercially available products in the actuateone suite 
the birt project is a core  long term initiative 
selling to it management we are re focusing our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
selling to line of business management we are creating business and performance analytics applications and software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these offerings are in the areas of performance management  business analytics and customer self service and statementing 
we hope these initiatives will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we continue to focus on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
we anticipate a negative impact of the slow recovery in it spending in this sector through however  we believe that once the issues in financial services are resolved  the industry will once again lead in the adoption of bi and information applications both inside and outside the firewall 
building out and delivering on the roadmap of applying birt to additional data sources including hard to reach print stream data by investing in the development of birt based xenos offerings 
building out and delivering on the roadmap of customer communications management capabilities by integrating xenos offerings into the ihub 
building out and delivering on the roadmap of birt analytics capabilities by integrating quiterian offerings into the ihub 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  future expectations  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  restructuring and integration costs  allocation of purchase price of acquisitions  and the impairment of goodwill  have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
actuate generates revenues from the sales of software licenses and related services 
the company receives software license revenues from licensing its products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oems 
the company receives service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that actuate performs for customers 
if the license agreement contains payment terms indicating that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the significant judgments and estimates for revenue recognition typically relate to the timing of an amount recognized for software license fee revenue  including whether collectability is deemed probable  fees are fixed or determinable and whether or not services are essential to the functionality of the software 
changes to these assumptions would generally impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized for software related revenues 
the company establishes vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support using a bell shaped curve approach for certain types of license transactions  and uses a stated maintenance renewal approach for other categories of license transactions 
when applying the bell shaped curve approach the company analyzes all maintenance renewal transactions over the past twelve months for that category of license and plots those data points on a bell shaped curve to ensure that the a high percentage of the data points are within an acceptable margin of the established vsoe rate 
this analysis is performed quarterly 
when applying the stated renewal rate approach  the company ensures that the individual license transaction includes a clear and substantive renewal rate explicitly stated in the documentation for the transaction 
furthermore  the company ensures that it has a practice of consistently renewing those transactions at the contractual rate 
this is done by reviewing maintenance renewals on these contracts and making sure that a very high percentage are renewed at the renewal rates stipulated in the contract 
the application of above vsoe methodologies requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  including vsoe of fair value  for some or all elements 
changes to the elements in our sales arrangements  or our ability to establish vsoe or fair value for those elements may impact the timing of recognizing revenue which may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 

table of contents the company assesses the collectability of fees from end users based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
our standard payment terms are net days  although we do offer payment terms beyond that in some cases 
we periodically provide extended payment terms and we consider any fees due beyond days to not be fixed or determinable 
in such cases  judgment is required in determining the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also cease recognizing future revenues on any outstanding domestic maintenance renewal invoices which are older than days past due 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
accounts are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once collection efforts are unsuccessful 
historically  such losses have been within management s expectations 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the service period for awards that are expected to vest based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchases 
we calculate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the use of a black scholes merton model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected forfeiture rate 
as a result  the future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of the expected term of options granted is derived from historical share option exercise experience 
in the future  we may change our estimate of the expected term  which would impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
income taxes 
we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss carryovers  and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax 
table of contents rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we also apply a two step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before actually preparing and filing the tax returns 
our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 
changes in our business  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  and developments in current and future tax audits  could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carry forwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified 
based on the analysis of positive and negative factors noted above  we have no valuation allowance against us federal deferred tax assets 
in the current year  management determined that it was more likely than not that the company s california research and development r d credits would not be realized based on the size of the r d credit carry forward and the r d credits being generated exceeding the r d credits being utilized 
as such  a full valuation allowance was recorded against the company s deferred tax asset for california r d credit carry forwards 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions with a history of losses and a partial valuation allowance in foreign jurisdictions where operating results beyond a certain time frame are less reliable 
if  in the future  we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
we only recognize an income tax expense or benefit with respect to uncertain tax positions in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
to make this judgment  we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws  regulations and administrative practices 
if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes 
to determine if a tax position is effectively settled  we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed 
we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the months after each fiscal year end 
these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements 
we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or 
table of contents circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
accrual for restructuring charges 
we incurred certain restructuring charges that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred  including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities 
we periodically update the estimates based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
updates to estimates of sublease income were not significant in fiscal years  and acquisitions purchase price allocation 
we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying acquired net tangible and intangible assets  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  and widely accepted valuation techniques 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  subscriptions  support agreements  consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed 
while we use our estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  subsequent adjustments  if any  are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
for additional discussion  see note  acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
valuation of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company begins its impairment test by applying a market approach 
given the company has one reporting unit  this approach involves comparing the market capitalization of the company to its carrying value 
if this market approach derives a fair value that significantly exceeds the carrying value of the company then no further testing is performed 
however  if the market approach indicates the fair value does not significantly exceed the carrying value of the company  we perform a supplemental calculation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach 

table of contents we then consider the results of both the market approach and income approach to determine whether or not it is necessary to move to the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis in order to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
thus far  the market approach has consistently indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was significantly higher than the carrying value 
therefore  we have determined that there has been no impairment and consequently it has not been necessary to perform a supplemental income approach to the valuation

the increase in our total revenues in fiscal was due to increase of or approximately million of license revenues led primarily by an increase in our xenos related product sales as well as continued strength in birt related product sales  and corresponding services 

table of contents the increase in license revenues was partially offset by lower services revenues which decreased or approximately million due mainly to higher decline rates for maintenance renewals  especially on our legacy e 
report designer erd product line 
revenues outside of north america increased by  or approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year this increase was driven by a or million increase in asia  and by or million increase in europe 
the revenue increase in asia was driven by two transactions which resulted in combined license revenues in excess of million 
these international revenues represented of our total revenues in fiscal foreign currency exchange losses negatively impacted our international revenues during fiscal our north america revenues decreased by or approximately million primarily due to lower services revenues  which decreased by or approximately million during the year as we experienced higher decline rates for maintenance renewals especially related to our legacy erd product line

for fiscal year we closed transactions in excess of  and recognized license revenue of million or more on transactions 
for fiscal year we closed transactions in excess of  and recognized license revenue of million or more on transactions 
we do not expect to rely on any one customer for our future business 
the increase in our total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to improving license sales in north america of or million 
this increase was despite the fact that in fiscal we concluded on a large transaction with ibm regarding distributions of actuate software by ibm 
as a result of that transaction  we recorded million of revenue in north america in the third quarter of fiscal of this total  approximately million was apportioned to license and the remaining million to maintenance revenue 
revenues outside of north america increased by  or approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year this increase was driven by a or million increase in asia  offset by or  decrease in europe

our birt based product sales increased by during fiscal as we saw new customer additions  higher transaction count as well as increases in average order sizes 
these positive trends in north america and asia resulted in increased license revenues of  or approximately million and  or approximately  over fiscal  respectively 
these positive trends were offset by weaker european license sales which decreased or approximately million in fiscal compared to for fiscal year  north america accounted for approximately of the total license revenue while the europe and asia pacific regions combined accounted for of the total license revenues

the decrease in services revenue was driven primarily by maintenance renewal declines  adverse currency exchange impacts and fewer compliance transactions during the year 
maintenance renewal revenues decreased by approximately million during fiscal of this decrease  approximately  was attributed to foreign currency exchange losses 
fewer compliance related transactions also attributed to approximately million of the lowered maintenance renewal revenues as these transactions typically include back maintenance 
the compliance group is an internal organization established to monitor and ensure that our customers remain in full compliance with the provisions of their respective licensing agreements with actuate 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in maintenance and support revenues from our xenos division 
it is important to note that we are transitioning from our legacy e 
reports product suite to our new birt based product offering 
as our legacy products age  we have experienced higher than normal decline rates which may continue for the foreseeable future 
in the mean time  birt is expected to become the dominant contributor to license and maintenance revenues 
as this transition progresses  we expect to see our maintenance renewal decline rate improve  eventually resulting in stronger maintenance growth rates in the future 
professional services revenues also decreased during fiscal as we continue to experience an increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers in compared to last year 
these birt based projects do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
most of the decrease in professional services revenue was in north america and asia  while europe accounted for an increase over the prior year 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in xenos related professional services revenues 

table of contents by region  north america accounted for approximately of the total services revenue in fiscal while europe and asia pacific regions accounted for and of the total services revenues  respectively 
most of the million decrease in service revenue in europe was attributed to unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal the  increase in services revenues in asia was primarily due to a large compliance transaction that included back maintenance 
during fiscal  services revenue increased or approximately million driven by improved maintenance renewal rates as well as higher revenues associated with incremental license revenues during fiscal and also  our prior year services revenues were negatively impacted due to the fact that certain revenue could not be recognized due to the impact of purchase accounting on the acquired xenos maintenance contracts 
fiscal service revenues were also positively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations in europe 
by region  north america accounted for approximately of the total services revenue in fiscal while europe and asia pacific regions accounted for and of the total services revenues  respectively 
most of the million increase in service revenue in europe was attributed to favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal the  increase in asia pacific region was due primarily to a large transaction in japan 
costs and expenses cost of license fees year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands percent of license revenue cost of license fees consists primarily of salaries  production costs including printing and packaging  amortization of purchased technologies  third party royalty fees and localization costs 
the increase in cost of license fees in absolute dollars for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period was not significant 
the decrease in cost of license fees in absolute dollars for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period was primarily related to additional production related expenses incurred during fiscal associated with the release of actuateone 
also in december we fully amortized the purchase technologies associated with our january acquisition of performancesoft  which resulted in lower amortization expense in fiscal compared to the corresponding periods last year 
we expect our cost of license fees  as a percentage of revenues from license fees  to increase as a result of our acquisition of quiterian which will result in additional amortization of purchased technology in fiscal cost of services year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands percent of services revenue 
table of contents cost of services consists primarily of personnel and related costs  stock based compensation  facilities costs incurred providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  personnel cost in support of our contract compliance function  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
the decrease in cost of services for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  was due to lower compensation expense which decreased by approximately  primarily related to our compliance and maintenance renewal group 
the compliance group is an internal organization established to monitor and ensure that our customers remain in full compliance with the provisions of their respective licensing agreements with actuate 
third party consulting fees also decreased due to lower professional services revenues 
partially offsetting these decreases was higher depreciation related to our new headquarter facility  which we occupied in the increase in cost of services for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  was due partially to the timing of the acquisition of xenos in february  which resulted in eleven months of xenos expenses in fiscal compared with a full year of expenses in fiscal commission and bonus expense increased by approximately million in fiscal due primarily to higher compliance related bookings 
improved maintenance renewal rates during the year resulted in higher maintenance and support revenues which resulted in additional bonuses to the maintenance group 
in addition  we experienced increased third party consulting fees of approximately  due to a significant customer migration project in the first half of fiscal  which placed a higher demand on our professional services partners as we lacked sufficient internal actuate resources to meet the customer dates 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower salaries and benefits of approximately  due to a continued decrease in our average professional services headcount and lower stock based compensation expenses 
we currently expect cost of services to be in the range of to of total services revenues for fiscal sales and marketing year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands percent of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  stock based compensation  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in employee salaries  sales commissions and related compensation as our average sales and marketing headcount increased by or employees compared to fiscal as we added headcount in an effort to increase sales capacity 
the increase in commissions was the result of improving license sales 
expenses related to our corporate sales kickoff  quota club  and marketing and sales presentations were higher by approximately  compared to fiscal our corporate sales kickoff expense was higher in the current year because we held a large  single event in compared to smaller  regional events in the prior year 
we also experienced increases in marketing related expenses driven mainly by birt road shows and depreciation expense related to our new headquarter facility  which we occupied in the increase in fiscal was due partially to the timing of the acquisition of xenos in february  which resulted in eleven months of xenos expenses in fiscal compared with a full year of expenses in fiscal in addition  salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and employee travel combined to account for approximately  of the increase in fiscal expenses 
the increase in salaries was due to a slight 
table of contents increase in our average year to date sales and marketing headcount as well as annual merit increases

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during fiscal years  and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on the related receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately  in fiscal  million in fiscal and approximately million during fiscal we performed a sensitivity analysis on the net monetary accounts subject to revaluation that are held primarily by our international subsidiaries 
we used the following steps to determine the approximate impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations identified material net monetary assets held in non functional currencies 
these primarily consist of the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  and the us dollar based net assets held by our international subsidiaries 
applied hypothetical changes in exchange rates to these net monetary balances held by each subsidiary as identified above 
the result was a hypothetical revaluation gain or loss in the subsidiary s functional currency 
we then translated the revaluation result as described above to us dollars using the latest quarter average exchange rate 
this resulted in hypothetical revaluation gains or losses before income taxes 
these hypothetical results are summarized in the table below as of december  annual change in currency exchange in thousands interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest primarily in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is limited risk exposure 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we sell primarily to customers in the financial services industry  predominantly in the united states and europe 
accordingly  unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the financial services industry has had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience cyclical fluctuations in profitability  which may affect timing of  or actual purchases of  our products which would have a material adverse effect on the our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there was no customer that accounted for more than of total sales in fiscal 
table of contents we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified by geography 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results of operations 
the company is not currently invested in any derivative securities
