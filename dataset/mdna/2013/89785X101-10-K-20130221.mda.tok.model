our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonality of our customers businesses as well as timing and duration of project work 
demand for our staffing services is higher during the second and third quarters of the year with demand peaking in the third quarter and lower during the first and fourth quarters  in part due to limitations to outside work during the winter months

for fiscal  revenue grew to billion  a increase compared to the prior year 
the strong revenue growth in was primarily driven by strong demand for our services across most major industries and geographies 
we experienced double digit revenue growth in most of the industry groups we serve

table of contents gross profit represents revenues from services less direct costs of services  which consist of payroll  payroll taxes  workers compensation insurance costs  and reimbursable costs 
gross profit as a percent of revenue improved by for fiscal primarily due to increased bill rates which more than offset increases to minimum wages and unemployment taxes in our team continues to leverage our specialized approach in the blue collar market along with disciplined pricing to drive higher gross margin 
we are selective in the customers we serve and diligent in our approach to setting appropriate bill rates 
workers compensation expense was of revenue for fiscal and for fiscal we actively manage the safety of our temporary workers with our risk management programs and work together with our network of service providers to control costs 
we further reduced accidents for fiscal and the associated cost of workers compensation 
for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of revenue was unchanged compared to fiscal due to offsetting factors 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal included the benefit of hire act credits  net of other payroll tax items  of of revenue 
the hire act provided incentives for hiring and retaining workers by exempting the employer share of the social security tax on wages paid to qualified individuals beginning on march  and expired on december  excluding the benefit of these net hire act credits  gross profit as a percent of revenue for compared to has improved by 
the improvement was primarily due to our success with pricing and increased billing rates 
workers compensation expense was of revenue for fiscal and for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were as follows in millions  except percentages selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue sg a as a percentage of revenue remained relatively constant at for as compared to for the prior year 
the increase in sg a spending of million or for fiscal is primarily due to the variable selling and other operating expenses associated with the revenue increase of million or 
excluding revenue from a large customer  revenue increased million or over the prior year 
revenue from this large customer declined approximately million compared to the operations servicing this customer were not reduced as they are located in a national recruiting and service center that is being leveraged to grow other service lines 
we remain focused on leveraging our cost structure which should produce incremental operating margins with additional future revenue 
we have continued to invest in our specialized vertical market sales and service strategy and projects to further improve our efficiency and effectiveness in recruiting and retaining our temporary workers and attracting and retaining our customers 
we completed a major investment in the operating system of our largest brand during we are seeing the benefits of improved operating efficiency 
for fiscal  sg a declined to as a percentage of revenue as compared to for fiscal during we produced strong incremental operating margins as we leveraged our fixed cost structure 
the increase in sg a spending for was primarily due to two factors 
first  we experienced an expected increase in variable expenses to support the increased revenue of million over the prior year 
second  we invested in specialized sales and marketing personnel to sell to and serve our vertical market customer groups 
our vertical market specialists and their programs made significant contributions to our revenue growth 
we also filled open sales and service positions in local markets and made a variety of market adjustment increases to compensation to retain our key performers 
depreciation and amortization and interest depreciation and amortization and interest were as follows in millions  except percentages depreciation and amortization percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization for fiscal increased over the prior year by million primarily from increased capital spending on enterprise technology improvement projects 
these projects are designed to further improve our efficiency and effectiveness in recruiting and retaining our temporary workers and attracting and retaining our customers 
page 
table of contents interest and other income  net depreciation and amortization and interest were as follows in millions  except percentages interest and other income  net percentage of revenue net interest income for remained relatively flat when compared to net interest income for increased over due to increased yields on our restricted cash and investments and the renewal of our revolving credit facility with lower fees and cost to borrow 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was as follows in millions except percentages income tax expense effective income tax rate our effective tax rate on earnings for was compared to for the same period in the increase in the effective income tax rate is due primarily to federal work opportunity tax credits which largely expired at the end of this income tax credit was designed to encourage employers to hire workers from certain targeted groups with higher than average unemployment rates 
the principal difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective income tax rate results from state income taxes  federal tax credits and certain non deductible expenses 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters 
the american taxpayer relief act of the act was signed into law on january  the act retroactively restored the work opportunity tax credit 
because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment  the retroactive effect of the act on the company us federal taxes for  a benefit of approximately million  will be recognized in in addition  we expect the act extension of these provisions through the end of will reduce our estimated annual effective tax rate for compared to results of operations future outlook the following highlights represent our expectations in regard to operating trends for fiscal year these expectations are subject to revision as our business changes with the overall economy our top priority remains to increase revenue and leverage our cost structure which should produce incremental operating margins with additional future revenue 
we will continue to invest in our specialized sales and customer service programs which we believe will enhance our ability to capitalize on further revenue growth and customer retention 
we actively pursue large project opportunities in vertical markets with growth opportunities 
one of our largest successes is in the construction of renewable energy projects 
while our growth rates have diminished due to more challenging prior year comparisons  renewable energy projects remain an attractive opportunity 
effective february   we acquired mdt personnel  the third largest general labor staffing firm in the united states 
mdt supplies blue collar labor to industries similar to those served by trueblue  including construction  event staffing  disaster recovery  hospitality  and manufacturing through its network of branches and customer on site locations in states 
trueblue will expand the size of its general labor business by merging mdt operations with those of the labor ready brand 
selected branches will be consolidated to leverage our cost structure and produce long term incremental operating margins 
the acquisition will enhance trueblue national position as the leading provider of dependable blue collar temporary labor 
the decision to acquire mdt operations reflects our overall optimism about growth in the staffing industry 
we will continue to pursue other opportunities to grow our share of the blue collar market through acquisitions 
as the economy grows  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our market presence 
all of our multi location brands have opportunities to expand through new physical locations or by sharing existing locations 
where possible  we plan to expand the presence of our brands by sharing existing locations to achieve cost synergies 
we plan to build on our success with centralized recruitment and dispatch of our temporary workers to locations without physical branches and expand our geographic reach 
page 
table of contents we have been investing in mobile technology solutions 
we see compelling opportunities to improve the speed in assigning candidates to jobs and increase the productivity of our branch employees resulting in the consolidation of branches and other benefits to our cost structure 
these technologies are currently under development and we expect to deploy them during the middle of we believe this will position us to begin generating efficiencies during the back half of the extent of additional efficiencies will be understood after our deployment and evaluation in services for a large customer project have been declining throughout as the project matures and our customer makes workforce adjustments 
while we expect continued revenue from this customer  our work is project based and the completion of certain projects will continue to impact our revenue trends 
revenue from this customer was approximately million in we expect that to continue to decline in customer demand for blue collar staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and trends towards greater workforce flexibility within the blue collar markets in which we operate 
due to our industry sensitivity to economic factors  the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short term nature of staffing assignments  our visibility for future demand is limited 
as a result  we monitor a number of economic indicators as well as certain trends to estimate future revenue 
future results will be dependent on whether the underlying economic uncertainty continues  trends in customer preference towards a more flexible workforce continue  and our ability to more effectively and efficiently serve customer needs 
based on these anticipated trends  we expect continued uncertainty in the economy and pressure on revenue in however  we are encouraged by an improving construction market and diminishing uncertainty 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  timing of collections  seasonal sales patterns and profit margins 
over the past three fiscal years  net cash provided by operations was approximately million 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities were as follows in millions net income adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash from operating activities depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts stock based compensation deferred income taxes other operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities accounts receivable income taxes accounts payable and other accrued expenses workers compensation claims reserve other assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily due to net income of million 
in  accounts receivable increased by million primarily due to continued revenue growth 
in  accounts receivable increased by million due to revenue growth and a low beginning balance due to significant customer payments received at the end of page 
table of contents the increase in depreciation and amortization during is primarily due to increased capital spending focused on enterprise technology improvement projects 
these projects are designed to further improve our efficiency and effectiveness in recruiting and retaining our temporary workers and attracting and retaining our customers 
generally our workers compensation reserve for estimated claims increases as temporary labor services increase and decreases as temporary labor services decline 
during the current year  our workers compensation reserve increased as we increased the delivery of temporary labor services  partially offset by the timing of claim payments 
income taxes receivable increased in due to over payments of estimated taxes as a result of larger than expected deductions 
cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities were as follows in millions capital expenditures change in restricted cash and cash equivalents purchase of restricted investments maturities of restricted investments other net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures were higher in primarily related to investments made to upgrade our proprietary information systems and invest in enterprise technology improvement projects 
these projects are designed to further improve our efficiency and effectiveness in recruiting  dispatching and retaining our workers as well as leveraging our centralized service delivery and making it easier for the customer to do business 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will be approximately million in restricted cash and investments consist primarily of collateral that has been provided or pledged to insurance carriers and state workers compensation programs 
the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents is primarily a product of purchasing restricted investments  maturities on restricted investments  and payments to workers compensation insurance providers 
when combining this change with purchases of restricted investments net of maturities of restricted investments  restricted cash and investments increased by million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in the collateral requirements by our workers compensation insurance providers related to growth in operations and due the timing of payments to our insurance providers 
in  the changes to restricted cash and investments were primarily due an agreement we entered into with aig  formerly known as chartis  and the bank of new york mellon creating a trust trust which holds the majority of our collateral obligations under existing workers compensation insurance policies previously held directly by aig 
restricted investments increased by million for  primarily due to additional restricted cash and investments required as collateral due to growth 
the change to other includes the purchase of a staffing company and a technology company in page 
table of contents cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities were as follows in millions purchases and retirement of common stock net proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans common stock repurchases for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock payments on debt other net cash used in financing activities under our authorized stock repurchase program  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock during fiscal for a total amount of million including commissions 
we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock during fiscal for a total amount of million including commissions 
future outlook we are in a strong financial position to fund working capital needs for planned growth 
the strength of our current financial position is highlighted as follows we have cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  our borrowing availability under our credit facility is principally based on accounts receivable and the value of our corporate building 
we have million of borrowing available under our credit facility as of december  we believe the credit facility provides adequate borrowing availability 
the majority of our workers compensation payments are made from restricted cash versus cash from operations 
on july   we filed a million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that replaced our previous shelf registration which expired in july the shelf registration allows us to sell various securities in amounts and prices determined at the time of sale 
the filing enables us to access capital efficiently and quickly if needed  however  we have no current plans to make an offering 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months  and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  should economic conditions again deteriorate  our financial results could be adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
these additional sources of financing may not be available  or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
capital resources we have a credit agreement with bank of america  na and wells fargo capital finance  llc for a secured revolving credit facility of up to a maximum of million the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires in september the maximum amount we can borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to certain borrowing limits 
specifically  we are limited to the sum of of our eligible accounts receivable and the liquidation value of our tacoma headquarters office building not to exceed million  which is reduced quarterly by million 
as of december   the tacoma headquarters office building liquidation value totaled million 
this borrowing limit is further reduced by the sum of a reserve in an amount equal to the payroll and payroll taxes for our temporary employees for one payroll cycle and other reserves if deemed applicable 
as of december   the maximum million was available and letters of credit in the amount of million had been issued against the facility  leaving an unused portion of million 
the letters of credit collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation 
the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain liquidity in excess of million or be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio 
liquidity is defined as the amount we are entitled to borrow as advances under the revolving credit facility plus the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts subject to a control agreement benefiting the lenders 
the amount we were entitled to borrow at december  was million and the amount of cash and cash equivalents under control agreements was page 
table of contents million for a total of million of liquidity  which is well in excess of the minimum liquidity requirement 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we pay a variable rate of interest on funds borrowed that is based on libor or the prime rate  at our option  plus an applicable spread based on excess liquidity as set forth below excess liquidity prime rate loans libor rate loans greater than million between million and million less than million a fee on borrowing availability of is also applied against the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
letters of credit are priced at the margin in effect for libor loans  plus a fronting fee of obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property and our headquarters located in tacoma  washington 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions that allow us to restrict cash and cash equivalents and investments for the purpose of providing collateral instruments to our insurance carriers to satisfy workers compensation claims 
at december   we had restricted cash and investments totaling approximately million 
in  we entered into an agreement with aig  formerly known as chartis  and the bank of new york mellon creating a trust trust which holds the majority of our collateral obligations under existing workers compensation insurance policies previously held directly by aig 
we established investment policy directives for the trust  with the first priority to be preservation of capital  second to maintain and ensure a high degree of liquidity  and third to maximize after tax returns 
trust investments must meet minimum acceptable quality standards 
the primary investments include us treasury securities  us agency debentures  us agency mortgages  corporate securities  and municipal securities

for policy years beginning in july and thereafter  aig  formerly known as chartis  has been our workers compensation carrier 
the policy year is effective july to june and is subject to annual renewal 
we completed our renewal with aig for the policy year in june 
for certain states we pay workers compensation insurance premiums and obtain full coverage under government administered programs 
the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for an event above a million deductible limit  on a per occurrence basis 
this results in our being substantially self insured 
while we have primary responsibility for all claims  our insurance coverage provides reimbursement for certain losses and expenses beyond our deductible limits excess claims 
we have full liability for all remaining payments on claims that originated between january and june  without recourse to any third party insurer as the result of a novation agreement we entered into with kemper insurance company in december prior to  we were insured by various carriers who are now insolvent and as a result we are substantially reserved for any claims above the self insurance limit 
workers compensation collateral our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs require us to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation  for which they become responsible should we become insolvent 
the collateral typically takes the form of cash and cash backed instruments  highly rated investment grade securities  letters of credit  and or surety bonds 
on a regular basis  these entities assess the amount of collateral they will require from us relative to our workers compensation obligation 
such amounts can increase or decrease independent of our assessments and reserves 
we generally anticipate that our collateral page 
table of contents commitments will continue to grow as we grow our business 
we pay our premiums and deposit our collateral in installments 
aig is the beneficiary of the trust held at bank of new york mellon  which holds the majority of the restricted cash and investments collateralizing our self insured workers compensation policies 
our total collateral commitments were made up of the following components in millions cash collateral held by insurance carriers cash and cash equivalents held in trust investments held in trust letters of credit surety bonds total collateral commitments included in this amount is million and million of accrued interest at december  and december   respectively 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions to issue letters of credit as collateral 
we had million and million of restricted cash collateralizing our letters of credit at december  and december   respectively 
our surety bonds are issued by independent insurance companies on our behalf and bear annual fees based on a percentage of the bond  which is determined by each independent surety carrier  but do not exceed of the bond amount  subject to a minimum charge 
the terms of these bonds are subject to review and renewal every one to four years and most bonds can be canceled by the sureties with as little as days notice

summary of critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation reserves we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
these estimates include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves  which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns  are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns on risk free us treasury instruments  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly 
if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceed the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
changes in reserve estimates are reflected in the statement of operations in the period when the changes in estimates are made 
our workers compensation reserves include estimated expenses related to claims above our self insured limits excess claims and a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies 
we discount the reserve and its corresponding receivable to its respective estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the actuarially determined weighted average lives of our excess claims 
when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized 
there are two main factors that impact workers compensation expense the number of claims and the cost per claim 
the number of claims is driven by the volume of hours worked  the business mix which reflects the type of work performed  and the safety of the environment where the work is performed 
the cost per claim is driven primarily by the severity of the injury  the state in which the injury occurs  related medical costs  and lost time wage costs 
a increase in the cost of claims incurred would result in an increase to workers compensation expense of million 
we have not had significant changes in the assumptions used in calculating our reserve balance 
however  our reserve balances have been positively impacted primarily by the success of our page 
table of contents accident prevention programs 
in the event that we are not able to further reduce our accident rates  the positive impacts to our reserve balance will diminish 
stock based compensation under various plans  officers  employees and non employee directors have received or may receive grants of stock  restricted stock awards  performance share units or options to purchase common stock 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan espp 
compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  based on the stock s fair market value on the grant date 
for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions  compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche 
we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest  rather than record forfeitures when they occur 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in the future periods 
we determine the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
we recognize expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and record adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates 
based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term  management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal would not have been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience  expectations of future write offs and current economic data and represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and past due balances are written off when it is probable the receivable will not be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
we allocated goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business combination 
we do not amortize goodwill but test it for impairment annually as of the last day of our fiscal third quarter  or when indications of potential impairment exist 
we monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
we consider our brands labor ready  spartan staffing  clp resources  planetechs and centerline to be reporting units for goodwill impairment testing 
in fiscal  and  there were no changes to our reporting units 
the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 
the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
then  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess  not to exceed the carrying value 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using a discounted cash flow model 
based on our test  the fair market value of our reporting units was substantially greater than net carrying value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit 
critical assumptions include projected revenue growth  gross profit rates  selling  general and administrative expense rates  working capital fluctuations  capital expenditures and terminal growth rates  as well as an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
discount rates are determined using the capital asset pricing model 
the blue collar staffing market is subject to volatility based on overall economic conditions 
as a consequence  our revenues tend to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow  as occurred during conversely  our revenues also decrease quickly when the economy begins to weaken  as occurred during the most recent recession 
if actual results were to significantly deviate from management estimates and assumptions of future performance  we could experience a material impairment to our goodwill 
we also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our company s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations 
we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
page 
table of contents we have indefinite lived intangible assets related to our clp resources and spartan staffing trade names 
we test our trade names annually for impairment  or when indications of potential impairment exist 
we utilize the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of each of our trade names 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess 
considerable management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions  including projected revenue  royalty rates and appropriate discount rates 
an impairment assessment of physical assets is necessary whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in such cases  the asset must be written down to the greater of the net realizable value or fair market value 
reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities from time to time we are subject to compliance audits by federal  state  and local authorities relating to a variety of regulations including wage and hour laws  taxes  workers compensation  immigration  and safety 
from time to time we are also subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations 
we have established reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities 
we record a liability when our management judges that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent that an insurance company is contractually obligated to reimburse us for a liability  we record a receivable for the amount of the probable reimbursement 
we evaluate our reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
income taxes and related valuation allowances we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon the provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as changes to federal and state corporate tax rates and the mix of states and their taxable income  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
in  we entered into an agreement with aig  formerly known as chartis  and the bank of new york mellon creating a trust which holds the majority of our collateral obligations under existing workers compensation insurance policies previously held by aig 
the trust now holds a significant portion of our total restricted cash and investments  much of which is invested in high quality debt instruments 
as a result of the shift in our restricted cash and investments portfolio  we are exposed to risk from interest rates and credit exposure 
we mitigate these risks through investment policy directives for the trust  with the first priority to be the preservation of capital  and second to maintain and ensure a high degree of liquidity 
the investments are broadly diversified among high quality investments in us treasury securities  us agency debentures  us agency mortgages  corporate securities  and municipal securities 
the individual investments within the trust are subject to credit risk due to possible rating changes  default or impairment 
we monitor the portfolio to ensure this risk does not exceed prudent levels 
we consistently apply and adhere to our investment policy of holding high quality  diversified securities 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold all investments until maturity and accordingly all our investments are classified as held to maturity 
any fluctuation or change in interest rates would not impact our net income 
furthermore  an increase or decrease in interest rates immediately and uniformly by would not have a material effect on our restricted cash and investments or cash and cash equivalents balances 
we have a certain amount of assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to our international operations 
we have not hedged our foreign currency translation risk and we have the ability to hold our foreign currency page
