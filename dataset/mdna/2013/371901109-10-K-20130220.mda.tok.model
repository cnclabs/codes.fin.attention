as a result of the fast ramp up in global automotive light vehicle production in the second half of and the continuation through calendar year  the company experienced increased costs associated with supply chain constraints on certain automotive grade electronic components 
although availability of certain automotive grade components remained tight throughout this period  the company did experience continued sequential improvement in this area through however  the march   earthquake and tsunami in japan added significant stresses on the supply chain  as many electronic components are supplied by japanese manufacturers who were impacted by the natural disaster 
the company was successful in securing additional quantities of constrained parts to meet anticipated customer demand 
in addition  the company did experience sequential reductions in supply chain related costs through the balance of calendar year  as supply chain constraints disruptions were resolved 
flooding in thailand as a result of heavy rain and monsoons since late july resulted in additional supply chain disruptions as production at certain component supplier plants was moved to their plants in other countries  putting certain suppliers outside of thailand in over capacity situations 
gaining access to those components and ensuring adequate supply resulted in additional costs to the company during the fourth quarter of the company did experience sequential improvement in this area during the first and second quarters of the costs associated with these particular supply chain constraints disruptions have  it appears  been resolved  barring another natural disaster impacting the supply chain 
to date  the supply chain related issues the company has experienced have not disrupted deliveries to customers  but the company continues to apply measures to ensure adequate supply of certain automotive grade components 
as periodically disclosed  the company believes that its patents and trade secrets provide it with a competitive advantage

to that end  and as previously disclosed  during the third quarter of the company has been able to  in the ordinary course of business  obtain certain intellectual property rights related to certain existing and potential future automotive mirror features and products that will decrease potential risks of infringement 
these rights are included on the balance sheet under the category patents and other assets net 
as part of obtaining the above referenced intellectual property rights  the company has also agreed to royalty payments based on shipments of automotive mirror products incorporating certain mirror features 
amortization expense associated with these rights and the royalty payments are currently expected to negatively impacts the gross profit margin by approximately basis points on an annualized basis going forward at least in the near term though the impact over a ten year period is not certain 
the company business is not substantially and materially dependent upon the obtained intellectual property rights 
as previously disclosed  on june   american vehicular sciences llc avs filed four patent infringement complaints in the united states district court in the eastern district of texas  which named the company and one of two of its customers as co defendants

current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea 
the company currently estimates that top line revenue will decrease approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in based on the current ihs worldwide forecast for current light vehicle production levels  our anticipated product mix  as well as our week customer release schedule 
these estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the regions to which the company ships product  as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix 
continuing uncertainties  including light vehicle production levels  supplier part shortages  automotive plant shutdowns  sales rates in europe  asia and north america  deteriorating macroeconomic environment especially in europe  customer inventory management and the impact of potential automotive customer including their tier suppliers and supplier bankruptcies  work stoppages  strikes  etc  which could disrupt shipments to these customers  make forecasting difficult 
the company also continues to experience increasing volatility with customer orders within its twelve week customer release window with some customers including tier mirror suppliers revising orders at the last minute 
due to significant uncertainties with global vehicle production volumes  it is an extremely difficult environment to forecast  and as a result  the company is not providing revenue estimates beyond the first quarter of at this time 
the company also estimates that engineering  research and development expenses are currently expected to decrease approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in  primarily due to reduced costs related to outside contract engineering development services 
in addition  the company estimates that selling  general and administrative expenses are currently expected to be approximately flat in the first quarter of compared with the same period in this estimate is based on stable foreign exchange rates

based on the current ihs forecast for light vehicle production levels for the entire year  the company currently estimates that rcd mirror unit shipments will decrease approximately in calendar year compared with calendar year  based on anticipated current product mix and estimated take rates 
this guidance incorporates estimated reduced shipments to four automotive customers that have previously notified the company of their plans to have the primary display for rear camera video in a radio display in the vehicle center console instead of the interior rearview mirror as previously disclosed 
the company rcd mirror unit shipments are expected to be impacted by these changes initially with two customers in calendar year and with two additional customers beginning in calendar year  with the transitions occurring over multiple years

the company has some assets  liabilities and operations outside the united states  including a euro denominated account  which currently are not significant overall to the company as a whole 
because the company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products

critical accounting policies 
the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates  assumptions and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions 
management also continually reviews its accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized based on the terms of the customer purchase order that indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment 
sales are shown net of returns  which have not historically been significant 
the company does not generate sales from sale arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accounts receivable 
the company reviews a monthly aging report of all accounts receivable balances starting with invoices outstanding over sixty days 
in addition  the company monitors information about its customers through a variety of sources including the media  and information obtained through on going interaction between company personnel and the customer 
based on the evaluation of the above information  the company estimates its allowances related to customer receivables on historical credit and collections experience  customers current financial condition and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
actual collections can differ  requiring adjustments to the allowances  but such adjustments have not  historically  been material 
inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions  evaluation of longer lead times for certain electronic components and related management initiatives 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
investments 
the company s internal investment committee regularly reviews its fixed income and equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other than temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in income 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  the company evaluates  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment 
management also considers the type of security  related industry  sector performance  as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports to evaluate its portfolio 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions continue to deteriorate  the company may incur future impairments 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes 
the company applies the provisions of asc as it relates to uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements 
a threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination is applied to uncertain tax positions 
the company deems the estimates related to this provision to be reasonable  however  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not vary from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc the company utilizes the black scholes model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating a the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  b the volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  c the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures and d expected dividends 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized on the consolidated condensed statements of operations
