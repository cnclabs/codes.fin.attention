item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts in tables are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
overview our company we operate two of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental industry  avis and budget 
we are a leading vehicle rental operator in north america  europe  australia  new zealand and certain other regions we serve  with a fleet of approximately  vehicles 
we also license the use of the avis and budget trademarks to licensees in the areas in which we do not operate directly 
we and our licensees operate the avis and budget brands in approximately countries throughout the world 
our segments we categorize our operations into three reportable business segments north america  consisting of our avis and budget car rental operations in the united states and our avis and budget vehicle rental operations in canada  international  consisting of our avis and budget vehicle operations in europe  the middle east  asia  africa  south america  central america  the caribbean  australia and new zealand  and truck rental  consisting of our budget truck rental operations in the united states 
our international segment includes the operational and financial results of avis europe plc avis europe and apex car rentals apex since our acquisitions of such businesses in october and october  respectively 
business and trends our revenues are derived principally from car and truck rentals in our company owned operations and include i time and mileage t m fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals  ii reimbursement from our customers for certain operating expenses we incur  including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees  as well as airport concession fees  which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations  iii sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals and iv royalty revenue from our licensees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions 
our operating results are subject to variability due to seasonality  macroeconomic conditions and other factors 
car rental volumes tend to be associated with the travel industry  particularly airline passenger volumes  or enplanements  which in turn tend to reflect general economic conditions 
our vehicle rental operations are also seasonal  with the third quarter of the year historically having been our strongest due to the increased level of leisure travel during such quarter 
we have a partially variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size  and therefore the cost  of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand 

table of contents we believe that the following factors  among others  may affect and or impact our financial condition and results of operations worldwide enplanements  fleet  pricing  marketing and strategic decisions made by us and by our competitors  changes in per unit car fleet costs and in conditions in the used vehicle marketplace  changes in borrowing costs and in market willingness to purchase corporate and vehicle related debt  our acquisitions and our integration of their operations and realization of synergies  particularly the integration of avis europe  changes in the price of unleaded gasoline  changes in currency exchange rates  and demand for truck rentals 
in  we faced an uneven macroeconomic environment 
our rental volumes in north america increased amid a modest economic recovery  while rental demand in europe was constrained by an economic recession and socio political issues there 
as discussed further below  vehicle depreciation costs in and declined significantly compared to amid a particularly strong used car market in the united states in and the first half of in total  we achieved significant growth  record revenues and record earnings in net revenues were billion  compared with billion in  representing a increase 
net income was million in  compared with a net loss of million in adjusted ebitda totaled million  compared with million in  representing a increase 
diluted earnings per share were  compared with a loss per share of in we decreased our outstanding corporate debt by million 
our share price increased  to 
as part of our strategic initiatives and restructuring activities  we are driving process improvements to reduce costs  enhance service to our customers and improve our operations 
we have also elected to incur certain restructuring and other expenses as we work to integrate the operations of avis europe and to gain operational efficiencies 
outlook we continue to operate in an uncertain economic environment  which impacted our business in and will continue to do so in the worldwide economy  and europe in particular  continues to struggle with modest  if any  economic growth 
we expect that weak economic conditions and historically high unemployment rates in europe could impact rental demand  fleet costs and capital markets there 
we continue to believe that our budget 
table of contents brand is poised to strengthen its market position in this environment and to experience significant growth from eventual economic improvement in europe 
we believe economic and political issues in the united states  particularly regarding government spending and deficits  may create volatility in in the equity and debt markets in which our securities trade 
in north america  we expect used car residual values to remain strong  on average  relative to longer term historical norms  but that our fleet costs will increase compared to the levels we experienced in and we also expect moderate economic growth in north america  most likely leading to growth in our rental volumes there 
we have experienced declines in realized pricing over the last several years as fleet costs have decreased  and we will look to pursue opportunities for pricing increases in in order to maintain our returns on invested capital and to enhance our profitability 
in january  we announced that we have agreed to acquire zipcar  inc zipcar  the world s leading car sharing network  for approximately million 
the transaction is subject to approval by zipcar shareholders and other customary closing conditions 
we expect that this acquisition  if completed  will position the company to better serve a greater variety of consumer and commercial transportation needs  and will produce significant operating synergies between the two companies operations 
results of operations discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
we measure performance using the following key operating statistics i rental days  which represents the total number of days or portion thereof a vehicle was rented  and ii t m revenue per rental day  which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers 
our car rental operating statistics rental days and t m revenue per rental day are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a hour period 
we believe that this methodology  while conservative  provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business 
our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly titled statistics 
our chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources based upon the separate financial information from the company s operating segments see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and adjusted ebitda  which we define as income from continuing operations before non vehicle related depreciation and amortization  any impairment charge  transaction related costs  non vehicle related interest and income taxes 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs 
these programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs 
we believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because  ultimately  the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets 
financial condition as of december  change total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs assets under vehicle programs liabilities under vehicle programs stockholders equity total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs at december  increased approximately billion from december   primarily due to a billion increase in deferred income taxes related to the generation of net operating losses as a result of accelerated tax depreciation on vehicles  and a million increase in cash and cash equivalents see liquidity and capital resources cash flows

assets under vehicle programs increased approximately billion  primarily due to an increase in the size of our vehicle rental fleet to accommodate increased rental demand and inflationary increases in the average book value of our rental cars 
liabilities under vehicle programs increased approximately billion  reflecting the impact of additional borrowings to support the increase in our vehicle rental fleet and an approximately billion increase in deferred income taxes primarily related to accelerated tax depreciation on vehicles

we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when determining fair value  we utilize various consistent assumptions  including the fair market trading price of our common stock and management s projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among our reporting units 
during  and  there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in the future  failure to achieve our business plans  a significant deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions of the countries in which we operate  or significant changes in the assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets such as the discount rate could result in significantly different estimates of fair value that could trigger an impairment of the goodwill or intangible assets of our reporting units 
business combinations 
the company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations  which requires that the purchase price of acquired companies be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  as applicable  at their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
our assessment of the purchase price allocation and the related fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets 
examples of critical valuation assumptions used by management include projected future cash flows  the estimated weighted average cost of capital and market royalty rates 
we believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and  in part  on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ from those assumptions 
vehicles 
we present vehicles at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record the initial cost of the vehicle  net of incentives and allowances from manufactures 
we acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs 
for rental vehicles purchased under such programs  we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values 
for vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  we depreciate based on the vehicles estimated residual market values and their expected dates of disposition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
currently we do not record valuation allowances on the majority of our tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
public liability  property damage and other insurance liabilities 
insurance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include supplemental liability insurance  personal effects protection insurance  public liability  property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self insured 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents and changes in the ultimate cost per incident

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and gasoline prices 
the acquisition of avis europe in increased our currency exchange risks 
we manage our exposure to market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt  currency forwards to manage and reduce currency exchange rate risk  and derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded gasoline prices 

table of contents we are exclusively an end user of these instruments 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk related to our use of derivatives through specific minimum credit standards  diversification of counterparties  and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience providing such derivative instruments 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses discussed below 
these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
for additional information regarding our borrowings and financial instruments  see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
currency risk management we have currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  euro and new zealand dollar 
we use currency forward contracts and currency swaps to manage currency exchange risk that arises from certain intercompany transactions and from non functional currency denominated assets and liabilities and earnings denominated in non us dollar currencies 
our currency forward contracts are often not designated as hedges and therefore changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as they occur 
we anticipate that such currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on earnings  cash flows and fair values based on a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation in the value of the underlying currencies being hedged  against the us dollar at december  with all other variables held constant  a hypothetical change increase or decrease in currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our earnings at december  because unrealized gains or losses related to foreign currency forward and swap contracts are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged  when combined  these foreign currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk management our primary interest rate exposure at december  was interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
based on our interest rate derivatives as of december   we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings 
because gains or losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged  when combined  these interest rate contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
commodity risk management we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline 
we anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we determined that a hypothetical change in the price of unleaded gasoline would not have a material impact on our earnings at december
