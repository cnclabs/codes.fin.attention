lamar advertising company the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
overview the company s net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the company 
the company relies on sales of advertising space for its revenues 
revenue growth is based on many factors that include the company s ability to increase occupancy of its existing advertising displays  raise advertising rates  and acquire new advertising displays and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions  as well as trends in the advertising industry 
advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions  which affect the rates that the company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays 
historically  the company made strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets to increase the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates in existing and new markets 
while the company has significantly reduced its acquisition activity over the last three years  it will continue to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise 
the company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any future acquisition activity from available cash  borrowings under its senior credit facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
during the year ended december   the company completed acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately million  which included the purchase of nextmedia outdoor  inc that closed october  the company s business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays  the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts  and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment

table of contents the increase in operating income and decrease in interest expense offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt discussed above resulted in a million increase in net income before income taxes 
the company recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  which is higher than the statutory rate due to permanent differences resulting from non deductible expenses and amortization  primarily non deductible compensation expense related to stock based compensation calculated in accordance with asc as a result of the above factors  the company recognized net income for the year ended december  of million  as compared to net income of million for the same period in reconciliations because acquisitions occurring after december  the acquired assets have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented  we provide acquisition adjusted net revenue  which adjusts our net revenue for the year ended december  by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets prior to our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended december  we provide this information as a supplement to net revenues to enable investors to compare periods in and on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions 
management uses this comparison to assess how well we are performing within our existing assets 
acquisition adjusted net revenue is not determined in accordance with gaap 
for this adjustment  we measure the amount of pre acquisition revenue generated by the assets during the period in that corresponds with the actual period we have owned the assets in to the extent within the period to which this report relates 
we refer to this adjustment as acquisition net revenue

of the million increase in billboard net revenue million was generated by adding approximately new digital display panels and approximately million was a result of increased rate and occupancy  over the comparable period in the million increase in logo revenue consists of a million increase due to changes in logo contracts and an increase in internal growth of million 
net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to acquisition adjusted net revenue for the year ended december   increased million or primarily as a result of increased rate and occupancy  as compared to the same period in see reconciliations below 
operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in there was a million decrease in non cash compensation expense related to equity based compensation  offset by a million increase in operating expenses related to the cost of operating the company s core assets and a million increase in corporate expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily a result of the reduction in the number of non performing structures dismantled during as compared to the same period in 
table of contents due to the above factors  operating income increased million to million for year ended december  compared to million for the same period in interest expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily resulting from the reduction in total debt outstanding as well as a decrease in interest rates resulting from the refinancing of the company s senior credit facility during during the period ended december   the company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of  of its outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the company repurchased the senior subordinated notes at an average price of of the original amount of the notes through open market transactions 
as a result of the repurchases  the company recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  of which approximately million was a non cash expense related to the previously capitalized unamortized debt issuance fees and discounts 
during the comparable period in  the company recognized a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt resulting from its refinancing transactions 
approximately million of the loss is a non cash expense attributable to the write off of unamortized debt issuance fees related to the tender offer to repurchase lamar media s senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes and refinancing of its senior credit facility 
the remaining million represented the net cash loss related to the tender offer and extinguishment of the senior subordinated notes 
the increase in operating income and decrease in interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt resulted in a million increase in net income before income taxes 
the increase in net income for the period resulted in an increase in income tax expense as compared to the same period during the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  which is higher than the statutory rate due to permanent differences resulting from non deductible compensation expense related to stock options in accordance with asc and other non deductible expenses and amortization 
as a result of the above factors  the company recognized net income for the year ended december  of million  as compared to a net loss of million for the same period in reconciliations because acquisitions occurring after december  the acquired assets have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented  we provide acquisition adjusted net revenue  which adjusts our net revenue by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets prior to our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in we provide this information as a supplement to net revenues to enable investors to compare periods in and on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions

lamar media may be required to make certain mandatory prepayments on loans outstanding under the senior credit facility that would be applied first to any outstanding term loans  commencing with the year ended december  these payments  if any  are determined annually and are calculated based on a percentage of consolidated excess cash flow as defined in the senior credit facility at the end of each fiscal year 
the percentage of consolidated excess cash flow that must be applied to repay outstanding loans was set at for the fiscal year ended december  for fiscal years ending after december   this percentage is subject to a reduction to if the total holdings debt ratio  as described above  is less than or equal to to as of the last day of such fiscal year 
the company will not be required to make a mandatory prepayment in respect of consolidated excess cash flow for the fiscal year ended december  since there was a consolidated cash flow deficit  in accordance with the calculation as defined in the senior credit facility and the total holdings debt ratio was less than to the company believes that its current level of cash on hand  availability under the senior credit facility and future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet its operating needs through fiscal all debt obligations are reflected on the company s balance sheet

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to long lived asset recovery  intangible assets  goodwill impairment  deferred taxes  asset retirement obligations  stock based compensation and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events and  where applicable  established valuation techniques 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
long lived asset recovery 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangibles comprise a significant portion of the company s total assets 
purchases of property  plant and equipment are recorded at purchase cost  while acquired property  plant and equipment is recorded at fair value determined primarily through estimates of replacement costs 
property  plant and equipment of billion and intangible assets of million are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset before interest expense 
these undiscounted cash flow projections are based on management s assumptions surrounding future operating results and the anticipated future economic environment 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  an impairment of these intangible assets may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined 
during the year ended december   there were no indications that an impairment test was necessary 
intangible assets 
the company has significant intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet 
intangible assets primarily represent site locations of million and customer relationships of million associated with the company s acquisitions 
the fair values of intangible assets recorded are determined using discounted cash flow models that require management to make assumptions related to future operating results  including projecting net revenue growth discounted using current cost of capital rates  of each acquisition and the anticipated future economic environment 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  an impairment of these intangibles may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined 
historically no impairment charge has been required with respect to the company s intangible assets 
goodwill impairment 
the company has a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet and must perform an impairment test of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test requires management to determine the implied fair value of its reporting units and compare it to its book value including goodwill 
to the extent the book value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the company would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indicator that the reporting unit may be impaired 
impairment testing involves various estimates and assumptions  which could vary  and an analysis of relevant market data and market capitalization 

table of contents we have identified two reporting units logo operations and billboard operations in accordance with asc no changes have been made to our reporting units from the prior period 
the reporting units and their carrying amounts of goodwill as of december  and are as follows carrying value of goodwill in thousands december  december  billboard operations logo operations we believe there are numerous facts and circumstances that need to be considered when estimating the reasonableness of the reporting unit s estimated fair value 
in conducting our impairment test  we assessed the reasonableness of the reporting unit s estimated fair value based on both market capitalization and discounted future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow analysis incorporated various growth rate assumptions and discounting based on a present value factor 
consideration of market capitalization the company first considered its market capitalization as of its annual impairment testing date of december the market capitalization of its class a common stock as of december  was billion compared to stockholders equity of million as of that date  resulting in an excess of approximately billion  which is substantially in excess of our book value 
the company considers market capitalization over book value a strong indicator that no impairment of goodwill exists as of the measurement date of december  the following table presents the market capitalization and aggregate book value of the reporting units as of december  equity book value market capitalization in thousands aggregate values as of december  market capitalization was calculated using a day average of the closing prices of the class a common stock beginning trading days prior to the measurement date 
calculations of fair value using discounted cash flow analysis we also estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis that compares the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit to the book value of the reporting unit 
the discount rate and projected revenue and ebitda earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization growth rates are significant assumptions utilized in our calculation of the present value of cash flows used to estimate fair value of the reporting units 
these assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain risks including deterioration in industry and economic conditions 
see discussion in risk factors in item a of this annual report 
for additional information about goodwill  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our discount rate assumption is based on our cost of capital  which we determine annually based on our estimated costs of debt and equity relative to our capital structure 
as of december  our weighted average cost of capital wacc was approximately 
in developing our revenue and ebitda growth rates  we consider our historical performance and current market trends in the markets in which we operate 
the five year projected compound annual growth rate cagr used in our discounted cash flow analysis for billboard revenue and billboard ebitda was and  respectively  and our logo operations revenue and ebitda cagr was and  respectively 
the projected cagr for revenue and ebitda discussed above would have to deteriorate significantly  among other factors  before further testing of goodwill impairment would be necessary for our reporting units 
the fair values calculated as of december   using the discounted cash flow analysis described above for both reporting units were substantially in excess of their book values 
assumptions used in our impairment test  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecast and operating plans 
the following table presents the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and aggregate book value of the reporting units as of december  equity book value fair value in thousands aggregate values as of december  fair value is calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis described above 

table of contents based upon the company s annual review as of december   using both the market capitalization approach and discounted cash flow analysis  there was no indication of a potential impairment and  therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not required and no impairment charge was necessary 
deferred taxes 
as of december   the company had deferred tax assets of million  a component of which is the company s operating loss carry forward  net of existing valuation allowances 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax assets  the company will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the carry forwards governed by the tax code 
based on the current level of pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes and projected decreases in future depreciation and amortization  we will generate the minimum amount of future taxable income to support the realization of the deferred tax assets 
additionally  the company has a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities that will reverse during the same period and jurisdiction and is of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
as a result  management believes that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
for a more detailed description  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations 
the company had an asset retirement obligation of million as of december  this liability relates to the company s obligation upon the termination or non renewal of a lease to dismantle and remove its billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition 
the company records the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which they are incurred 
the liability is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset s carrying amount 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset 
in calculating the liability  the company calculates the present value of the estimated cost to dismantle using an average cost to dismantle  adjusted for inflation and market risk 
this calculation includes of the company s billboard structures on leased land which currently consist of approximately  structures 
the company uses a year retirement period based on historical operating experience in its core markets  including the actual time that billboard structures have been located on leased land in such markets and the actual length of the leases in the core markets  which includes the initial term of the lease  plus consideration of any renewal period 
historical third party cost information is used to estimate the cost of dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on the company s historical credit adjusted risk free rate 
stock based compensation 
share based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
share based payment accounting requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the company has elected to use the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions  including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected life is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and forfeitures of stock options by our employees 
upon the adoption of share based payment accounting  we used a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption as allowed under share based payment accounting 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
share based payment accounting requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of share based payment accounting in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under share based payment accounting may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
during  we recorded million as compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases 
we evaluate and adjust our assumptions on an annual basis 
see note stock compensation plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts based on the payment patterns of its customers 
management analyzes historical results  the economic environment  changes in the credit worthiness of its customers  and other relevant factors in determining the adequacy of the company s allowance 
bad debt expense was million  million and million or approximately  and of net revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
if the future economic environment declines  the inability of customers to pay may occur and the allowance for doubtful accounts may need to be increased  which will result in additional bad debt expense in future years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lamar advertising company and lamar media corp 
lamar advertising company is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with variable rate debt instruments issued by its wholly owned subsidiary lamar media corp 
the information below summarizes the company s interest rate risk associated with its principal variable rate debt instruments outstanding at december   and should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
loans under lamar media corp 
s senior credit facility bear interest at variable rates equal to the jpmorgan chase prime rate or libor plus the applicable margin 
because the jpmorgan chase prime rate or libor may increase or decrease at any time  the company is exposed to market risk as a result of the impact that changes in these base rates may have on the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the senior credit facility 
increases in the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the senior credit facility would result in increased interest expense and a reduction in the company s net income 
at december  there was approximately million of aggregate indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility  or approximately of the company s outstanding long term debt on that date  bearing interest at variable rates 
the aggregate interest expense for with respect to borrowings under the senior credit facility was million  and the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under this credit facility during was 
assuming that the weighted average interest rate was basis points higher that is rather than  then the company s interest expense would have been approximately million higher resulting in an million decrease in the company s net income 
the company attempted to mitigate the interest rate risk resulting from its variable interest rate long term debt instruments by issuing fixed rate long term debt instruments and maintaining a balance over time between the amount of the company s variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness 
in addition  the company has the capability under the senior credit facility to fix the interest rates applicable to its borrowings at an amount equal to libor plus the applicable margin for periods of up to twelve months in certain cases with the consent of the lenders  which would allow the company to mitigate the impact of short term fluctuations in market interest rates 
in the event of an increase in interest rates  the company may take further actions to mitigate its exposure 
the company cannot guarantee  however  that the actions that it may take to mitigate this risk will be feasible or that  if these actions are taken  that they will be effective
