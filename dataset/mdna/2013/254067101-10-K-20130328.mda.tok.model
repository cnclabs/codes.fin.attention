table of contents key performance indicators we use a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating performance to evaluate the performance of our business  including the following fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales in millions gross profit in millions gross profit as a percentage of net sales retail gross profit as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales cash flow from operations in millions total retail store count at end of period retail sales per square foot retail stores sales trend comparable retail store sales trend comparable retail store inventory trend retail merchandise inventory turnover based upon the weeks ended february  and weeks ended february  trends and uncertainties fluctuations in the following key trends and uncertainties may have a material effect on our operating results 
cash flow cash from operating activities is a primary source of liquidity that is adversely affected when the industry faces economic challenges 
furthermore  operating cash flow can be negatively affected when new and existing competitors seek areas of growth to expand their businesses 
pricing if our customers do not purchase our merchandise offerings in sufficient quantities  we respond by taking markdowns 
if we have to reduce our retail selling prices  the cost of sales on our consolidated statement of income will correspondingly rise  thus reducing our income and cash flow 
success of brand the success of our exclusive brand merchandise as well as merchandise we source from national vendors is dependent upon customer fashion preferences and how well we can predict and anticipate trends 
sourcing our store merchandise selection is dependent upon our ability to acquire appealing products from a number of sources 
our ability to attract and retain compelling vendors as well as in house design talent  the adequacy and stable availability of materials and production facilities from which we source our merchandise and the speed at which we can respond to customer trends and preferences all have a significant impact on our merchandise mix and  thus  our ability to sell merchandise at profitable prices 
store growth our ability to open new stores is dependent upon a number of factors  such as the identification of suitable markets and locations and the availability of shopping developments  especially in a weak economic environment 
store growth can be further hindered by mall attrition and subsequent closure of underperforming properties 

table of contents seasonality and inflation our business  like many other retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season 
because of the seasonality of our business  results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results during the periods presented  however  our business could be affected by such in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates the company significant accounting policies are also described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in that note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory 
approximately of the company inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out retail inventory method lifo rim 
under lifo rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
lifo rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the lifo rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
during periods of deflation  inventory values on the first in  first out retail inventory method fifo rim may be lower than the lifo rim method 
additionally  inventory values at lifo rim cost may be in excess of net realizable value 
at february  and january   the company reduced the value of inventories on lifo rim to the fifo rim value  which approximates market value 
cost of sales during fiscal  and under both the fifo rim and lifo rim methods was the same 
the remaining of the inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identified cost methods 
a change in the dollar amount of markdowns would have impacted net income by approximately million for fiscal 
table of contents the company regularly records a provision for estimated shrinkage  thereby reducing the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
complete physical inventories of all of the company stores and warehouses are performed no less frequently than annually  with the recorded amount of merchandise inventory being adjusted to coincide with these physical counts 
the differences between the estimated amounts of shrinkage and the actual amounts realized during the past three years have not been material 
revenue recognition 
the company retail operations segment recognizes revenue upon the sale of merchandise to its customers  net of anticipated returns of merchandise 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
we recorded an allowance for sales returns of million and million as of february  and january   respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision were not material for the years ended february   january  and january  the company share of income earned under the alliance with ge involving the dillard branded proprietary credit cards is included as a component of service charges and other income 
the company received income of approximately million  million and million from ge in fiscal  and  respectively 
pursuant to this alliance  the company has no continuing involvement other than to honor the proprietary cards in its stores 
although not obligated to a specific level of marketing commitment  the company participates in the marketing of the proprietary credit cards and accepts payments on the proprietary credit cards in its stores as a convenience to customers who prefer to pay in person rather than by paying online or mailing their payments to ge 
revenues from cdi construction contracts are generally recognized by applying percentages of completion for each period to the total estimated revenue for the respective contracts 
the length of each contract varies but is typically nine to eighteen months 
the percentages of completion are determined by relating the actual costs of work performed to date to the current estimated total costs of the respective contracts 
any anticipated losses on completed contracts are recognized as soon as they are determined 
vendor allowances 
the company receives concessions from vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  payroll reimbursements and margin maintenance programs 
cooperative advertising allowances are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising  which could increase or decrease our expenditures 
similarly  we are not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues  as such allowances do not directly generate revenues for our stores 
payroll reimbursements are reported as a reduction of payroll expense in the period in which the reimbursement occurred 
amounts of margin maintenance allowances are recorded only when an agreement has been reached with the vendor and the collection of the concession is deemed probable 
all such merchandise margin maintenance allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost purchases 
under lifo rim  a portion of these allowances reduces cost of goods sold and a portion reduces the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
insurance accruals 
the company consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to claims for self insured workers compensation with a self insured retention of million per claim and general liability with a self insured retention of million per claim and a one time million corridor 
the company retentions are insured through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 

table of contents the company estimates the required liability of such claims  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
as of february  and january   insurance accruals of million and million  respectively  were recorded in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
adjustments resulting from changes in historical loss trends have helped control expenses during fiscal and  partially due to company programs that have helped decrease both the number and cost of claims 
further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
a change in our self insurance reserve would have affected net earnings by million for fiscal long lived assets 
the company judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  or store closings 
the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if the company actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  changes in store locations  settlements of tax audits or tax planning  the company effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
changes in the company assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of february  and january  was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  would  if recognized  affect the effective tax rate 
the company classifies accrued interest expense and penalties relating to income tax in the consolidated financial statements as income tax expense 
the total interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated statements of income during fiscal  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the total accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheets as of february  and january  was million and million  respectively 
the company is currently under examination by various state and local taxing jurisdictions for various fiscal years 
the tax years that remain subject to examination for major tax jurisdictions are 
table of contents fiscal tax years and forward 
at this time  the company does not expect the results from any income tax audit to have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
the company has taken positions in certain taxing jurisdictions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months 
the possible decrease could result from the finalization of the company various state income tax audits and lapse of statutes of limitation 
the company does not expect a material change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months 
pension obligations 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the citigroup above median pension index curve on its annual measurement date and is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods 
the discount rate decreased to as of february  from as of january  we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the pension liability of million is appropriately stated as of february   however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a further basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the pension liability by approximately million 
the company expects to make a contribution to the pension plan of approximately million in fiscal the company expects pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal with a liability of million at february  results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations and percentage of net sales  for the periods indicated for the years ended february  january  january  in thousands of dollars amount of net sales amount of net sales amount of net sales net sales service charges and other income cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization rentals interest and debt expense  net gain on litigation settlement gain on disposal of assets asset impairment and store closing charges income before income taxes and income on equity in losses of joint ventures income taxes benefit income on equity in losses of joint ventures net income

fiscal in january  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary intended to operate as a real estate investment trust reit and transferred certain properties to this subsidiary 
the company entered into this transaction in order to enhance its financial flexibility by providing additional sources of liquidity 
at the time  the company believed that a tax election might be available to the company that would result in a taxable gain on the transfer of these properties to the reit 
in may  the company requested that the irs review the transaction and the potential tax election available to the company  through the irs voluntary pre filing agreement program pfa 
through the pfa  in september  the company and the irs entered into a closing agreement on final determination covering specific matters under which the irs agreed with the company regarding the tax treatment of the transfer of the properties to the reit and the availability of the tax election to the company 
based on the agreement with the irs reached during fiscal  the company determined to make the tax election in its tax return for the fiscal year ended january  fiscal 
this tax election increased the tax basis of the properties transferred to the reit to their fair values at the date of the transfer 
the income tax that would otherwise be payable because of the gain recognized by this election was largely reduced by the utilization of a capital loss carryforward  that would otherwise have expired as of january   against a portion of the recognized gain 
because of the company past uncertainty regarding the incurrence of capital gain income  the deferred tax asset associated with that capital loss carryforward had been offset by a full valuation allowance since its recognition in fiscal during fiscal  income taxes included the recognition of approximately million in tax benefit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to the amount of the capital loss carryforward used to offset the capital gain income recognized on the taxable transfer of 
table of contents the properties to the reit reit transaction 
approximately million of the tax benefit relates to increased basis in depreciable property while approximately million of the benefit relates to increased basis in land 
due to the increased tax basis of the depreciable properties transferred to the reit  the company will recognize increased tax depreciation deductions in the future which are expected to yield cash tax benefits of approximately million annually in years one through twenty and approximately million annually in years twenty one through forty beginning with the current year 
due to the uncertainty surrounding whether the reit will dispose of any of its land assets in the future  the company cannot estimate when or if the cash tax benefits related to the increased basis in land will be received

these tax benefits were partially offset by the recognition of tax expense of approximately million due to increases in net operating loss valuation allowances 
additionally  during fiscal  the irs concluded its examination of the company federal income tax returns for the fiscal tax years through  and no significant changes occurred in these tax years as a result of such examination

the alliance provides for certain payments to be made by ge to the company  including a revenue sharing and marketing reimbursement 
the company received income of approximately million and million from ge in fiscal and  respectively
