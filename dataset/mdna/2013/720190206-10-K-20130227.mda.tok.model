item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of december  and  and for the years ended december    and included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see also cautionary note regarding forward looking statements preceding part i of this report and risk factors set forth in item a 
of this report 
overview we are a fully integrated  self managed real estate investment trust specializing in the acquisition  ownership  management  development  and disposition of primarily high quality class a office buildings located in major us office markets and leased primarily to high credit quality tenants 
we operate as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 
our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse pdm and based on our december  equity market capitalization of billion  piedmont is the fifth largest office reit in the united states in comparison to the constituents of the bloomberg us office reit index 
our portfolio of commercial office buildings is primarily leased to large  credit worthy  government and corporate tenants  and the majority of our revenue is derived from our office properties in the ten largest us office markets based on rentable square footage  with the most significant concentration in the premier office markets of chicago  washington  dc  and the new york metropolitan area 
as of december   we owned and operated office properties excluding five buildings owned through unconsolidated joint ventures  which are located in metropolitan areas 
these office properties comprise million square feet  primarily class a commercial office space  and were and leased as of december  and  respectively 
during the three years ended december   we have been reducing the number of markets we operate within by selling non strategic assets and recycling the proceeds into assets and markets which we believe have the greatest potential to contribute to enterprise value over time 
in addition  during that same time frame  we have been working through a period of intense releasing activity due to the fact that many of our properties were acquired approximately ten years ago with typically seven to ten years of lease term remaining 
as a result a significant number of leases expired during the last three years 
during the years ended december  and  we executed new or renewal leases for million and million square feet  respectively 
on a combined basis  this equates to re leasing over a third of our total portfolio during the last two years 
liquidity and capital resources we intend to use cash flows generated from the operation of our wholly owned properties  distributions from our joint ventures  proceeds from selective property dispositions  and proceeds from our million unsecured line of credit as our primary sources of immediate liquidity 
depending on the timing and volume of our property acquisition and disposition activities and debt maturities  we may also seek other financing opportunities such as issuance of additional equity or debt securities or additional borrowings from third party lenders afforded to us based on our relatively low leverage and quality asset base as additional sources of capital  however  the availability and attractiveness of terms for these sources of capital is highly dependent on market conditions 
as of the time of this filing  we had million outstanding under our million unsecured line of credit 
as a result  we had approximately million under this facility available for future borrowing approximately million of capacity is reserved as security for outstanding letters of credit required by various third parties 
we estimate that our most consistent use of capital will be to fund capital expenditures for our existing portfolio of properties 
these expenditures include two types of specifically identified building improvement projects i general repair and maintenance projects that we as the owner may choose to perform at our discretion at any of our various properties and ii tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions that we have committed to as part of executed leases with our tenants 
due to the high lease rollover that we have been experiencing over the last several years  the majority of our recent capital expenditures have related to tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions 
during the years ended december  and  we spent approximately and per square foot per year of lease term  respectively  for such capital expenditures 
as of december   unrecorded contractual obligations for non incremental tenant improvements related to our existing lease portfolio totaled million 
the timing of the funding of these commitments is largely dependent upon tenant requests for reimbursement  however  we would anticipate that the majority of this amount would be requested over the next months as certain significant 
table of contents 
index to financial statements leases commence 
in some instances  these obligations may expire with the respective lease  without further recourse to us 
additionally  commitments for incremental capital expenditures associated with new leases  primarily at value add properties  total approximately million 
we also anticipate granting market based concession packages  typically consisting of tenant allowances and or rent abatement periods  and paying broker commissions in conjunction with negotiating future leases 
given that our model is to lease large blocks of space to credit worthy tenants  as evidenced by our average lease size of between  and  square feet  some of the concession packages that we grant can result in significant capital outlays 
in particular  over the next eighteen months there are three blocks of space in excess of  square feet in our washington  d 
c portfolio that will be subject to re leasing negotiations  and we may grant significant concession packages to secure new  or renew existing  tenants for those buildings 
both the timing and magnitude of these amounts have yet to be determined and are highly dependent on competitive market conditions at the time of lease negotiations 
subject to the identification and availability of attractive investment opportunities and our ability to consummate additional acquisitions on satisfactory terms  acquiring new assets compatible with our investment strategy could also be a significant use of capital 
further  our board of directors has authorized a repurchase program for our common stock for use when we believe that our stock is trading at a meaningful discount to what we believe the fair value of our assets to be 
as of december   there was million of authorized capacity remaining on that program which could be spent prior to the program expiration on november  on a longer term basis  we expect to use capital to repay debt when obligations become due 
we currently have no debt maturing in  however  we have million of secured debt maturing in subject to our assessment of market conditions  we currently anticipate refinancing these maturities with unsecured debt prior to their maturity dates in in anticipation of such an issuance and considering the historically low interest rate environment  we entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps  in november and january  totaling million to partially protect the company against rising interest rates and to lock a portion of the interest rate on any future unsecured debt issuance 
again  subject to our assessment of market conditions  we may enter into additional similar swaps during the next twelve months 
the amount and form of payment cash or stock issuance of future dividends to be paid to our stockholders will continue to be largely dependent upon i the amount of cash generated from our operating activities  ii our expectations of future cash flows  iii our determination of near term cash needs for debt repayments and selective acquisitions of new properties  iv the timing of significant expenditures for tenant improvements and general property capital improvements  v long term payout ratios for comparable companies  vi our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital  including potential sales of our properties  and vii the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a reit 
given the fluctuating nature of cash flows and expenditures  we may periodically borrow funds on a short term basis to cover timing differences in cash receipts and cash disbursements 
results of operations comparison of the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  vs 
the year ended december  income from continuing operations per share on a fully diluted basis decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  primarily due to the recognition of million  or per diluted share  in litigation settlement expense and approximately million  or per diluted share  in net casualty loss in the current year  whereas the prior year results included approximately million  or per diluted share  in gains and non recurring income associated with the foreclosure and consolidation of the w 
monroe building located in chicago  illinois and higher lease termination income

index to financial statements the following table sets forth selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and  respectively  as well as each balance as a percentage of total revenues for the years presented dollars in millions december  december  increase decrease revenue rental income tenant reimbursements property management fee revenue other rental income total revenues expense property operating costs depreciation amortization general and administrative expense real estate operating income other income expense interest expense interest and other income litigation settlement agreement net casualty loss equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on consolidation of variable interest entity gain on extinguishment of debt income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations revenue rental income for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  as compared to million in the prior year 
approximately million of the variance is attributable to the recognition of a full year rental revenue for properties acquired during the year ended december  additionally  several significant leases commenced in late or during the year ended december   contributing approximately million of the year over year increase 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in leased space due to lease expirations at various properties 
in many cases  we have since executed a new lease for the expiring space  but the new lease has not yet commenced 
although we have one significant governmental tenant in our washington  dc portfolio which is expected to vacate its space when its lease expires in march of  we anticipate the decrease in revenue associated with this expiration will be partially offset by the commencement of some of these previously executed leases 
tenant reimbursements decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to the expiration of several significant leases during the last several years 
in many cases  the expiring space has been re leased  however  the replacement lease was in some form of abatement during the year ended december  rental abatements  including operating expense reimbursement abatements  are frequently offered as part of a rental concession package in conjunction with negotiating a lease 
operating expense abatements are recognized in the period that they relate to  rather than on a straight line basis like rental abatements 
in addition  tenant reimbursement income related to properties acquired during the year ended december  contributed approximately million to offset the decline in tenant reimbursements related to lease expirations and abatements 
property management fee revenue increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of retaining the property management of the west wacker drive building in chicago  illinois subsequent to selling the building to an unrelated third party in december 
table of contents 
index to financial statements other rental income is comprised primarily of income recognized for lease terminations and restructurings 
unlike the majority of our rental income  which is recognized ratably over long term contracts  lease termination income is recognized once we have completed our obligation to provide space to the tenant 
such rental income is not comparable between existing or future periods  as it is dependent upon the exercise of lease terminations by particular tenants and or the execution of restructuring agreements that are deemed by management to be in the best interest of the portfolio over the long term 
generally  the million decrease in other rental income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due to fewer lease terminations during the current year as compared to the prior year 
expense property operating costs increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
approximately million of increase is due to the recognition of a full year operating expense related to properties acquired during the year ended december  in addition  we also incurred higher property tax expense of approximately million due to the non recurrence of certain favorable tax appeals recognized in the prior year  however  this increase was significantly offset by a decrease in utility costs of approximately million due to a milder winter 
depreciation expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
approximately million of this increase was attributable to depreciation on additional tenant improvements and building expenditures capitalized subsequent to january  the remainder of the increase is due to the recognition of a full year depreciation expense related to properties acquired during the year ended december amortization expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lease intangible assets becoming fully amortized at certain of our existing portfolio of properties subsequent to january  this decrease was partially offset by the acceleration of amortization expense on certain lease intangible assets related to a lease termination due to a tenant bankruptcy at our w 
monroe building  which contributed approximately million of additional expense compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower expense associated with our deferred stock compensation plan in the current period  as well as recoveries in excess of current period billings from our insurance carriers related to our litigation defense 
other income expense interest expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to the repayment of million of secured debt between november and may however  in november  we entered into a million unsecured term loan which has an effective interest rate of compared to the previous million unsecured term loan  which carried an effective rate of prior to its maturity in june the decrease in interest expense as a result of the secured debt pay offs noted above was partially offset by the higher interest rate and principal balance on the unsecured term loan 
interest and other income decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease primarily reflects the recognition in the prior period of previously deferred property operating income upon the successful foreclosure and consolidation of the w 
monroe building 
for the year ended december  we recognized million of litigation settlement expense related to potential settlement agreements of the two class action lawsuits which are pending approval 
see notes and of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail 
the approximate million net casualty loss we recognized during the year ended december  is due to damage incurred at certain of our assets in the new york new jersey markets as a result of hurricane sandy which occurred during the fourth quarter of the damaged properties include the broad street building in new york city  new york and the bridgewater crossing building in bridgewater  new jersey 
such damage resulted in expenses relating to equipment destroyed  costs to clean  repair  and establish emergency operations at the buildings  and rental abatements issued to tenants for business interruption due to their inability to access the space that they lease from us for certain periods of time 
these costs totaled approximately million and were offset by the recognition of approximately million in insurance recoveries 
we anticipate further recoveries related to hurricane sandy under our insurance programs in future periods 
the approximate million gain on the consolidation of vie recognized during the year ended december  was the net result of recording the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired through our foreclosure of the w 
monroe building 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the approximate million gain on the extinguishment of debt recognized during the year ended december  was the result of our paying off a million mezzanine loan on the w 
monroe building at a discount 
discontinued operations in accordance with gaap  the operations of the eastpointe corporate center in issaquah  washington  the corporate court building in holtsville  new york  the west wacker drive building  the deschutes building  the rhein building  the rogue building  and the willamette building  as well as acres of adjoining  undeveloped land in beaverton  oregon the portland portfolio  the enterprise way building in lake forest  california  and the and hidden lake circle buildings in duncan  south carolina are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the recognition of the gain on the sale of the west wacker drive building in december as well as a reduction in operating income in the current period from properties sold during the year ended december  we do not expect that income from discontinued operations will be comparable to future periods  as such income is subject to the timing and existence of future property dispositions 
comparison of the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  vs 
the year ended december  income from continuing operations per share on a fully diluted basis decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in property operating costs  and increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with properties acquired during and although rental income increased due to properties acquired during the same period  such rental income was negatively impacted by lower rental rates and reductions in leased space at certain of our existing properties 
additionally  we recognized non recurring  non cash gains of approximately million and million related to the consolidation of the vie containing the w 
monroe building and the early extinguishment of a million mezzanine loan on the building  respectively  during the year ended december  the following table sets forth selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and  respectively  as well as each balance as a percentage of total revenues for the years presented dollars in millions december  december  increase decrease revenue rental income tenant reimbursements property management fee revenue other rental income total revenues expense property operating costs depreciation amortization general and administrative expense real estate operating income other income expense interest expense interest and other income equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on consolidation of variable interest entity gain on extinguishment of debt income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations 
table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue rental income for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  as compared to million in the prior year 
approximately million of the variance is due to properties acquired during and  as well as increased occupancy at our piedmont pointe i and ii buildings in bethesda  maryland 
however  this increase was partially offset by a reduction in leased space due to the increased number of lease expirations and terminations over the past several years 
we also experienced lower rates for leases commencing in late or subsequent to december   primarily related to leases at our crown colony drive building in quincy  massachusetts and our west jefferson building in detroit  michigan  which further offset the aforementioned increases in rental revenues 
tenant reimbursements increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to properties acquired during and  which accounts for a million increase in tenant reimbursements 
this variance was largely offset by a decrease in property tax reimbursements due to successful appeals of the assessed values at several of our buildings of approximately million as well as a reduction in leased space primarily due to a significant lease expiration at our windy point ii building 
other rental income is comprised primarily of income recognized for lease terminations and restructurings 
unlike the majority of our rental income  which is recognized ratably over long term contracts  lease termination income is recognized once we have completed our obligation to provide space to the tenant 
we do not expect other rental income to be comparable in existing or future periods  as it is dependent upon the exercise of lease terminations by particular tenants and or the execution of restructuring agreements that are deemed by management to be in the best interest of the portfolio over the long term 
the most significant component of the approximately million in other rental income recognized during the year ended december  related to a lease termination at our eye street building of approximately million 
other rental income for the year ended december  relates primarily to a lease termination at our chandler forum building in chandler  arizona of approximately million 
expense property operating costs increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to this variance is due primarily to properties acquired during and  which accounts for an approximate million increase in property costs 
this variance was partially offset by lower estimated property tax expense of approximately million as a result of successful appeals of the assessed values at several of our buildings 
depreciation expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the variance is primarily attributable to properties acquired during and  comprising approximately million of the increase 
additionally  new tenant improvements and building expenditures capitalized at our existing properties subsequent to january  resulted in additional depreciation expense of approximately million 
amortization expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the increase is primarily attributable to properties acquired during and  accounting for approximately million of the increase  as well as acceleration of amortization expense on certain lease intangible assets related to various lease terminations at certain of our buildings 
the variance is partially offset by lower amortization expense recognized for lease intangible assets that became fully amortized subsequent to january  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to a change in our transfer agent in january and costs associated with our recapitalization of our common stock  listing of our common stock on the nyse  and other related investor support expenses in the decrease was partially offset by higher legal fees related to our defense of ongoing litigation 
other income expense interest expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate for our outstanding debt in the second half of after the million unsecured term loan matured in june and was replaced with borrowings on the million unsecured facility 
this decrease was partially offset by additional interest expense related to loans on the w 
monroe building assumed in march interest and other income decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the variance is attributable to an increase in acquisition costs of approximately million  due to greater building acquisition activity in the current period 

table of contents 
index to financial statements equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to as a result of the disposition of two unconsolidated joint venture properties in  the interlocken building in broomfield  colorado  and the kato road building in fremont  california 
we expect equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures to decrease as our unconsolidated joint ventures approach their stated dissolution periods 
the approximate million gain on the consolidation of variable interest entity vie recognized during the year ended december  was the net result of recording the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired through our foreclosure of the w 
monroe building 
the approximate million gain on the extinguishment of debt during is the result of our paying million to the respective lenders in full satisfaction of a million mezzanine loan on the w 
monroe building 
piedmont did not incur a defeasance or yield maintenance penalty but did incur approximately million of expense associated with the accelerated amortization of capitalized finance costs related to the loan 
discontinued operations in accordance with gaap  we have classified the operations of the sylvan avenue building in englewood cliffs  new jersey  the eastpointe corporate center  the corporate court building  the west wacker drive building  the portland portfolio  the enterprise way building  and the and hidden lake circle buildings as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to we realized a combined gain on the sale of our eastpointe corporate center  corporate court building  and the west wacker drive building of approximately million during there was no activity in at the sylvan avenue building as the property was sold in december funds from operations  core funds from operations  and adjusted funds from operations affo net income calculated in accordance with gaap is the starting point for calculating ffo  core ffo  and affo 
ffo  core ffo  and affo are non gaap financial measures and should not be viewed as an alternative measurement of our operating performance to net income 
management believes that accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  we believe that the use of ffo  core ffo  and affo  together with the required gaap presentation  provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing  and investing activities 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition as follows net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment charges including our proportionate share of any impairment charges and or gains or losses from sales of property related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do  therefore  our computation of ffo may not be comparable to such other reits 
we calculate core ffo as ffo calculated as set forth above less acquisition costs and other significant  non recurring items 
we calculate affo as core ffo calculated as set forth above exclusive of the net effects of i amortization associated with deferred financing costs  ii depreciation of non real estate assets  iii straight line lease revenue expense  iv amortization of above and below market lease intangibles  v stock based and other non cash compensation expense  vi amortization of mezzanine discount income  vii acquisition costs  and viii non incremental capital expenditures as defined below 
our proportionate share of such adjustments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are also included when calculating affo

includes adjustments for wholly owned properties including discontinued operations  as well as such adjustments for our proportionate ownership in unconsolidated joint ventures 
effective july   piedmont defines non incremental capital expenditures as capital expenditures of a recurring nature related to tenant improvements  leasing commissions  and building capital that do not incrementally enhance the underlying assets income generating capacity 
tenant improvements  leasing commissions  building capital and deferred lease incentives incurred to lease space that was vacant at acquisition  leasing costs for spaces vacant for greater than one year  leasing costs for spaces at newly acquired properties for which in place leases expire shortly after acquisition  improvements associated with the expansion of a building  and renovations that either change the underlying classification from a class b to a class a property or enhance the marketability of a building are excluded from this measure 
all prior periods presented have been recalculated in accordance with the new definition for comparability 
property and same store net operating income cash basis property net operating income property noi cash basis is a non gaap measure which we use to assess our operating results 
it is calculated as real estate operating income with the add back of corporate general and administrative expense  depreciation and amortization  and impairment losses and the deduction of income and expense associated with lease terminations and income associated with property management performed by piedmont for other organizations 
we present this measure on a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements cash basis  which eliminates the effects of straight lined rents and fair value lease revenue 
the company uses this measure as a proxy for the cash generated by our real estate properties 
same store net operating income same store noi is another non gaap measure very similar to property noi  however  same store noi only reflects property noi attributable to the properties owned or placed in service during the entire span of the current and prior year reporting periods 
same store noi excludes amounts attributable to unconsolidated joint venture assets 
we believe same store noi is an important measure because it allows us to compare the cash flows generated by our same real estate properties from one period to another 
other reits may calculate same store noi differently and our calculation should not be compared to that of other reits 
the following table sets forth our same store noi cash basis with a reconciliation to our net income attributable to common stockholders gaap basis for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands december  december  net income attributable to piedmont net income attributable to noncontrolling interest interest expense gain loss on extinguishment of debt depreciation amortization litigation settlement expense net casualty gain loss gain loss on sale of properties gain loss on consolidation of vie general administrative expenses management fee revenue interest and other income lease termination income lease termination expense straight line rent acquisition intangibles write offs straight line rent adjustment net effect of amortization of below market in place lease intangibles property noi cash basis acquisitions dispositions unconsolidated joint ventures same store noi change period over period in same store noi n a includes amounts attributable to consolidated properties  including discontinued operations  and our proportionate share of amounts attributable to unconsolidated joint ventures

table of contents 
index to financial statements due to the period of significant lease rollovers that we have been experiencing over the last several years  same store noi decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  although much of the space associated with expiring leases has been re leased  many of these replacement leases do not commence until future periods after extensive refurbishment of the space has occurred or  even if the lease has commenced  the new lease may be at lower rental rates or have contained some form of rental abatement 
additionally  in some cases replacement tenants have not yet been identified 
all of these items negatively impact same store noi on a cash basis  however  as our executed but not commenced leases begin and rental abatement periods expire  we expect there will be greater same store noi growth than might otherwise be expected based on changes in our overall leased percentage alone 
election as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our adjusted reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains attributable to our stockholders  as defined by the code 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we may be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income for that year and for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost and or penalties  unless the irs grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
however  we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit and intend to continue to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we have elected to treat piedmont office holdings  inc poh  a wholly owned subsidiary of piedmont  as a taxable reit subsidiary 
poh performs non customary services for tenants of buildings that we own  including real estate and non real estate related services  however  any earnings related to such services performed by our taxable reit subsidiary are subject to federal and state income taxes 
furthermore during  poh  through a wholly owned subsidiary piedmont power  llc  commenced a project to install solar panels at our bridgewater crossing building 
in addition  for us to continue to qualify as a reit  our investments in taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed of the value of our total assets 
inflation we are exposed to inflation risk  as income from long term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations 
there are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that are intended to protect us from  and mitigate the risk of  the impact of inflation 
these provisions include rent steps  reimbursement billings for operating expense pass through charges  real estate tax  and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis  or in some cases  annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square foot allowance 
however  due to the long term nature of the leases  the leases may not readjust their reimbursement rates frequently enough to fully cover inflation 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting policies have been established to conform with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  thus  resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements 
additionally  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
the critical accounting policies outlined below have been discussed with members of the audit committee of the board of directors 
investment in real estate assets we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our depreciable assets 
we consider the period of future benefit of the asset to determine the appropriate useful lives 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income 
the estimated useful lives of our assets by class are as follows 
table of contents 
index to financial statements buildings years building improvements years land improvements years tenant improvements shorter of economic life or lease term furniture  fixtures  and equipment years intangible lease assets lease term allocation of purchase price of acquired assets upon the acquisition of real properties  we allocate the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in place leases  based in each case on their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building are determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of the fair value of these assets 
we determine the as if vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions and other related costs 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance  and other operating expenses during the expected lease up periods based on current market conditions 
the fair values of above market and below market in place leases are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining terms of the leases  taking into consideration the probability of renewals for any below market leases 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are recorded as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the fair values of in place leases include direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant  opportunity costs associated with lost rentals that are avoided by acquiring an in place lease  and tenant relationships 
direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions  tenant improvements  and other direct costs and are estimated based on our consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease 
these direct costs are included in deferred lease costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the value of opportunity costs is calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease 
customer relationships are valued based on expected renewal of a lease or the likelihood of obtaining a particular tenant for other locations 
these lease intangibles are included in intangible lease assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
estimating the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets requires us to estimate market lease rates  property operating expenses  carrying costs during lease up periods  discount and capitalization rates  market absorption periods  and the number of years the property is held for investment 
the use of inappropriate estimates would result in an incorrect assessment of our purchase price allocations  which would impact the amount of our reported net income 
valuation of real estate assets and investments in joint ventures which hold real estate assets we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of the real estate and related intangible assets  both operating properties and properties under construction  in which we have an ownership interest  either directly or through investments in joint ventures  may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present for wholly owned properties  which indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered from the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  we adjust the real estate and related intangible assets to the fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  we assess the fair value of our investment  as compared to our carrying amount 
if we determine that the carrying value is greater than the fair value at any measurement date  we must also determine if such a difference is temporary in nature 
value fluctuations which are other than temporary in nature are then recorded to adjust the carrying value to the fair value amount 
projections of expected future cash flows require that we estimate future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements  property operating expenses  the number of months it takes to re lease the property  and the number

index to financial statements of years the property is held for investment  among other factors 
the subjectivity of assumptions used in the future cash flow analysis  including capitalization and discount rates  could result in an incorrect assessment of the property s fair value and  therefore  could result in the misstatement of the carrying value of our real estate and related intangible assets and our net income attributable to piedmont 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase accounting for business combinations  as well as costs incurred as part of the acquisition 
we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
such interim circumstances may include  but are not limited to  significant adverse changes in legal factors or in the general business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key personnel  or persistent declines in an entity s stock price below carrying value of the entity 
the test prescribed by authoritative accounting guidance is a two step test 
the first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the entity to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined by adjusting the trading price of the stock for various factors including  but not limited to i liquidity or transferability considerations  ii control premiums  and or iii fully distributed premiums  if necessary  multiplied by the common shares outstanding 
if such calculated fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further procedures or analysis is permitted or required 
however  if the carrying value exceeds the calculated fair value  goodwill is potentially impaired and step two of the analysis would be required 
step two of the test involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the entity from the entity s fair value calculated in step one of the test 
if the implied value of the goodwill the remainder left after deducting the fair values of the entity from its calculated overall fair value in step one of the test is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized 
we have determined through the testing noted above that there are no issues of impairment related to our goodwill as of december  investment in variable interest entities variable interest entities vies are defined by gaap as entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
if an entity is determined to be a vie  it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance  absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  or receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns 
generally  expected losses and expected residual returns are the anticipated negative and positive variability  respectively  in the fair value of the vie s net assets 
when we make an investment  we assess whether the investment represents a variable interest in a vie and  if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
incorrect assumptions or assessments may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary 
the result could be the consolidation of an entity acquired or formed in the future that would otherwise not have been consolidated or the non consolidation of such an entity that would otherwise have been consolidated 
we evaluate each investment to determine whether it represents variable interests in a vie 
further  we evaluate the sufficiency of the entities equity investment at risk to absorb expected losses  and whether as a group  the equity has the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
interest rate derivatives we periodically enter into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge our exposure to changing interest rates on variable rate debt instruments 
as required by gaap  we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
we reassess the effectiveness of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be highly effective and also to determine if the forecasted transactions remain highly probable 
currently  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the changes in fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as effective cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income oci  and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transactions occur 
changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  if any  would be recorded as gain loss on interest rate swap in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of the interest rate derivative agreement is recorded as interest rate derivative asset or as interest rate derivative liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts received or paid under interest rate derivative agreements are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated income statements as incurred 
all of our interest rate derivative agreements as of december  are designated as cash flow hedges

index to financial statements stock based compensation we have issued stock based compensation in the form of restricted stock to our employees and directors 
for employees  such compensation has been issued pursuant to our long term incentive compensation ltic program 
the ltic program is comprised of an annual restricted stock grant component and a multi year performance share component 
awards granted pursuant to the annual restricted stock component are considered equity awards and expensed straight line over the vesting period  with issuances recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
awards granted pursuant to the performance share component are considered liability awards and are expensed over the service period  with issuances recorded as a reduction to accrued expense 
the compensation expense recognized related to both of these award types is recorded as property operating costs for those employees whose job is related to property operation and as general and administrative expense for all other employees and directors in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
related party transactions and agreements there were no related party transactions during the three years ended december  off balance sheet arrangements we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
our off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in note unconsolidated joint ventures and note commitments and contingencies specifically related to operating lease obligations of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the unconsolidated joint ventures in which we invest are prohibited by their governing documents from incurring debt 
for further information regarding our commitments under operating lease obligations  see the notes of our accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the contractual obligations table below 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations total amounts include principal payments only 
we made interest payments of million  including interest rate swap cash settlements related to various interest rate swap agreements in force  during the year ended december  and expect to pay interest in future periods on outstanding debt obligations based on the rates and terms disclosed herein and in note of our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
includes the million unsecured term loan which has a stated variable rate  however  we entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively fix  exclusive of changes to our credit rating  the rate on this facility to through maturity 
as such  we estimate incurring  exclusive of changes to our credit rating  approximately million per annum in total interest comprised of combination of variable contractual rate and settlements under interest rate swap agreements through maturity in november item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future income  cash flows  and fair values of our financial instruments depend in part upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency  exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with any borrowings under our million unsecured line of credit and our million unsecured term loan 
as a result  the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk 
many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow primarily through a low to moderate level of overall borrowings  as well as managing the variability in rate fluctuations on our outstanding debt 
as such  a significant portion of our debt is based on fixed interest rates to hedge against instability in the credit markets  and we have effectively fixed the interest rate on our million unsecured term loan through interest rate swap agreements  provided that we maintain our corporate credit rating 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes

the variable rate debt outstanding as of december  is based on libor plus a specified margin or prime as elected by us at certain intervals 
an increase in the variable interest rate on the variable rate facilities constitutes a market risk  as a change in rates would increase or decrease interest incurred and therefore cash flows available for distribution to stockholders 
the current stated interest rate spread on the million unsecured line of credit is libor plus based on our current corporate credit rating 
a change in the interest rate on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio  or on the million unsecured term loan which is effectively fixed through interest rate swaps  impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
as of december   a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our interest expense as our variable rate debt is limited to our million unsecured line of credit which has million outstanding as of the date of this filing
