continued investment in our e commerce platforms increases our opportunities to market and sell on line 
also important to our growth are the small business customer referrals we receive through our deluxe business advantage program  which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses 
our relationships with financial institutions are important in helping us more deeply serve unique customer segments such as contractors  retailers and professional services firms 
in recent years  we have acquired companies which allow us to expand our marketing solutions and other services offerings  including additional web services  web to print capabilities and internet marketing services 
we expect sales of these higher growth products and services will continue to represent an increasing portion of our revenue 
specifically  during may  we acquired orangesoda  inc  a provider of internet marketing services specializing in search  mobile and social media campaign strategies for small businesses  for cash of million  net of cash acquired

during the past several years  we have increased our investment in promoting and strengthening the deluxe brand to increase brand awareness and loyalty 
during  we examined our marketing strategies  held focus groups  looked at large research studies  and shadowed small business owners while they worked 
through these efforts  we learned that the primary motivator for today small business owner has shifted from business growth to personal satisfaction 
this insight formed the basis of our new brand campaign  the redesign of our deluxe 
com website and updated training for our call center sales representatives 
in late  we implemented our new work happy advertising campaign intended to encourage small business owners to view us as a business partner who can provide many of the key elements they need to operate and promote their business  so the owners can focus instead on doing what they love and work happy 
as in our other two business segments  we continue our efforts within small business services to simplify processes  eliminate complexity and lower costs 
during  we closed our rockford  illinois printing facility and consolidated the work into other facilities 
during  we closed our crystal lakes  illinois business products fulfillment center  moving its operations into another facility  and in  we closed our colorado springs  colorado customer call center  moving the work to other facilities 
financial services our strategies within financial services are as follows optimize core check revenue streams and acquire new clients  expand sales of higher growth marketing solutions and other services that differentiate us from the competition  and continue to optimize our cost and expense structure 
we continue to focus on client retention and on acquiring new clients 
we added a new large financial institution client in the first quarter of and in the third quarter of we are also advancing our marketing solutions and other services offerings with customer acquisition  risk management  and other new services 
during april  we acquired substantially all of the assets of banker dashboard  llc  for million  comprised of million of cash and million of shares of our common stock plus related dividend equivalent payments 
banker dashboard provides online financial management tools that provide banks with a comprehensive daily view of their financial picture 
in march  we purchased substantially all of the assets of cornerstone customer solutions  llc cornerstone  for million

banker dashboard online financial management tools that provide financial institutions with a comprehensive daily view of their financial picture 
deluxe provent sm a comprehensive suite of identity protection services 
deluxe detect a new account applicant screening tool 
we expect providing products and services that differentiate us from the competition will help partially offset the impacts of the decline in check usage and the competitive pricing pressures we are experiencing in our check programs 
as such  we also continue to focus on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services 
as in our other two business segments  financial services continues to simplify processes  eliminate complexity and lower costs 
during  we closed our financial services customer call center located in phoenix  arizona  moving the work to other facilities 
direct checks our strategies within direct checks are as follows maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features  accessories and products  continue to optimize our cost and expense structure  and optimize cash flow 
in april  we acquired custom direct  inc  a provider of direct to consumer checks  in a cash transaction for million  net of cash acquired 
we have leveraged this acquisition to build a best in class  direct to consumer check experience 
additionally  we continue to identify opportunities to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas  particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment 
we continue to actively market our products and services through targeted advertising  including a continued focus on the internet channel 
we continue to explore avenues to increase sales to existing customers 
one example is our ezshield tm offering  a check protection service that provides reimbursement to consumers for losses resulting from forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks 
as in our other two business segments  direct checks continues to simplify processes  eliminate complexity and lower costs 
during  we consolidated our little rock  arkansas and joppa  maryland call centers into our colorado springs call center and closed our joppa  maryland printing facility  moving the production to other facilities 
cost reduction initiatives for several years we have been pursuing cost reduction and business simplification initiatives  including reducing shared services infrastructure costs  streamlining our call center and fulfillment activities  eliminating system and work stream redundancies  and strengthening our ability to quickly develop new products and services and bring them to market 
we have reduced stock keeping units skus  standardized products and services and improved the sourcing of third party goods and services 
as a result of all of these efforts  we realized net cost savings of approximately million during  as compared to our results of operations  generated primarily by our sales and marketing  fulfillment  and information technology organizations 
approximately of these savings impacted selling  general and administrative sg a expense  with the remaining affecting cost of revenue 
we anticipate that we will realize additional net cost reductions of approximately million in  as compared to our results of operations  which will be generated primarily by our sales  marketing and fulfillment organizations 
approximately  of these savings are expected to impact sg a expense  with the remaining affecting cost of revenue 
outlook for we anticipate that consolidated revenue will be between billion and billion for  compared to billion for in small business services  we expect the percentage increase in revenue to be in the high single digits compared to revenue of million  as volume declines in core business products are expected to be more than offset by benefits from our e commerce investments  price increases and growth in our distributor  dealer and major accounts channels and in our marketing solutions and other services offerings  including incremental revenue from the orangesoda acquisition in may in financial services  we expect the percentage decrease in revenue to be in the mid single digits compared to revenue of million  driven by check order declines of approximately five to six percent  partially offset by continued growth in non check revenue  as well as price increases 
in direct checks  we expect the percentage decrease in revenue to be in the middle to high single digits compared to revenue of million  driven by check volume declines 
we expect that diluted earnings per share will be between and  compared to for  which included total charges of per share related to restructuring related costs  losses on debt retirements and transaction costs related to acquisitions 
we expect that the benefits of additional cost reduction activities will be partially offset by increases in material and delivery rates and continued investments in revenue growth opportunities 
we have also assumed in our outlook that the economy will remain sluggish 
we estimate that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately 
we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities will be between million and million in  compared to million in  driven by higher earnings and lower contributions to our trust used to fund medical benefits  partially offset by higher income tax and employee profit sharing cash bonus payments 
we anticipate contract acquisition payments of approximately million in  and we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million in as we continue to invest in key revenue growth initiatives and order fulfillment and information technology infrastructure 
we believe that cash generated by operating activities  along with our credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operations  including capital expenditures  required debt service  dividend payments and small to medium sized acquisitions  for the next months 
we are focused on a disciplined approach to capital deployment that focuses on our need to continue investing in initiatives to drive revenue growth  including small to medium sized acquisitions 
we also anticipate that our board of directors will maintain our current dividend level 
however  dividends are approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis  and thus are subject to change 
we also anticipate that we will repurchase shares to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under our employee stock incentive plan 
to the extent we have cash flow in excess of these priorities  we plan to accumulate cash in advance of our october senior note maturity  and we may from time to time consider retiring outstanding debt through open market repurchases  privately negotiated transactions or other means 
business challenges market risks market for checks and business forms the market for our two largest products  checks and business forms  is very competitive 
these products are mature and their use has been declining 
the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline for many years as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines  direct deposit  and electronic and other bill paying services 
according to a federal reserve study released in december  the most recent information available  approximately billion checks were written in according to this study  checks are no longer the largest single non cash payment method in the united states  being surpassed by the debit card 
checks written account for approximately of all non cash payment transactions  which is a reduction from the federal reserve study released in december when checks accounted for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
the federal reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately per year between and we expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline 
however  we cannot predict the rate at which this decline will continue in the long term 
in addition to the decline in check usage  the use of business forms is also under pressure 
continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  off the shelf business software applications  electronic transaction systems and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre printed business forms products 
financial institution clients because check usage is declining  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
financial institutions seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated from their check programs  despite the decline in check usage 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through check supply contracts averaging three to six years in duration 
as we compete to retain and acquire new financial institution business  the resulting pricing pressure  combined with declining check usage in the marketplace  has negatively impacted our revenue and profit margins 
we expect these trends to continue 
turmoil in the financial services industry  which began in late  led to increases in bank failures and consolidations 
there could be a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations if we were to lose a significant amount of business and or we were unable to recover the value of unamortized contract acquisition costs or accounts receivable 
as of december   unamortized contract acquisition costs totaled million  while liabilities for contract acquisition costs not paid as of december  were million 
the inability to recover amounts paid to one or more of our larger financial institution clients could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the consolidation of financial institutions may also impact our results of operations 
in the past we have occasionally acquired new clients as financial institutions that were not our clients consolidated with our clients 
when two of our financial institution clients consolidate  the increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by the consolidated entity could result in a new contract which is not as favorable to us as those historically negotiated with the clients individually 
however  we may also generate non recurring conversion revenue when obsolete checks have to be replaced after one financial institution merges with or acquires another 
conversely  we have also lost financial institution clients when they consolidated with financial institutions which were not our clients 
if we were to lose a significant amount of business in this manner  it could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in such situations  we have typically collected contract termination payments and we may be able to do so in similar circumstances in the future 
recent legislation has impacted our financial institution clients 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act was enacted in the act implements changes that  among other things  affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions  create a new agency responsible for implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws and introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements 
the full impact of the act and or any additional related regulatory changes remains unclear 
it is likely that the act has and will have a negative impact on the profitability of our financial institution clients as they incur costs to comply with the new regulations 
in spite of these additional costs  financial institutions may seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated  and they may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers  including their check providers 
the increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions 
additionally  the act gave the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair  deceptive or abusive practices 
this has made some financial institutions wary of offering add on services  such as fraud identity protection or expedited check delivery  to their customers  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are unable to market such services through our financial institution clients 
competition the small business forms and supplies industry and the small business marketing solutions and other services industries are highly fragmented with many small local suppliers  large national retailers and internet based providers 
we believe we are well positioned in this competitive landscape through our broad customer base  the breadth of our small business product and service offerings  multiple distribution channels  established relationships with our financial institution and telecommunications clients  competitive prices  high quality and dependable service 
in the small business forms and supplies industry  the competitive factors influencing a customer purchase decision are breadth of product line  speed of delivery  product quality  price  convenience  customer service and past experience with the supplier 
our primary competitors are office product superstores  local printers  business forms dealers and internet based suppliers 
local printers provide personalization and customization and offer a local relationship  but typically have a limited variety of products and services  as well as limited printing sophistication 
office superstores offer a variety of products at competitive prices  but provide limited personalization and customization 
we are aware of numerous competitors offering printed products and business supplies to small businesses through the internet  direct mail  distributors or a direct sales force 
many of our marketing solutions and other services offerings also face intense competition  including competition from internet based service providers 
with relatively low barriers to entry for the services we offer  we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future from other established and emerging companies 
the competitive factors affecting marketing solutions and other services offerings include the breadth  quality and ease of use of web and other services  price  and the responsiveness and quality of customer support 
in the check printing portion of the payments industry  we face considerable competition from other check printers  and we expect competition to remain intense as check usage continues to decline and financial institutions continue to consolidate 
we also face competition from check printing software vendors 
moreover  the check product must compete with alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines  direct deposit  and electronic and other bill paying services 
in the financial institution check printing business  there are two large primary providers  one of which is deluxe 
the principal factors on which we compete are product and service breadth  price  quality and check merchandising program management 
we believe the key items which differentiate us from our competition include our fully automated flat check delivery package  our online performance dashboard and portal analytics tools for financial institution branches  our personalized customer call center experience  and our deluxe business advantage program  which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses 
at times  check suppliers have reduced the prices of their products during the supplier selection process in an attempt to gain greater volume 
the corresponding pricing pressure has negatively impacted our profit margins 
pricing pressure will continue to impact our results of operations through lower pricing levels or client losses 
additionally  product discounts in the form of cash incentives payable to financial institutions upon contract execution have been a practice within the industry since the late s 
both the number of financial institution clients requesting these payments and the size of the payments has fluctuated significantly in recent years 
these up front payments negatively impact check printers cash flows at the beginning of the contract 
we make an effort to reduce the use of up front product discounts by structuring new contracts with incentives throughout the duration of the contract 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
continued competition could result in additional price reductions  reduced profit margins  loss of customers and an increase in up front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal  all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
economic conditions domestic and global economic conditions have affected and  most likely  will continue to affect our results of operations and financial position 
current and future economic conditions that affect business spending  including the availability of credit and small business confidence  as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers  may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the small business market is impacted by general economic conditions and the rate of small business formations 
the index of small business optimism published by the national federation of independent business nfib was in january and ended the year at  the second lowest index since march  and of small business owners characterize the current period as a bad time to expand 
the nfib december report also showed that of business owners believe conditions will be worse in six months  while only expect an improvement 
forward labor market indicators are also weak  and small business owners view of the future does not foresee much improvement in economic growth 
on a positive note  according to the most recent estimates of the small business administration office of advocacy  there was a slight increase in the number of small businesses created in  as compared to  the most recent information available 
we believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger  more established companies 
during a sluggish economy  it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services 
we cannot predict whether these negative economic trends will improve or worsen in the near future 
over the past four years  we believe the economy negatively impacted our operating results and or our growth opportunities  and we expect the economic environment will continue to be challenging in consolidated results of operations consolidated revenue change in thousands  except per order amounts vs

total revenue orders revenue per order the increase in total revenue for  as compared to  was primarily due to price increases in all three segments  incremental revenue of million generated by the businesses acquired during and  growth in our small business services distributor channel and in marketing solutions and other services  and revenue from a new large financial institution client 
these revenue increases were partially offset by lower order volume for our personal check businesses and continued pricing pressure on contract renewals within financial services 
the increase in total revenue for  as compared to  was primarily due to price increases in all three segments  incremental revenue of million from the acquisition of custom direct in april  revenue generated by the businesses acquired during  growth in the small business services distributor channel  and a favorable currency exchange rate impact of million 
these revenue increases were partially offset by lower order volume for our personal check businesses  revenue of million in from a contract settlement  continued pricing pressure within financial services  and the recognition of deferred revenue in from a contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of the revenue of million from the contract settlement recognized in accounted for a revenue decrease of percentage points in it related to a settlement with a large financial institution that acquired one of our clients and chose to consolidate its check printing business with another provider 
this business transitioned during the third quarter of and the contract termination payments were included in revenue in our small business services and financial services segments 
revenue from a new contract acquisition which began generating revenue during the third quarter of offset the revenue lost from this contract termination 
the recognition of financial services deferred revenue in related to a contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of accounted for a revenue decrease of percentage point in service revenue represented of total revenue in  in and in as such  the majority of our revenue is generated by product sales 
we do not manage our business based on product versus service revenue 
instead we analyze our products and services based on the following categories change vs

revenue per order increased for  as compared to  primarily due to the benefit of price increases in all three segments and a shift to higher dollar small business services orders as check usage continues to decline 
at the same time  financial services continues to experience pricing pressure on contract renewals 
the number of orders decreased for  as compared to  due primarily to the continuing decline in check and forms usage  partially offset by the addition of custom direct orders  which increased orders percentage points as compared to revenue per order increased for  as compared to  primarily due to the benefit of price increases  partially offset by revenue of million in from a contract settlement  continued pricing pressure within financial services  and the recognition of deferred revenue in from a financial services contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of the million contract settlement in increased revenue per order by percentage points in consolidated gross margin change in thousands vs 
vs 
gross profit gross margin pt 
as with revenue  we do not separately analyze gross margin generated by product sales and service sales 
instead  we evaluate gross margin on a consolidated basis when analyzing our consolidated results of operations to gain important insight into significant profit drivers 
as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from the sale of manufactured and purchased products  we believe the measure of gross margin best demonstrates our manufacturing and distribution performance  as well as the impact of pricing on our profitability 
gross margin is not a complete measure of profitability  as it omits sg a expense 
however  it is a financial measure which we believe is useful in evaluating our results of operations 
gross margin increased for  as compared to  due primarily to the benefit of price increases  as well as manufacturing and delivery efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our continued cost reduction initiatives 
partially offsetting these increases in gross margin were higher delivery rates and material costs and increased performance based compensation in gross margin for was the same as in manufacturing and delivery efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our continued cost reduction initiatives  as well as the benefit of price increases  were offset by the million contract settlement in  higher material costs and delivery rates  and the recognition of deferred revenue in from a financial services contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of the million contract settlement in contributed percentage points to gross margin in consolidated selling  general administrative expense change in thousands vs

sg a expense sg a expense as a percentage of total revenue pt 
pt 
the increase in sg a expense for  as compared to  was driven primarily by increased small business services commission expense due to increased volume  higher performance based compensation  incremental operating expenses of the businesses we acquired in and  and investments in revenue generating initiatives  including efforts to grow our small business services distributor channel and increase brand awareness 
these increases were partially offset by various expense reduction initiatives within sales  marketing and our shared services organizations  including improved labor and advertising efficiency  as well as lower acquisition related amortization related to previous acquisitions 
the increase in sg a expense for  as compared to  was driven primarily by operating expenses of the businesses we acquired in and the acquisition of custom direct in april  and increased small business services commission expense driven by increased volume  as well as marketing investments in our brand positioning and business development initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by various expense reduction initiatives within sales and marketing and our shared services organizations  as well as the discontinuation of contributions to our defined contribution pension plan in  which reduced sg a expense approximately million for  as compared to  and lower acquisition related amortization related to previous acquisitions

net restructuring charges we recorded restructuring charges and reversals related to the cost reduction initiatives discussed under executive overview 
the charges and reversals for each period primarily relate to costs of our restructuring activities such as employee severance benefits and other direct costs of our initiatives  including employee and equipment moves  training and travel 
in addition to the restructuring charges shown here  restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in were included within cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income

the decrease in interest expense for  as compared to  was due to our lower average debt level in  as well as charges of million in the first quarter of related to the retirement of long term notes

these decreases in interest expense were partially offset by our slightly higher average interest rate in the increase in interest expense for  as compared to  was due  in part  to our higher average interest rate in also contributing to the increase in interest expense were the charges of million discussed earlier driven by the retirement of long term notes during the first quarter of these increases in interest expense were partially offset by our lower average debt level in income tax provision change in thousands vs

the decrease in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was due  in part  to discrete income tax expense in  which increased our effective tax rate by points 
the largest discrete item in was a million charge resulting from the health care and education reconciliation act of  which was signed into law in march  and requires that certain tax deductions after be reduced by the amount of medicare part d subsidy payments 
prior to this law change  the subsidy was to be disregarded in all future years when computing tax deductions 
this resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax asset associated with our postretirement benefit plan 
our tax rate decreased points due to actions taken to restore a portion of this deferred tax asset 
in addition  our effective tax rate for included a number of discrete items  including adjustments to receivables for amendments to prior year tax returns  which collectively decreased our tax rate by points 
restructuring costs during  we recorded net restructuring charges of million 
this amount included expenses related to our restructuring activities  including employee and equipment moves  training and travel  which were expensed as incurred  as well as net restructuring accruals of million 
the restructuring accruals included charges of million related to severance for employee reductions in various functional areas as we continue to reduce costs  including the closing of two customer call centers during the third quarter of and two printing facilities during the fourth quarter of the restructuring accruals included severance benefits for approximately employees 
these charges were reduced by the reversal of million of restructuring accruals recorded primarily in previous years  as fewer employees received severance benefits than originally estimated 
the majority of the employee reductions included in our restructuring accruals are expected to be completed by mid  and we expect most of the related severance payments to be paid by the end of  utilizing cash from operations 
during  we recorded net restructuring charges of million

we plan to accumulate cash in advance of our october senior note maturity  and we may from time to time consider retiring outstanding debt through open market repurchases  privately negotiated transactions or other means 
we had million available for borrowing under our credit facility as of december  we believe that cash generated by operating activities  along with our credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operations in  including capital expenditures  required debt service  dividend payments and possible small to medium sized acquisitions

any such repurchases or exchanges would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements and other potential uses of cash  including acquisitions or share repurchases 
as of december   we had a million credit facility  which expires in february our commitment fee ranges from to based on our leverage ratio 
borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our personal and intangible property 
the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains customary covenants regarding limits on levels of subsidiary indebtedness and capital expenditures  liens  investments  acquisitions  certain mergers  certain asset sales outside the ordinary course of business  and change in control as defined in the agreement 
the agreement also contains financial covenants regarding our leverage ratio  interest coverage and liquidity

these letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility 
other financial position information contract acquisition costs other non current assets include contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment 
these costs  which are essentially pre paid product discounts  are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
cash payments made for contract acquisition costs were million for  million for and million for we anticipate cash payments of approximately million in changes in contract acquisition costs during the years ended december were as follows in thousands balance  beginning of year additions amortization other balance  end of year the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or acquire clients 
both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
liabilities for contract acquisition payments are recorded upon contract execution 
these obligations are monitored for each contract and are adjusted as payments are made 
contract acquisition payments due within the next year are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals were million as of december  and million as of december  accruals for contract acquisition payments included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december  and million as of december  foreign cash and investments as of december   our subsidiaries located in canada held cash and marketable securities of million 
deferred income taxes have not been recognized on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as these amounts are intended to be reinvested indefinitely in the operations of those subsidiaries 
if we were to repatriate the cash and marketable securities into the us  we would incur a us tax liability of approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements or to guarantee the performance of third parties 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass third party claims arising from our products and services  including service failures  breach of security  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of the terms of the contract 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks  including  for example  unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that any possible liability under these indemnities would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  annual results of operations or annual cash flows 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters 
further information can be found under the caption note other commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in the item of this report 
we are not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity or on our access to  or requirements for  capital resources 
in addition  we have not established any special purpose entities 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands total and and and thereafter long term debt and related interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total contractual obligations purchase obligations include amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for direct checks direct mail advertising agreements  information technology services and amounts due under direct checks and financial services royalty agreements 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here  as our business partners typically allow us to cancel these purchase orders as necessary to accommodate business needs 
of the purchase obligations included in the table above  million allow for early termination upon the payment of early termination fees 
if we were to terminate these agreements  we would have incurred early termination fees of million as of december  other non current liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  consisted primarily of amounts due for environmental matters and contract acquisition costs  derivative liabilities  and liabilities for uncertain tax positions and deferred compensation 
of the million reported as other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the obligations shown in the table above 
the excluded amounts  including the current portion of each liability  are comprised primarily of the following payments for uncertain tax positions due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time frame often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
our liability for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of december   excluding tax benefits of deductible interest and the federal benefit of deductible state income tax 
insured environmental remediation costs as of december   million of the costs included in our environmental accruals are covered by an environmental insurance policy which we purchased in the related receivables from the insurance company are reflected in other current assets and other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets based on the amounts of our environmental accruals for insured sites 
uninsured environmental accruals of million as of december  are included in the table above 
fair value of interest rate swaps as of december   other non current liabilities included million for the fair value of interest rate swaps related to our long term debt due in a portion of the amount due under our deferred compensation plan under this plan  some employees may begin receiving payments upon the termination of employment or disability  and we cannot predict when these events will occur 
as such  million of our deferred compensation liability as of december  is excluded from the obligations shown in the table above 
total contractual obligations do not include the following benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan we have contributed funds to this plan for the purpose of funding our obligations 
thus  we have the option of paying benefits from the assets of the plan or from the general funds of the company 
additionally  we expect the plan assets to earn income over time 
as such  we cannot predict when or if payments from our general funds will be required 
we do anticipate that we will utilize plan assets to pay a portion of our benefits during our postretirement benefit plan was overfunded million as of december  payments to our k plan payments to our k plan throughout the year are dependent on the number of employees participating in the plan  the level of employee contributions and employee wage rates 
profit sharing and cash bonus payments amounts payable under our profit sharing and cash bonus plans are dependent on our operating performance 
income tax payments  which are dependent upon our earnings 
related party transactions we have not entered into any material related party transactions during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
our accounting policies are discussed under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
application of critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  or which place the most significant demands on management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in interim reporting periods  we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based on the facts available at the time 
changes in the jurisdictional mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact our estimated effective tax rate in interim periods 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the interim period during which the unusual or one time item occurred 
the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense  net of the expected tax benefit  in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we had net deferred tax liabilities of million as of december   including valuation allowances of million 
as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities of million  including valuation allowances of million 
the valuation allowances related primarily to capital loss carryforwards in canada and net operating loss carryforwards in ireland which we do not expect to fully realize 
we are subject to tax audits in numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
tax audits are often complex and can require several years to complete 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to challenges from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions  or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we recognize the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements when they are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties and the federal benefit of deductible state income tax 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would positively affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   we had accrued million of interest and penalties  excluding the tax benefit of deductible interest 
the statute of limitations for federal tax assessments for and prior years has closed 
our federal income tax returns through have been audited by the irs  and our returns for through remain subject to irs examination 
in general  income tax returns for the years through remain subject to examination by foreign  state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution would result in reduced income tax expense 
changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the last three years can be found under the caption note income tax provision of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
within the next months  it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change in the range of a decrease of million to an increase of million as we attempt to settle certain federal and state matters or as federal and state statutes of limitations expire 
we are not able to predict what  if any  impact these changes may have on our effective tax rate or cash flows 
during  we recorded income tax expense of million to reduce our deferred tax asset related to our postretirement benefit plan 
this expense resulted from the health care and education reconciliation act of  which was signed into law in march  and requires that certain tax deductions after be reduced by the amount of medicare part d subsidy payments 
prior to this law change  the subsidy was to be disregarded in all future years when computing tax deductions 
during and  we took actions to restore approximately million of this deferred tax asset 
postretirement benefit plan detailed information regarding our postretirement benefit plan  including a description of the plan  its related future cash flows  plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plan  can be found under the caption note pension and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
our net postretirement benefit expense was million for  million for and million for our business segments record postretirement benefit expense in cost of revenue and in sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our postretirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
the effects of changes to our assumptions are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into earnings over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our postretirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods are impacted 
discount rate the discount rate is used to reflect the time value of money 
it is the assumed rate at which future postretirement benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows approximate the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the aon hewitt aa above median curve and the citigroup pension discount yield curves to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
the discount rate established at year end for purposes of calculating our benefit obligation is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit expense for the following year 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million  and would increase or decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
in determining this rate  we utilize our historical returns and then adjust these returns for estimated inflation and projected market returns 
our inflation assumption is primarily based on analysis of historical inflation data 
in measuring net postretirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
expected health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be for participants under the age of and for participants aged and older 
our ultimate health care inflation rate was assumed to be in and beyond for participants under the age of and in and beyond for participants aged and older 
a one percentage point change in the health care inflation rate for each year would have the following effects in thousands one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on benefit obligation average remaining life expectancy of plan participants in determining the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  our actuaries use a mortality table which includes estimated death rates for each age 
we use the rp combined healthy participant table with fully generational projection 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
the gain or loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated balance sheet within accumulated comprehensive loss and is amortized into postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants  as a large percentage of our plan participants are classified as inactive 
this amortization period was years as of december  the fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets is subject to various risks  including credit  interest and overall market volatility risks 
during  the equity markets experienced a significant decline in value  resulting in a significant decrease in the fair value of our plan assets 
this materially affected the funded status of the plan and resulted in higher postretirement benefit expense in subsequent years 
if the equity and bond markets decline in future periods  the funded status of our plan could again be materially affected 
this could result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future  as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund the benefits payable under the plan  although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable 
we did not use plan assets to make benefit payments during or rather  we used cash provided by operating activities to make these payments 
we do anticipate that we will utilize plan assets to pay a portion of our benefits during revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of products for which revenue is recognized upon shipment or customer receipt  based upon the transfer of title 
our services  which account for the remainder of our revenue  consist primarily of web hosting and applications services  fraud prevention  search engine optimization and marketing  financial institution customer acquisition programs  and payroll services 
we recognize these service revenues as the services are provided 
in some situations  our web hosting and applications services are billed on a quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
when a customer pays in advance for services  we defer the revenue and recognize it as the services are performed 
up front set up fees related to our web hosting and applications services are deferred and recognized as revenue on the straight line basis over the term of the customer relationship 
deferred revenue is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
revenue includes amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling and pass through costs  such as marketing materials for which our financial institution clients reimburse us 
costs incurred for shipping and handling and pass through costs are reflected in cost of products sold 
for sales with a right of return  we record a reserve for estimated sales returns based on significant historical experience 
at times  a financial institution client may terminate its contract with us prior to the end of the contract term 
in many of these cases  the financial institution is contractually required to remit a contract termination payment 
such payments are recorded as revenue when the termination agreement is executed  provided that we have no further service or contractual obligations  and collection of the funds is assured 
if we have a continuing service obligation following the execution of a contract termination agreement  we record the related revenue over the remaining service period 
revenue is presented in the consolidated statements of income net of rebates  discounts  amortization of contract acquisition costs and sales tax 
we enter into contractual agreements with financial institution clients for rebates on certain products we sell 
we record these amounts as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and as accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when the related revenue is recorded 
at times we may also sell products at discounted prices or provide free products to customers when they purchase a specified product 
discounts are recorded as reductions of revenue when the related revenue is recorded 
the cost of free products is recorded as cost of goods sold when the revenue for the related order is recorded 
reported revenue for our financial services segment does not reflect the full retail price paid by end consumers to their financial institutions 
revenue reflects the amounts paid to us by our financial institution clients 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible goodwill and our indefinite lived trade name are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
in addition to the required impairment analyses  we regularly evaluate the remaining useful life of our indefinite lived trade name to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we would determine that this asset has a finite useful life  we would test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset remaining carrying value over its estimated remaining useful life 
in completing our and annual goodwill impairment analyses  we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for all of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
these qualitative analyses evaluated factors including  but not limited to  economic  market and industry conditions  cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units 
we also considered the quantitative analysis we completed as of july  in which the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by amounts between million and million  or by amounts between and above the carrying values of their net assets 
in completing our qualitative analysis  we noted no changes in events or circumstances which would have required us to complete the two step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for any of our reporting units 
during  a two step  quantitative approach was required in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
first  we calculated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned and compared this estimated fair value to the carrying amount of its net assets 
in calculating the estimated fair value  we utilized the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant 
using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques  we projected revenue for the next five years 
we applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows 
a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream 
future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value 
the discount rate used was the value weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics 
in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units  we were required to estimate a number of factors  including projected future operating results  terminal growth rates  economic conditions  anticipated future cash flows  the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items 
for reasonableness  the summation of our reporting units fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization plus an appropriate control premium 
if the carrying amount of any of our reporting unit net assets had exceeded its estimated fair value  we would have been required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis 
this step would have required us to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  is estimated 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis for any of our reporting units 
the estimate of fair value for our indefinite lived trade name is based on a relief from royalty method  which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name 
an assumed royalty rate is applied to forecasted revenue and the resulting cash flows are discounted 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the annual impairment analysis completed during indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived trade name exceeded its carrying value of million by approximately million 
in this analysis  we assumed a discount rate of and a royalty rate of 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by approximately million and a one half percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by approximately million 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future events  market conditions  and financial performance over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from our assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals as  on some occasions  employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from our actual costs  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
we reversed previously recorded restructuring accruals of million in  million in and million in  primarily as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated 
further information regarding our restructuring accruals can be found under the caption note restructuring charges of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report

 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
under this new guidance  companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired  then a quantitative assessment must be completed 
this new standard is effective for us as of january  we had the option of adopting this standard early during the third quarter of instead  we elected to complete a quantitative analysis of the fair value of our indefinite lived trade name  which is described under the caption note fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires companies to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  companies are required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  companies are required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the new standard is effective for us as of january  as such  we will begin including the required disclosures in our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of december   our total debt was comprised of the following in thousands carrying amount fair value weighted average interest rate long term notes maturing october  including increase of  related to the cumulative change in fair value of hedged debt long term notes maturing march long term notes maturing november  including decrease of  related to the cumulative change in fair value of hedged debt total debt for our long term notes due in and  fair value is based on quoted market prices as of december  for identical liabilities when traded as assets 
for our long term notes due in  fair value is based on a pricing model using utilizing readily observable market interest rates 
we may  from time to time  retire outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements and other potential uses of cash  including acquisitions or share repurchases 
we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our long term debt 
as of december   interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million were designated as fair value hedges 
the carrying amount of long term debt as of december  included a million decrease related to adjusting the hedged debt for changes in its fair value 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the related long term debt are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
when the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the hedged debt are not equal ie  hedge ineffectiveness  the difference in the changes in fair value affects the reported amount of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
information regarding hedge ineffectiveness can be found under the caption note fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
based on the outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio  a one percentage point change in interest rates would have resulted in a million change in interest expense for  excluding any hedge ineffectiveness related to our interest rate swaps 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
investments in  loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  as well as the operations of these businesses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
the effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our results of operations and cash flows  as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business
