item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
overview the largest portion of our business is devoted to coal mining in the state of indiana through sunrise coal llc a wholly owned subsidiary serving the electric power generation industry 
we also own a equity interest in savoy energy  lp  a private oil and gas exploration company with operations in michigan and a interest in sunrise energy  llc  a private gas exploration company with operations in indiana 
we account for our investments in savoy and sunrise energy using the equity method 
historically  through our denver operations  we also lease oil and gas mineral rights with the intent to sell the prospects to third parties and retain an overriding royalty interest orri or carried interest 
in mid july we decided to substantially reduce these activities and our geologist who developed these prospects now works for us on a part time basis 
further below are discussions of savoy and our successful lease play in north dakota 
our largest contributor to revenue and earnings is the carlisle underground coal mine located in western indiana  about thirty miles south of terre haute 
the carlisle mine was in the development stage from april of through january of coal shipments began february  over of our coal sales are to customers with large scrubbed coal fired power plants in the state of indiana 
our mines and coal reserves are strategically located in close proximity to our primary customers  which reduces transportation costs and thus provides us with a competitive advantage with respect to those customers  our closest customer s plant is miles away and the farthest indiana customer is miles away 
we have access to our primary customers directly through either the csx corporation nyse csx or through the indiana rail road  majority owned by the csx 
these plants have made or announced plans to make significant investments in pollution control equipment 
due to these large investments none of these plants are scheduled for retirement  thus we expect to be supplying these plants for many years 
it is not economical for the smaller  older  less efficient power plants to install scrubbers and other pollution control devices  accordingly  those type plants most likely will be retired in the coming years 
headwinds and tailwinds affecting our company headwinds competition from low priced natgas the obama s administration dislike of burning coal to generate cheap and reliable electricity onerous environmental regulations and overzealous mislead environmentalists competition from new mines opening in the illinois basin mild weather slow economy tailwinds illinois basin ilb coal replacing central appalachia caap coal more power plants are installing scrubbers enabling them to burn high sulfur coal coal can compete with natgas down to mcf coal is fastest growing fuel worldwide  thus us exports are increasing rapidly for we will continue to focus on maintaining our low cost structure and leasing and permitting new reserves 
we see an increasing demand for coal produced in the ilb in the future 
demand for coal produced in the ilb is expected to grow at a rate faster than overall us coal demand  due to ilb coal having higher heating content than powder river basin prb and lower cost structure than caap coal 
many utilities are scrubbing to meet emission requirements beyond just sulfur compliance  even utilities that burn exclusively prb 
once scrubbed  those utilities are usually capable of burning ilb coal 
it is this trend of new scrubber installations coupled with rising caap cost structure that is leading to increased switching from caap coal to ilb coal 
some fuel switching will also occur from prb to ilb in newly scrubbed utilities located near ilb coal supply 
prospective information see page five of this report for a table that illustrates the status of our current coal contracts 
yorktown distributions as previously disclosed  yorktown energy partners and its affiliated partnerships yorktown have made six distributions to their numerous partners totaling million  per distribution shares since may in the past these distributions are made soon after we file our form qs and form k 
currently they own about million shares of our stock representing about of total shares outstanding 
we have been informed by yorktown that they have not made any determination as to the disposition of their remaining hallador stock 
while we do not know yorktown s ultimate strategy to realize the value of their hallador investment for their partners  we expect that over time such distributions will improve our liquidity and float 
if and when we are advised of another yorktown distribution we will timely report such on a form k 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations was million for this amount is less than last year due primarily to lower coal sales and payment of income taxes 
our capex budget for is million 
we expect to spend million at the carlisle mine  of which million is for airshafts  and million at the new ace in the hole surface mine 
the remainder is for other projects 
funding will come from cash from operations and draws from our new credit facility 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
special cash dividends during we paid three special dividends  april for 
per share  august for 
and december for 
for a total of 
per share 
during we paid one special dividend for 
and during we paid one special dividend for 
over the last three years we have paid out million in special dividends 
projects update see pages two three of this report for a discussion of our current projects 
msha reimbursements some of our coal contracts allow us to pass on certain costs incurred resulting from changes in costs to comply with mandates issued by msha or other government agencies 
in late december  we submitted an analysis of such costs which was reviewed by an outside consulting firm engaged by our customers 
in january the two customers agreed to reimburse us million for costs incurred by us during and during those years we were not able to accurately estimate what the ultimate outcome of these reimbursable costs would be so we did not record them until we were certain of the amounts and certain of collection 
such amounts were recorded during the first quarter of we submitted our incurred costs for in september of for million 
one of our customers agreed with our analysis and paid million in february and the other agreed with our analysis in may accordingly  million was recorded in the first quarter and the other million was recorded in the second quarter of we submitted our incurred costs for in october of for million 
we will not recognize any revenue until the customers have notified us that they accept the charges 
we were notified in february that one of the customers is substantially in agreement with our billings  we are still waiting to hear from the other customer 
the amount that was agreed upon by the first customer will be recorded in the first quarter of north dakota lease play we invested about million in a lease play located in slope  hettinger and stark counties of north dakota 
we sold the property during and recognized a gain of million 
we retained a working interest and an approximate average orri 
if and when a well is proposed  we expect to participate in the drilling 
results of operations quarterly coal sales and cost data in s st nd rd th year coal sales tons sold average price ton operating costs average cost ton margin margin ton capex      st nd rd th year coal sales tons sold average price ton operating costs average cost ton margin margin ton capex      for  we sold  tons at an average price of ton 
for we sold  tons at an average price of ton 
the warm winter and low natgas prices were the primary reasons our tons sold decreased 
our contracted tons for are million tons at an average price of 
operating costs and expenses averaged ton in compared to in the increase was due primarily to poor mining conditions that we experienced during several months of the year 
at times we also operated the mine on reduced hours due to lower customer demand  which has a negative effect on productivity which translates to higher costs 
as the mine expands our costs will increase as we have more area to maintain 
the mine s mains covered miles at december  compared to miles at december  capex in the fourth quarter of includes million for the purchase of the ace in the hole surface mine and another million for land at bull dog and carlisle 
capex in the fourth quarter of includes million for the purchase of land for the bull dog mine 
other analyses of results of operations the decrease in equity income from savoy was due to higher expenses in all categories plus a nonrecurring expense of million for stock based compensation 
further below is a table setting forth savoy s operations in more detail for the last two years 
the decrease in equity income from sunrise energy was due to lower natgas prices 
the increase in other income is due to higher msha reimbursements as more fully explained above under the heading msha reimbursements 
the increase in dd a was due to additions to plant and equipment 
the increase in coal exploration costs relates primarily to higher drilling expense associated with the bulldog mine and to new drilling associated with the russellville reserve 
sg a increased primarily due to higher expenses associated with the bulldog mine and the new russellville unassigned reserve and political contributions of  income taxes our effective tax rate was and we expect such rate to be in the range for we estimate that of such rate will be for taxes currently due 
ownership in savoy savoy operates almost exclusively in michigan 
they have an interest in the trenton black river play in southern michigan 
they hold  gross acres about  net in this area 
during savoy drilled gross wells in this play of which were dry and were successful 
during savoy plans on drilling or more additional wells in the play 
drilling locations in this play are identified based on the evaluation of extensive d seismic shoots 
savoy operates their own wells and their working interest averages between and and their net revenue interest averages between and 
savoy s net daily oil production currently averages barrels of oil 
savoy has an interest in about wells net

the reserve estimates are used in the dd a calculation  in our impairment test and in our internal cash flow projections 
if these estimates turn out to be materially under or over stated  our dd a expense and impairment test may be affected 
furthermore  if our coal reserves are materially overstated our liquidity and stock price could be adversely affected 
we have analyzed our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
we identified our federal tax return and our indiana state tax return as major tax jurisdictions 
the irs recently completed an examination of our and federal tax returns and there were no significant adjustments 
during the state of indiana completed their examination of our returns and no adjustments were proposed 
we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our consolidated financial position 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded 
our significant accounting policies are set forth in note to the financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements none of the recent fasb pronouncements will have any material effect on us 
political contributions during we donated  to the nma national mining association coal values program which is to help elect pro coal mining candidates and to promote the use of coal 
in april we made a  contribution to the super pac  restore our future rof and in september we made another  contribution to rof 
we expect such contributions to be minimal for in future elections  we encourage all of our shareholders and employees to support those candidates who unequivocally promote legislation and regulations that are favorable to the coal industry
