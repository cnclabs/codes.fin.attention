at january   we owned or had an interest in a portfolio of office properties located in nine states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
we offer fee based real estate services through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which in total managed and or leased approximately million square feet for third party property owners at january  unless otherwise indicated  all references to square feet represent net rentable area 
business objective and operating strategies our business objective is to maximize long term stockholder value by generating sustainable cash flow growth and increasing the long term value of our real estate assets through operations  acquisitions and capital recycling  while maintaining a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
we intend to achieve this objective by executing on the following business and growth strategies create value as the leading owner of quality assets in core submarkets 
our investment strategy is to pursue attractive returns by focusing primarily on owning high quality office buildings and portfolios that are well located and competitively positioned within central business district and urban infill locations within our core submarkets in the sunbelt region of the united states 
in these submarkets  we seek to maintain a portfolio that consists of core  core plus  and value add investment opportunities 
further  we intend to pursue an efficient capital allocation strategy that maximizes the returns on our invested capital 
this may include selectively disposing of properties when we believe returns have been maximized and redeploying capital into acquisitions or other opportunities 
maximize cash flow by continuing to enhance the operating performance of each property 
we provide property management and leasing services to our portfolio  actively managing our properties and leveraging our tenant relationships to improve operating performance  maximize long term cash flow and enhance stockholder value 
we seek to attain a favorable customer retention rate by providing outstanding property management and customer service programs responsive to the varying needs of our diverse temant base 
we also employ a judicious prioritization of capital projects to focus on projects that enhance the value of our property through increased rental rates  occupancy  service delivery  or enhanced reversion value 
realize leasing and operational efficiencies and gain local advantage 
we concentrate our real estate portfolio in submarkets where we believe that we can maximize market penetration by accumulating a critical mass of properties and thereby enhance operating efficiencies 
we believe that strengthening our local presence and leveraging our extensive market relationships will yield superior market information and service delivery and facilitate additional investment opportunities to create long term stockholder value 
occupancy 
our revenues are dependent on the occupancy of our office buildings 
at january   occupancy of our office portfolio was compared to at october  and at january  not included in the january  occupancy rate is the impact of signed leases totaling  square feet expected to take occupancy between now and the first quarter of  of which the majority will commence during the first quarter of including these signed leases  the our portfolio was leased at january  our average occupancy for the three months and year ended december  was and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  leases were renewed totaling  rentable square feet at an average annual rental rate per square foot of  representing a rate decrease as compared to expiring rental rates  and at an average cost of per square foot per year of the lease term 
during the year ended december   leases were renewed totaling  rentable square feet at an average annual rental rate per square foot of  representing a decrease as compared to expiring rental rates  and at an average cost of per square foot per year of the lease term 
during the fourth quarter of  we renewed a  square feet at hearst tower at an above market rental rate 
this renewal caused our average annual rental rate per square foot related to renewal leases to be higher than new and expansion leases signed during the year 
page of during the fourth quarter of  expansion leases were signed totaling  rentable square feet at an average annual rental rate per square foot of and at an average cost of per square foot per year of the lease term 
during the year ended december   expansion leases were signed totaling  rentable square feet at an average annual rental rate per square foot of and at an average cost of per square foot per year of the lease term 
during the fourth quarter of  new leases were signed totaling  rentable square feet at an average annual rental rate per square foot of and at an average cost of per square foot per year of the term 
during the year ended december   new leases were signed totaling  rentable square feet at an average annual rental rate per square foot of and at an average cost of per square foot per year of the lease term 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates in a market or at a specific property has the effect of reducing market rental rates 
inversely  a decrease in vacancy rates in a market or at a specific property has the effect of increasing market rental rates 
our leases typically have three to seven year terms  though the company does enter into leases with terms that are either shorter or longer than that typical range from time to time 
as leases expire  we seek to replace existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate 
for our properties owned as of january   management estimates that we have approximately per square foot in annual rental rate embedded loss in our office property leases 
embedded loss is defined as the difference between the weighted average in place cash rents including operating expense reimbursements and the weighted average estimated market rental rate 
customer retention 
keeping existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
we estimate that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the existing customer 
in making this estimate  we take into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which typically rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  we focus a great amount of energy on customer retention 
we seek to retain our customers by continually focusing on operations at our office properties 
we believe in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with customers and stockholders 
over the past ten years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
our customer retention rate was for the quarter ended december   as compared to for the quarter ended september   and for the quarter ended december  customer retention for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
joint ventures and partnerships management views investing in wholly owned properties as the highest priority of our capital allocation 
however  we may selectively pursue joint ventures if we determine that such a structure will allow us to reduce anticipated risks related to a property or portfolio or to address unusual operational risks

the primary reason for the decrease in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in the amount of million is primarily attributable to parkway proportionate share of impairment losses recorded during on fund i office properties  net operating income recorded in from fund ii purchases which closed in the second quarter of and first quarter of and the purchase of six wholly owned office properties during  gains on sale of real estate from discontinued operations  and acquisition costs recognized in  offset by non cash impairment losses on real estate  management contracts and goodwill recorded during the change in loss from discontinued operations as well as other variances for income and expense items that comprise net loss attributable to common stockholders is discussed in detail below 
office properties 
the analysis below includes changes attributable to same store properties and acquisitions of office properties 
same store properties are consolidated properties that we owned for the current and prior year reporting periods  excluding properties classified as discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we classified as discontinued operations properties totaling million square feet  which were sold during at december   same store properties consisted of properties comprising million square feet

depreciation and amortization expense attributable to office properties increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period for the primary reason for the increase is due to the purchase of eight office properties and an additional interest in one property during  which were owned for a full year during  in addition to nine office properties purchased during the total gross purchase price for acquisitions completed during the year ended december  was million compared with million for the same period of impairment loss on real estate

impairment loss on management contracts and goodwill 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash impairment loss  net of deferred tax liability  associated with our investment in management contracts and goodwill 
our strategy related to the third party management business has changed since the acquisition of these contracts 
when the contracts were acquired  our strategy was to grow the third party business and continue to add management contracts in our various markets 
while we still view the cash flows from this business as positive and the additional management contracts gives us scale and critical mass in some of our key markets  we are no longer actively seeking to grow this portion of the business 
given this change in strategy  we determined that our management contracts and associated goodwill were impaired and recorded a million non cash impairment charge  net of deferred tax liability  during the fourth quarter of impairment loss on mortgage loan receivable 
during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment loss on a mortgage loan of million in connection with the b participation piece of a first mortgage secured by an  square foot office property in dallas  texas known as ross 
the borrower is in default on the first mortgage and we did not believe we would recover our investment in the loan 
therefore  we wrote off our total investment in the mortgage loan 
our original cash investment in the loan was million and was purchased in november change in fair value of contingent consideration 
on may   we closed on the agreement with eola in which eola contributed its property management company to us 
eola principals contributed the management company to us for initial consideration of million in cash and contingent consideration of million common units to eola principals through an earn out and earn up arrangement based on the achievement by the management company of certain targeted annual gross fee revenue for the balance of and the initial value of the common units was million based on our stock price on the date of purchase 
however  due to the decline in our stock price during  the value of the contingent consideration was reduced to million  resulting in a change in fair value of the contingent consideration of million recorded during the year ended december   as compared to an increase of  recorded during the year ended december   upon the issuance of the common units 
on december   we and the former eola principals amended certain post closing provisions of the contribution agreement to provide  among other things  that if the management company achieved annual revenues in excess of the original target  all common units subject to the earn out  the earn out and the earn up will be deemed earned and paid when the earn out payment is made 
based on the management company revenue for  the target was achieved and all common units were earned and issued to eola principals on february  as of december   all common units had been redeemed for our common stock 
page of management company income and expenses 
management company income increased million and management company expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared to the same period for and is primarily a result of a full year of activity for the eola management company which was purchased in the second quarter of acquisition costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in acquisition costs compared to million for the same period in the primary reason for the decrease is due to costs associated with the eola combination and purchase of eight fund ii office properties that closed during the first half of  compared with the purchase of three fund ii office properties and a parking garage and six wholly owned office properties that closed during our proportionate share of acquisition costs for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased million or for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the decrease is primarily due to additional personnel expenses incurred during as part of our realignment efforts 
share based and long term compensation expense 
compensation expense related to restricted shares and deferred incentive share units of  and million was recognized for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was million at december  the weighted average period over which the expense is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
during the year ended december   compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized and the weighted average period over which expense is expected to be recognized decreased as a result of approximately  awards either vesting or being forfeited 
on february   the board of directors approved  long term equity incentive awards to our officers

dividends in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to the sum of of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus the sum of certain items of noncash income over of our reit taxable income 
we have made and intend to continue to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements 
it is possible  however  that we  from time to time  may not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and the inclusion of such income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our taxable income  or if the amount of nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or capital expenditures exceeds the amount of noncash deductions 
in the event that such timing differences occur  in order to meet the distribution requirements  we may arrange for short term  or possibly long term  borrowing to permit the payment of required dividends 
if the amount of nondeductible expenses exceeds noncash deductions  we may refinance our indebtedness to reduce principal payments and may borrow funds for capital expenditures

our investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  we are generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or customers for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc  our majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest 
we also consolidate subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we consider critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following revenue recognition  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  and initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
revenue recognition 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
the cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as straight line rent receivable on the accompanying balance sheets 
when we are the owner of the tenant improvements  the leased space is ready for its intended use when the tenant improvements are substantially completed 
in limited instances  when the customer is the owner of the tenant improvements  straight line rent is recognized when the tenant takes possession of the unimproved space 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
property operating cost recoveries from customers expense reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
the computation of expense reimbursements is dependent on the provisions of individual customer leases 
most customers make monthly fixed payments of estimated expense reimbursements 
we make adjustments  positive or negative  to expense reimbursement income quarterly to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final property operating costs based on the most recent quarterly budget 
after the end of the calendar year  we compute each customer final expense reimbursements and issues a bill or credit for the difference between the actual amount and the amounts billed monthly during the year 
management company income represents market based fees earned from providing management  construction  leasing  brokerage and acquisition services to third parties 
management fee income is computed and recorded monthly in accordance with the terms set forth in the standalone management service agreements 
leasing and brokerage commissions are recognized pursuant to the terms of the standalone agreements at the time underlying leases are signed  which is the point at which the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
fees relating to the purchase or sale of property are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured  which usually occurs at closing 
all fees on company owned properties and consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation 
the portion of fees earned on unconsolidated joint ventures attributable to our ownership interest is eliminated in consolidation 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of customers for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets and intangible assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
page of we classify certain assets as held for sale based on management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions to close in the next twelve months 
we consider an office property as held for sale once we have executed a contract for sale  allowed the buyer to complete its due diligence review and received a substantial non refundable deposit 
until a buyer has completed its due diligence review of the asset  necessary approvals have been received and substantive conditions to the buyer obligation to perform have been satisfied  we do not consider a sale to be probable 
when we identify an asset as held for sale  we estimate the net realizable value of such asset and discontinue recording depreciation on the asset 
we record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
the cash flow and fair value estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  we would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease to net income 
depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in a decrease or increase in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
we account for our acquisitions of real estate by allocating the fair value of real estate to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  which consist of the value of above and below market losses  lease costs  the value of in place leases  customer relationships and any value attributable to above or below market debt assumed with the acquisition 
we allocate the purchase price of properties to tangible and intangible assets based on fair values 
we determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which change the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value  changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the fasb does not intend for asu to result in a change in the application of the requirements in asc the requirements of asu are effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  at march   we had implemented asu in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income  which modifies reporting requirements for comprehensive income in order to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
asu requires presentation of either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements in which the first statement presents net income and its components followed by a second statement that presents total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and total comprehensive income 
the requirements of asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  at march   we had implemented asu page of funds from operations ffo management believes that ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the nareit definition of ffo including any guidance that nareit releases with respect to the definition 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with gaap  reduced by preferred dividends  excluding gains or losses from sale of previously depreciable real estate assets  impairment charges related to depreciable real estate and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to derive our pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures 
further  we do not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges 
we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
however  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization  among other items  from net income  as defined by gaap 
we believe that the use of ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful 
ffo as reported by us may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our net loss to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net loss for parkway properties  inc adjustments to derive ffo depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations noncontrolling interest depreciation and amortization noncontrolling interest unit holders adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures convertible preferred dividends preferred dividends gain on sale of real estate parkway share impairment loss on depreciable real estate parkway share ffo attributable to common stockholders funds from operations attributable to common stockholders for the years ended december  and include our proportionate share of the following items in thousands year ended december gain loss on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs expenses related to litigation lease termination fee income change in fair value of contingent consideration non cash charge for interest rate swap realignment expenses personnel loss on non depreciable assets ebitda we believe that using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure helps investors and our management analyze our ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
however  the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities are that ebitda does not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures or the cash required to make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt 
although ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  we compensate for the limitations by only using ebitda to supplement gaap financial measures 
additionally  we believe that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required gaap measures of our performance and liquidity to improve their understanding of our operating results and liquidity 
page of we view ebitda primarily as a liquidity measure and  as such  the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is cash flows provided by operating activities 
because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  or cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap

ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
annualized ebitda includes the implied annualized impact of any acquisition or disposition activity during the period 
page of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on us because of the relatively low inflation rate in our geographic areas of operation 
additionally  most of the leases require the customers to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
our leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable us to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate
