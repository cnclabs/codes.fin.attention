our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview astrotech corporation nasdaq astc astrotech  the company  we  us or our  a washington corporation  is a commercial aerospace company that was formed in to leverage the environment of space for commercial purposes 
for nearly years  the company has remained a crucial player in space commerce activities 
we have supported the launch of shuttle missions and more than spacecraft 
we ve designed and built space hardware and processing facilities and constructed world class processing facilities 
we currently own  operate and maintain world class spacecraft processing facilities  prepare and process scientific research from microgravity and develop and manufacture sophisticated chemical sensor equipment 
our efforts are focused on providing world class facilities and related support services necessary for the preparation of satellites and payloads 
providing satellite and payload processing and integration service and support 
designing  fabricating and utilizing equipment and hardware for launch activities 
supplying propellant and associated services for spacecraft 
managing launch logistics and support 
working with development partners to build industry specific applications using our sensor equipment 
commercializing unique space based technologies 
our business units astrotech space operations aso aso provides support to its government and commercial customers as they successfully process complex communication  earth observation and deep space satellites in preparation for their launch on a variety of launch vehicles 
processing activities include satellite ground transportation  pre launch hardware integration and testing  satellite encapsulation  fueling  launch pad delivery  and communication linked launch control 
our aso facilities can accommodate five meter class satellites  encompassing the majority of us based satellites 
aso s service capabilities include designing and building spacecraft processing equipment and facilities 
additionally  aso provides propellant services including designing  building and testing propellant service equipment for servicing spacecraft 
aso accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended june  revenue for our aso business unit is generated primarily from various fixed priced contracts with launch service providers in both the government and commercial markets and the design and fabrication of space launch equipment 
the services and facilities we provide to our customers support the final assembly  checkout  and countdown functions associated with preparing and launching spacecraft 
the revenue and cash flows generated from our aso operations are primarily related to the number of spacecraft launches and the fabrication of the gse for the us government 
other factors that have impacted  and are expected to continue to impact  earnings and cash flows for this business include the continuing limited availability of competing facilities at the major domestic launch sites that can offer comparable services  leading to an increase in government and commercial use of our services 
our ability to design and fabricate spacecraft preparation and processing equipment 
our ability to control our capital expenditures  which are primarily limited to modifications required to accommodate payload processing for new launch vehicles and upgrading building infrastructure 
our ability to complete customer specified facility modifications within budgeted costs and time commitments 
uncertainty in government funding and support for key space programs 
the impact of competition and industry consolidation and our ability to win new contracts 
spacetech our other business unit is a technology incubator designed to commercialize space industry technologies 
this business unit is currently pursuing two distinct opportunities st detect st detect develops  manufactures and sells ultra small mass spectrometers and related equipment 
mass spectrometers  in general  measure the mass and relative abundance of ions in a sample to create a mass spectrum 
this resulting mass spectrum is a unique fingerprint for each chemical that can be compared to a reference library of mass spectra to verify the identity of a sample 
mass spectrometers can identify chemicals with more accuracy and precision than competing instruments given their extreme sensitivity and specificity and they are a staple of almost all analytical laboratories 
by leveraging technology initiated by an engagement with nasa to develop a mass spectrometer for the iss  the company has developed a series of instruments that are significantly smaller  lighter  faster and less expensive than competing mass spectrometers  and significantly more sensitive and accurate than other competing chemical detectors 
our efforts have resulted in a technology that can provide mass spectrometry performance in real time or in the field 
the mms tm is a small  low power mass spectrometer designed initially for the laboratory market 
the unique design of this unit enables mass spectrometric quality chemical analysis in a small package about the size of a shoebox that operates off less power than a typical light bulb 
this allows high quality chemical analysis to be performed in locations where mass spectrometers have not been used before  such as directly on the factory floor or in the battlefield  without compromising the quality of the analysis 
the oem s a mass spectrometer component that was developed for applications where customers need the high quality analysis provided by a mass spectrometer but in a platform that can be integrated into customer specific packages 
the oem uses the same high performance analyzer as the mms tm but is provided as an open platform for customers and development partners to integrate with their complementary technologies  with application specific sample preparation  inlets and software 
astrogenetix astrogenetix is a biotechnology company formed to commercialize products processed in the unique environment of microgravity 
astrogenetix pursued an aggressive space access strategy to take advantage of the space shuttle program prior to its retirement in this strategy gave astrogenetix unprecedented access to research in microgravity  as the company flew experiments twelve times over a three year period 
astrogenetix and the team are currently researching a salmonella vaccine as part of its ongoing commercialization strategy 
concurrently  the team is evaluating a vaccine target for mrsa based on discoveries made in microgravity 
in december  the company negotiated a space act agreement with nasa for a minimum of twenty eight additional space flights 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition astrotech recognizes revenue employing several generally accepted revenue recognition methodologies across its business units 
the methodology used is based on contract type and the manner in which products and services are provided 
revenue generated by astrotech s payload processing facilities is recognized ratably over the occupancy period of the satellite while in the astrotech facilities 
the percentage of completion method is used for all contracts where incurred costs can be reasonably estimated and successful completion can be reasonably assured at inception 
changes in estimated costs to complete and provisions for contract losses are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue for the sale of commercial products is recognized at shipment 
a summary of revenue recognition methods services products provided contract type method of revenue recognition payload processing facilities firm fixed price mission specific ratably  over the occupancy period of a satellite within the facility from arrival through launch construction contracts firm fixed price percentage of completion based on costs incurred engineering services cost reimbursable award fixed fee reimbursable costs incurred plus award fixed fee commercial products specific purchase order based at shipment grant cost reimbursable award as costs are incurred for related research and development expenses under certain contracts  we make expenditures for specific enhancements and or additions to our facilities where the customer agrees to pay a fixed fee to deliver the enhancement or addition 
we account for such agreements as a reduction in the cost of such investments and recognize any excess of amounts collected above the expenditure as revenue 
long lived asset in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  fixed assets  assets under construction and intangible assets  we evaluate the recoverability of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents amounts collected from customers for projects  products  or services expected to be provided at a future date 
deferred revenue is shown on the balance sheet as either a short term or long term liability  depending on when the service or product is expected to be provided 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based awards to employees based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the fair value of the stock options is estimated using expected dividend yields of the company s stock  the expected volatility of the stock  the expected length of time the options remain outstanding and risk free interest rates 
changes in one or more of these factors may significantly affect the estimated fair value of the stock options 
additionally  the company estimates the number of instruments for which the required service is expected to be rendered 
the company estimates forfeitures using historical forfeiture rates for previous grants of equity instruments 
the fair value of awards that are expected to vest is recorded as an expense over the vesting period 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest accounting is applied for any entities where the company maintains more than and less than ownership 
the company clearly identifies the noncontrolling interest in the balance sheets and income statements 
we also disclose three measures of net income loss net income loss  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  and net income loss attributable to astrotech corporation 
our operating cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows reflect net income loss  while our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect net income loss attributable to astrotech corporation 
state of texas funding the company accounts for the state of texas funding in the amount of million in its majority owned subsidiary st detect as a contribution of capital and has reflected the disbursement in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
while the award agreement includes both a common stock purchase right and a note payable to the state of texas  the economic substance of the transaction is that the state of texas has purchased shares of st detect in exchange for the granted award 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   the company has established a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets 
fasb asc  income taxes fasb asc addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the company has an unrecognized tax benefit of million for the years ended june  and for the year ended june  and  the company s effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to recording changes to the valuation allowance placed against its net deferred tax assets 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and in various states 
due to the company s loss carryover position  it is subject to us federal and state income tax examination adjustments to its carryover benefits generated after currently  the company is under examination by the internal revenue service for its through tax year

other long term liabilities 
other long term liabilities increased million for the year ended june   as compared to june  this was due to an increase in non current deferred revenue and a tenant reimbursement st detect received upon entering a new building lease 
liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of the change in our cash and cash equivalents june  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at june   we held cash and cash equivalents of million and our working capital was approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents have decreased by approximately million during the year ended june  at june   we held cash and cash equivalents of million and our working capital was approximately million 
operating activities net cash used in operations was million for the year ended june  compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended june  the decrease in cash flow provided by operations was primarily due to a reduction in deferred revenue cash collections on customer contracts  which was attributable to the gse project 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the year ended june  our investing activities are driven primarily by the timing of capital expenditures for our payload processing facilities 
in fiscal year  this increase was the result of capital expenditures for our st detect facilities to support future growth and ensure sufficient capacity to meet forecasted demand for our ultra small mass spectrometer product line 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended june  in the year ended june   st detect received the second installment of million from the texas emerging technology fund  which was used to fund the continued development of the st detect ultra small mass spectrometer and related equipment 
debt credit facilities in october  we entered into a financing facility with a commercial bank providing a million term loan note and a million revolving credit facility 
the million term loan terminates in october  and the million revolving credit facility expired in october the company had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
the term loan requires monthly payments of principal plus interest at the rate of prime plus  but not less than 
the bank financing facilities are secured by the assets of aso  including accounts receivable  and require us to comply with designated covenants 
the balance of the million term loan at june  was million 
the bank financing facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply 
as of june   we were in compliance with the debt covenants 
liquidity at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and our working capital was approximately million 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology  costs associated with increasing our manufacturing and development facilities  costs associated with strategic acquisitions including integration costs and assumed liabilities  litigation expense  the status of competitive products and potential cost associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property 
additionally  actions taken as a result of the ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital equipment requirements and other expected liquidity requirements for the coming year 
factors that could affect our capital requirements  in addition to those listed above include continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience  uncertainty surrounding mission launch schedules  and our ability to manage product development efforts 
debt covenant compliance the company s debt repayments are due as follows in thousands balance fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year term note our bank financing facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply  including the maintenance by us of a debt service coverage ratio of not less than to  maintaining a tangible net worth of not less than million  and a maintaining a leverage ratio of not greater than 
to 
these financial covenants are applicable to the results of aso 
in the event we are not in compliance with a covenant  the bank may  among other things  accelerate all outstanding borrowings  cease extending credit or foreclose on collateral 
during fiscal year  we were not in compliance with our debt service coverage ratio and we obtained a waiver from the bank that indefinitely waived this event of default with respect to the periods we were in non compliance 
as of june   we were in compliance with our affirmative and negative debt covenants 
however  our financial projections for fiscal year indicated that we will likely not be in compliance with our debt service coverage ratio and minimum tangible net worth covenants by the third quarter ended march  on october   we amended the debt agreement with our bank that updated the following with respect to our debt covenants provided a credit of million and million for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year  respectively  to our debt service coverage calculation  reduced our minimum tangible net worth requirement to million for the third and fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year  and required that we maintain a minimum cash balance at the bank of million through june  and million thereafter 
under the terms of the amendment  we expect to be compliant with our affirmative and negative covenants through june  therefore  we have classified our debt as noncurrent for any principal payments due after june  we believe we have sufficient liquidity and backlog to fund ongoing operations for at least the next fiscal year 
we expect to utilize existing cash and proceeds from operations to grow our core business offering in aso and to support strategies for spacetech 
nasdaq notice on november   we received written notification from nasdaq indicating that the minimum bid price of our common stock had fallen below for consecutive trading days and that we were therefore not in compliance with nasdaq listing rule a 
on may   we received a second compliance notice from nasdaq regarding the company failure to maintain the minimum bid price for continued listing 
however  the nasdaq staff has determined that the company is eligible for an additional day grace period  or until november   to regain compliance 
nasdaq determination was based on the company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the nasdaq capital market  with the exception of the bid price requirement  and the company written notice to nasdaq of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split  if necessary 
contractual obligations in addition to the term loan see debt explanation above  the company is obligated under non cancelable operating leases for equipment  office space and the land for a payload processing facility 
future minimum payments under the term loan and non cancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years term loan operating lease obligations total rent expense was approximately million for the year ended june  and approximately million for the year ended june  the company received sublease payments of million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  aso presently leases the acre site located on vafb in california  where we own four buildings totaling over  square feet of space 
the company has extended the original land lease  which expired in september the new lease expires in september  with provisions to extend the lease at the request of the lessee and the concurrence of the lessor 
state of texas funding in march  the texas emerging technology fund awarded st detect million for the development and marketing of the miniature chemical detector  a portable mass spectrometer designed to serve the industrial  environmental  security and healthcare markets see note 
as of june   st detect had received both of the two million disbursements 
the disbursed amount represents a contingency through march  the date of cancellation 
if an event of default should occur  the company would calculate and expense accrued interest and reclassify principal from equity to notes payable in the consolidated financial statements as amounts due to the state of texas 
management considers the likelihood of an event of default to be remote due to the fact that the covenants that would necessitate repayment are within the control of the company 
as of june   no default events have occurred 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk relates to interest rates 
we do not currently use any interest rate swaps or derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
a one percent change in variable interest rates will not have a material impact on our financial condition
