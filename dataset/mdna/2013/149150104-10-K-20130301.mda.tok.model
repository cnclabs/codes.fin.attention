under the bank s current policy  a loan will generally be placed on a non accrual status if interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against current income  and subsequent payments received are generally first applied towards the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received or the loan is well collateralized  and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled

competition we face substantial competition for deposits  loans and other banking services  as well as acquisitions  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
these banks and financial institutions have greater resources than we do  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand and make acquisitions 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  they have substantially greater lending limits than we do and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies have increased the level of competition among financial services companies and may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services 
significant increases in the costs of monitoring and ensuring compliance with new banking regulations and the necessary costs of upgrading information technology and data processing capabilities can have a disproportionate impact on our ability to compete with larger institutions 
to compete with other financial institutions in its primary service areas  the bank relies principally upon local promotional activities  personal contacts by its officers  directors  employees  and stockholders  extended hours on weekdays  saturday banking in certain locations  internet banking  an internet website www

this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund  and secondarily for the stability of the us banking system 
it is not intended for the benefit of stockholders of financial institutions 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations 
this discussion is also qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text and to the implementation and enforcement of the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion 
additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before congress  the california legislature  and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation  and competitive relationship among financial institutions and may subject us to increased supervision and disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various bank regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations and policies to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulatory changes in policy may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the bank would be affected thereby 
in addition  the outcome of examinations  any litigation  or any investigations initiated by state or federal authorities may result in necessary changes in our operations and increased compliance costs 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act financial reform legislation the dodd frank act significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement authority of the federal bank regulatory agencies 
the numerous rules and regulations that have been promulgated and are yet to be promulgated and finalized under the dodd frank act are likely to significantly impact our operations and compliance costs 
the dodd frank act followed the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa and the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra in response to the economic downturn and financial industry instability 
the dodd frank act impacts many aspects of the financial industry and  in many cases  will impact larger and smaller financial institutions and community banks differently over time 
many of the following key provisions of the dodd frank act affecting the financial industry are now either effective or are in the proposed rule or implementation stage the creation of a financial services oversight counsel to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation  expanded the authority of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain systemically significant non bank financial companies in addition to depository institutions  the establishment of strengthened capital and liquidity requirements for banks and bank holding companies  including minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements no less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment  the requirement by statute that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries  limitations  or significant burdens and compliance and other costs  on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations  such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets  arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions and proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds the volcker rule  the termination of investments by the us treasury under the troubled asset relief program tarp  the elimination and phase out of trust preferred securities from tier capital with certain exceptions  a permanent increase of fdic deposit insurance to  and an extension of federal deposit coverage through for the full net amount held by depositors in business checking and othernon interesting bearing transaction accounts  changes in the calculation of fdic deposit insurance assessments  such that the assessment base will no longer be the institution s deposit base  but instead  will be its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity  the elimination of remaining barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks  expanded restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under section a and b of the federal reserve act and lending limits for derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  and securities lending and borrowing transactions  provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at most united states publicly traded companies  including i stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation  ii executive compensation clawback requirements for companies listed on national securities exchanges in the event of materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria  iii enhanced independence requirements for compensation committee members  and iv giving the sec authority to adopt proxy access rules which would permit stockholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as director and have those nominees included in a company s proxy statement  and the establishment of the consumer finance protection bureau cfpb with responsibility for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers financial interests and prohibit unfair  deceptive  and abusive acts and practices by financial institutions  and with authority to directly examine those financial institutions with billion or more in assets for compliance with consumer laws and regulations 
in general  more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage requirements are expected to impact our business as the dodd frank act is fully implemented 
the federal agencies have issued proposed rules which will apply directly to larger institutions with more than billion in assets  such as regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve for financial institutions deemed systemically significant  federal reserve and fdic rules requiring stress tests and federal reserve rules to implement the volcker rule 
however  requirements and policies imposed on larger institutions may  in some cases  become best practice standards for smaller institutions 
therefore  as a result of the changes required by the dodd frank act  the profitability of our business activities may be impacted and we may be required to make changes to certain of our business practices 
these changes may also require us to devote significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 
we participated in tarp  which was designed to bolster eligible healthy institutions by injecting capital into these institutions  so that we could continue to lend and support our current and prospective clients 
under the terms of our participation  we received million in exchange for the issuance of preferred stock the series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock and thereby became subject to various requirements  including certain restrictions on paying dividends on our common stock and repurchasing our equity securities  unless the us treasury has consented 
in order to participate in tarp  financial institutions were required to adopt certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
arra also included a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
arra imposes certain stringent executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all tarp recipients until the us treasury is repaid 
we have complied with the compensation provisions of tarp and arra and have certified as to such compliance in the exhibits attached to this report pursuant to section b of eesa 
we contemplate that we may be able to partially or fully redeem the series b preferred stock in depending on our earnings and receipt of approval by our regulators to receive dividends from the bank that would be used to repurchase our series b preferred stock

they are not intended for the benefit of stockholders of financial institutions 
the following discussion of key statutes and regulations to which the bancorp and the bank are subject is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full statutes and regulations 
the wide range of requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state banking laws include requirements that bank holding companies and banks file periodic reports 
requirements that bank holding companies and banks meet or exceed minimum capital requirements 
see part item business capital requirements 
requirements that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for their banking subsidiaries 
in addition  the regulatory agencies have prompt corrective action authority to limit activities and require a limited guaranty of a required bank capital restoration plan by a bank holding company if the capital of a bank subsidiary falls below capital levels required by the regulators 
limitations on dividends payable to stockholders 
the bancorp s ability to pay dividends on both its common and preferred stock are subject to legal and regulatory restrictions 
a substantial portion of the bancorp s funds to pay dividends or to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations is derived from dividends paid by the bank 
limitations on dividends payable by bank subsidiaries 
these dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depositary institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
moreover  the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings 
safety and soundness requirements 
banks must be operated in a safe and sound manner and meet standards applicable to internal controls  information systems  internal audit  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  and compensation  as well as other operational and management standards 
these safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in exercising their supervisory authority and their authority to initiate informal or formal enforcement action 
requirements for notice  application and approval  or non objection of acquisitions and activities conducted directly or in subsidiaries of the bancorp or the bank 
compliance with the community reinvestment act cra 
the cra requires that banks help meet the credit needs in their communities  including the availability of credit to low and moderate income individuals 
if the bank fails to adequately serve its communities  penalties may be imposed  including denials of applications for branches  for adding subsidiaries and affiliates  or for the merger with or purchase of other financial institutions 
in its last reported examination by the fdic in march   the bank received a cra rating of satisfactory 
compliance with the bank secrecy act  the usa patriot act  and other anti money laundering laws 
these laws and regulations require financial institutions to assist us government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies  procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering  terrorist financing  and other suspicious activity 
limitations on the amount of loans to one borrower and its affiliates and to executive officers and directors 
limitations on transactions with affiliates 
restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments in  and ability to underwrite  certain securities 
requirements for opening of intra and interstate branches 
truth in lending and other consumer protection and disclosure laws to ensure equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions 
provisions of the gramm leach bliley act of glb act and other federal and state laws dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of customers 
additional restrictions on bancorp and bank activities subject to prior notice or federal reserve approval  bank holding companies may generally engage in  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities determined by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
bank holding companies which elect and retain financial holding company status pursuant to the glb act may engage in these nonbanking activities and broader securities  insurance  merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be financial in nature or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior federal reserve approval 
pursuant to the glb act and the dodd frank act  in order to elect and retain financial holding company status  a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed  and  except in limited circumstances  depository subsidiaries must be in satisfactory compliance with the cra  which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate 
failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non compliance within a fixed time period could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks or require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company 
the bancorp has not elected financial holding company status and has not engaged in any activities determined by the federal reserve to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature 
pursuant to the federal deposit insurance act fdi act and the california financial code  california state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks 
therefore  the bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so called closely related to banking or nonbanking activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries or subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
further  pursuant to the glb act  california banks may conduct certain financial activities in a subsidiary to the same extent as may a national bank  provided the bank is and remains well capitalized  well managed and in satisfactory compliance with the cra 
the bank currently has no financial subsidiaries 
enforcement authority the bank operates branches and or loan production offices in california  new york  illinois  massachusetts  texas  washington  and new jersey 
while the dfi remains the bank s primary state regulator  the bank s operations in these jurisdictions are subject to examination and supervision by local bank regulators  and transactions with customers in those jurisdictions are subject to local laws  including consumer protection laws 
the bank also operates a branch in hong kong and a representative office in taipei and in shanghai 
the operations of these foreign offices and branches and limits on the scope of their activities are subject to local law and regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions in addition to regulation and supervision by the dfi and the federal reserve 
the federal and california regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
the regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institution s capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to i internal controls  information systems  and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv interest rate exposure  v asset growth and asset quality  and vi compensation  fees  and benefits 
further  the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
if  as a result of an examination  the dfi or the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  the dfi and the fdic  and separately the fdic as insurer of the bank s deposits  have residual authority to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios  which may preclude the bank from being deemed well capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits  restrict the bank s growth geographically  by products and services  or by mergers and acquisitions  enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions  including required board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices  require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes  remove officers and directors  and assess civil monetary penalties  and terminate fdic insurance  revoke the bank s charter  take possession of and close and liquidate the bank  or appoint the fdic as receiver 
the federal reserve has similar enforcement authority over bank holding companies and commonly takes parallel action in conjunction with actions taken by a subsidiary bank s regulators 
on december   the bancorp entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of san francisco the frb sf under which the bancorp agreed  among other things  to limitations on payment of and receipt of dividends and on senior executive officer and director changes  and to submit a plan to maintain sufficient capital  a plan to improve management of our liquidity position and funds management practices  and a liquidity policy and contingency funding plan for the bancorp 
until it was terminated as of november   the bank was subject to a memorandum of understanding with the dfi and the fdic that was entered into on march   by which the bank agreed to undertake certain steps to strengthen its operations 
this included  among other things  the submission of satisfactory plans to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to enhance and to improve the quality of our stress testing of the bank s loan portfolio  to address improved profitability and capital ratios and reduce the bank s overall risk profile  to improve asset quality  and to reduce dependence on wholesale funding 
in addition  we were required to maintain management and a board acceptable to the dfi and fdic 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries 
the fdic insures our customer deposits through the deposit insurance fund the dif up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the maximum deposit insurance amount was permanently increased to  and unlimited insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts was provided through december   but the latter coverage was not extended by congress 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors 
all fdic insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the dif 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in we are generally unable to control the amount of assessments that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the fdic otherwise determines  we may be required to pay even higher fdic assessments than the recently increased levels 
these increases in fdic insurance assessments may have a material and adverse affect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of  or market for  our common stock 
capital adequacy requirements bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies 
increased capital requirements have also been proposed as a result of expanded authority set forth in the dodd frank act 
capital adequacy guidelines and  additionally for banks  prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting  and other factors 
at december   the company s and the bank s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy guideline percentage requirements of the federal banking agencies for well capitalized institutions 
see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources capital adequacy 
the current risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks adopted by the federal banking agencies are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  such as loans  and those recorded as off balance sheet items  such as commitments  letters of credit  and recourse arrangements 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk based capital standards 
qualifying capital is classified depending on the type of capital tier i capital currently includes common equity and trust preferred securities  subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits 
the capital received from the sale of the series b preferred stock also qualifies as tier i capital 
under the dodd frank act  depository institution holding companies with more than billion in total consolidated assets as of december   will no longer be able to include trust preferred securities as tier regulatory capital as of the end of a phase out period in  and will be obligated to replace any outstanding trust preferred securities issued prior to may   with qualifying tier regulatory capital during the phase out period 
tier ii capital includes hybrid capital instruments  other qualifying debt instruments  a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
following the phase out period under the dodd frank act  trust preferred securities will be treated as tier ii capital 
tier iii capital consists of qualifying unsecured debt 
the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 
under the current capital guidelines  there are three fundamental capital ratios a total risk based capital ratio  a tier risk based capital ratio  and a tier leverage ratio 
to be deemed well capitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least at  and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
there is currently no tier leverage requirement for a holding company to be deemed well capitalized 
at december   the respective capital ratios of the bancorp and the bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed well capitalized 
as of december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
as of december   the bancorp s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
the bancorp and the bank are also required to maintain a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  and the bancorp s leverage capital ratio was  both of which exceeded regulatory minimums 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans 
federal regulators may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant and have required many banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized  in which case institutions may no longer be deemed well capitalized and may therefore be subject to restrictions on taking brokered deposits 
the federal regulatory authorities risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord basel i of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee 
the basel committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
in  the basel committee published a new capital accord basel ii to replace basel i 
basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk an internal ratings based approach tailored to individual institutions circumstances and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing risk based capital guidelines 
basel ii also sets capital requirements for operational risk and refines the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures 
in december  the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation  now officially identified as basel iii 
if and when implemented by the us banking agencies and fully phased in  it would require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than currently required  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
the dodd frank act also required the federal reserve  the office of the controller of the currency  and the fdic to adopt regulations imposing a continuing floor of the basel i based capital requirements in cases where the basel ii based capital requirements and any changes in capital regulations resulting from basel iii otherwise would permit lower requirements 
in december  the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking not yet finalized that would implement this requirement 
on june   the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules that would revise their risk based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the basel committee in basel iii and certain provisions of the dodd frank act 
the proposed rules  which would be fully phased in by january   would apply to all depository institutions  top tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more  and top tier savings and loan holding companies banking organizations 
among other things  the proposed rules establish a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement of and a higher minimum tier capital requirement of and assign higher risk weightings to exposures that are more than days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition  development or construction of real property 
additionally  the us implementation of basel iii contemplates that  for banking organizations with less than billion in assets  the ability to treat trust preferred securities as tier capital would be phased out over a ten year period 
the proposed rules also require unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements 
the proposed rules limit a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of of a specified amount of common equity tier capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements 
the proposed rules indicated that the final rule would become effective on january   and the changes set forth in the final rules will be phased in from january   through january  however  the agencies have recently indicated that  due to the volume of public comments received  the final rule would not become effective on january  while the proposed regulatory capital requirements  when finalized  will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards for the bancorp and the bank  it is difficult at this time to predict when or how many of the proposed provisions will ultimately be adopted or whether broader exemptions may be provided for community banks 
in addition  bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain yet additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements 
the implementation of more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the bancorp s net income and return on equity  restrict the ability to pay dividends and require the raising of additional capital 
failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies  including issuance of a capital directive  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits  limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business 
significant additional restrictions can be imposed on fdic insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements under the regulatory agencies prompt corrective action authority 
prompt corrective action provisions the fdi act provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates  including parent holding companies  by their federal banking regulators 
it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards  including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan 
supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the prompt corrective action rules generally depend upon an institution s classification within five capital categories as defined in the regulations 
the relevant capital measures are the capital ratio  the tier capital ratio  and the leverage ratio 
however  the federal banking agencies have also adopted non capital safety and soundness standards to assist examiners in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
these include operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems  and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset quality and growth  v earnings  vi risk management  and vii compensation and benefits 
a depository institution s capital tier under the prompt corrective action regulations will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and the other factors established by the regulations 
a bank will be i well capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  ii adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not well capitalized  iii undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  iv significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  and v critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal to or less than of average quarterly tangible assets 
an institution may be downgraded to  or deemed to be in  a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters 
the fdi act generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the regulatory agencies may not accept such a plan without determining that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the plan 
the bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance with potential liability of up to of the depository institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized 
dividends holders of the bancorp s common stock and preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore under the laws of the state of delaware 
delaware corporations such as the bancorp may make distributions to their stockholders out of their surplus  or in case there is no surplus  out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
however  dividends may not be paid out of a corporation s net profits if  after the payment of the dividend  the corporation s capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
our capital management and dividend policy as part of our three year capital and strategic plan includes a policy to refrain from paying dividends in excess of 
per share per quarter  except when covered by operating earnings 
the amount of future dividends will depend on our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by our board of directors in accordance with the capital management and dividend policy 
it is the federal reserve s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year  and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
it is also the federal reserve s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries 
additionally  in consideration of the current financial and economic environment  the federal reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policies and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong 
further  it is the federal reserve policy that bank holding companies participating in the tarp and other government capital programs must comply on an ongoing basis with the pertinent capital and other requirements established by the us treasury including those explicitly set forth in eesa and related federal reserve supervisory policy 
moreover  a recipient of taxpayer funds through such capital programs should consider and communicate reasonably in advance to federal reserve supervisory staff how the bank holding company proposed dividends  capital redemptions  and capital repurchases are consistent with the requirements applicable to its receipt of capital under the program and related federal reserve supervisory policy  as well as its ability to redeem securities issued to the government prior to any contractual increase in the dividend rate without affecting safety and soundness 
the terms of our series b preferred stock and junior subordinated notes also limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
if we are not current in our payment of dividends on our series b preferred stock or in our payment of interest on our junior subordinated notes  we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
we have agreed under the memorandum of understanding with the frb sf that bancorp will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  declare or pay any dividends  make any payments on trust preferred securities  or make any other capital distributions 
in february   bancorp received federal reserve approval to make payments on our series b preferred stock and junior subordinated notes 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will approve such payments or dividends in the future 
the bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company 
the bancorp receives income through dividends paid by the bank 
the powers of the board of directors of the bank to declare a cash dividend to the bancorp are subject to california law  which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to stockholders made during such period 
where the above test is not met  cash dividends may still be paid  with the prior approval of the dfi in an amount not exceeding the greatest of i retained earnings of the bank  ii the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or iii the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
future cash dividends by the bank will also depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
under the memorandum of understanding entered into with the frb sf  the bancorp also agreed that it would not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank 
the bank did not pay a dividend to the bancorp in or  but paid dividends of million to bancorp following regulatory approval in  and will pay additional dividends with regulatory approval in to maintain bancorp s cash balance equal to at least two years of bancorp s operating expenses and to be in a position  subject to regulatory approval  to repurchase in installments during the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
operations and consumer compliance laws the bank must comply with numerous federal anti money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations  including the usa patriot act  the bank secrecy act  the foreign account tax compliance act effective  the cra  the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act  the equal credit opportunity act  the truth in lending act  the fair housing act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the national flood insurance act  and various federal and state privacy protection laws 
the bank and the company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices  untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition 
these laws and regulations also mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to lawsuits and penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers  and the loss of certain contractual rights 
the dodd frank act provided for the creation of the cfpb as an independent entity within the federal reserve and as a new regulatory agency for united states banks 
the cfpb has broad rulemaking  supervisory  and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services  including deposit products  residential mortgages  home equity loans and credit cards 
the cfpb s functions include investigating consumer complaints  conducting market research  rulemaking  supervising and examining bank consumer transactions  and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services 
the cfpb examines banks such as the bank with over billion in assets 
banks with less than billion in assets are examined for compliance with the consumer laws and regulations by their primary federal banking agency 
under the dodd frank act  regulators were required to mandate specific underwriting criteria to support a reasonable  good faith determination by lenders of a consumer ability to repay a mortgage 
the cfpb by amendment to regulation z  which implements the truth in lending act and takes effect january   has defined what would be considered a qualified mortgage 
another dodd frank provision requires banks and other mortgage lenders to retain a minimum economic interest in mortgage loans sold through securitizations unless the loans meet a definition of a qualified residential mortgage yet to be promulgated 
banks will have to reevaluate their underwriting standards and the extent and type of their mortgage lending as a result of these regulations implementing the dodd frank act 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
each member of the fhlb of san francisco is required to own stock in an amount equal to the greater of i a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or ii an activity based stock requirement based on a percentage of outstanding advances 
there can be no assurance that the fhlb will pay dividends at the same rate it has paid in the past  or that it will pay any dividends in the future 
impact of monetary policies the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies 
the federal reserve implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the federal reserve banks 
the actions of the federal reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits  and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
securities and corporate governance the bancorp is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  both as administered by the sec 
as a company listed on the nasdaq capital market  the company is subject to nasdaq listing standards for listed companies 
the bancorp is also subject to the sarbanes oxley act of  provisions of the dodd frank act  and other federal and state laws and regulations which address  among other issues  required executive certification of financial presentations  corporate governance requirements for board audit committees and their members  and disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  auditing and accounting  executive compensation  and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information 
nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules  which are intended to allow stockholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors 
audit requirements the bank is required to have an annual independent audit  alone or as a part of its bank holding company s audit  and to prepare all financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the bank and the bancorp are also each required to have an audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors 
as required by nasdaq  the bancorp has certified that its audit committee has adopted formal written charters and meets the requisite number of directors  independence  and qualification standards 
as such  among other requirements  the bancorp must maintain an audit committee that includes members with banking or related financial management expertise  has access to its own outside counsel  and does not include members who are large customers of the bank 
in addition  because the bank has more than billion in total assets  it is subject to the fdic requirements for audit committees of large institutions 
under the sarbanes oxley act  management and the bancorp s independent registered public accounting firm are required to assess the effectiveness of the bancorp s internal control over financial reporting as of december  these assessments are included in part ii item a controls and procedures 
regulation of non bank subsidiaries non bank subsidiaries are subject to additional or separate regulation and supervision by other state  federal and self regulatory bodies 
additionally  any foreign based subsidiaries would also be subject to foreign laws and regulations 
item a 
risk factors 
difficult business and economic conditions can adversely affect our industry and business 
our financial performance generally  and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay the principal of outstanding loans and the value of the collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the united states as a whole 
although the us economy has recently showed signs of improvement  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain soft  and unemployment remains high in general and in the markets in which we operate 
local governments and many businesses are still experiencing serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and liquidity in the credit markets 
there is also uncertainty over the federal budget and taxation 
in addition  concerns about the performance of international economies  including the potential impact of the european debt crises and economic conditions in asia  particularly the economies of china and taiwan  can impact the economy here in the united states 
concerns about the economy have also resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
these economic pressures on consumers and businesses may continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we face increased regulation of our industry  including changes by congress or federal regulatory agencies to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regime and heightened legal standards and regulatory requirements that may be adopted in the future 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
our banking operations are concentrated primarily in california  and secondarily in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  illinois  new jersey  and hong kong 
adverse economic conditions in these regions in particular could impair borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  and erode the value of loan collateral 
these conditions include the effects of the general decline in real estate sales and prices in many markets across the united states from their recent highs  the economic recession of recent years  and higher rates of unemployment 
these conditions could increase the amount of our non performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non performing assets including other real estate owned on terms favorable to us  if at all  and could also cause a decline in demand for our products and services  or a lack of growth or a decrease in deposits  any of which may cause us to incur losses  adversely affect our capital  and hurt our business 
we may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses and charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
at december   our allowance for loan losses totaled million and we had total charge offs of million for although economic conditions in the real estate market in portions of los angeles  san diego  riverside  and san bernardino counties and the central valley of california where many of our commercial real estate and construction loan customers are based  have improved  the economic recovery in these areas of california is still slow 
this slow recovery has resulted in weak pricing and relatively elevated inventories of homes to be sold  which could contribute to financial strain on home builders and suppliers 
as of december   we had approximately billion in commercial real estate and construction loans 
any deterioration in the real estate market generally and in the commercial real estate and residential building segments in particular could result in additional loan charge offs and provisions for loan losses in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  net income  and capital 
the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of probable credit losses 
actual credit losses in excess of the estimate could adversely affect our results of operations and capital 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses because borrowers  guarantors  and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases 
the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the allowance for credit losses is based on management s estimate of the probable losses from our credit portfolio 
if actual losses exceed the estimate  the excess losses could adversely affect our results of operations and capital 
such excess losses could also lead to larger allowances for credit losses in future periods  which could in turn adversely affect results of operations and capital in those periods 
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in the estimate or adverse developments arise with respect to our credits  future losses may occur  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain credit losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for credit losses 
we are currently subject to a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of san francisco  and the bank was previously subject to a memorandum of understanding with the california department of financial institutions and the federal deposit insurance corporation  and we may be subject to further supervisory action by bank supervisory authorities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and the value of our common stock 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of financial institutions  the frb sf has authority over bancorp and separately the dfi and fdic have authority over the bank to compel or restrict certain actions if the bancorp or the bank s capital should fall below adequate capital standards as a result of operating losses  or if these regulators otherwise determine that the bancorp or the bank have insufficient capital or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices 
these regulators  as well as the cfpb  also have authority over the bancorp and the bank over compliance with various statutes and consumer protection and other regulations 
among other matters  the corrective actions may include  but are not limited to  requiring the bancorp and or the bank to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders  including board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements  supervisory letters  commitment letters  and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and refrain from unsafe and unsound practices  removing officers and directors  assessing civil monetary penalties  and taking possession of and closing and liquidating the bank 
on december   the bancorp entered into a memorandum of understanding with the frb sf the mou under which the bancorp agreed  among other things  to limitations on payment of and receipt of dividends and senior executive officer and director changes  and to submit a plan to maintain sufficient capital  a plan to improve management of our liquidity position and funds management practices  and a liquidity policy and contingency funding plan for the bancorp 
until it was terminated as of november   the bank was subject to a memorandum of understanding with the dfi and the fdic that was entered into on march   by which the bank agreed to undertake certain steps to strengthen its operations 
this included  among other things  the submission of satisfactory plans to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to enhance and to improve the quality of our stress testing of the bank s loan portfolio  to address improved profitability and capital ratios and reduce the bank s overall risk profile  to improve asset quality  and to reduce dependence on wholesale funding 
in addition  we were required to maintain management and a board acceptable to the dfi and fdic 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of  any such memoranda or other corrective actions  we could become subject to additional supervisory action  including a cease and desist order 
if our banking supervisors were to take such additional supervisory action  we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business  our financial condition  and the value of our common stock 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to further supervisory action or regulatory proceedings that could have a material negative impact on our business 
additional requirements imposed by the dodd frank act could adversely affect us 
recent government efforts to strengthen the us financial system have resulted in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements  including expansive financial services regulatory reform legislation 
the dodd frank act provided for sweeping regulatory changes including the establishment of strengthened capital and liquidity requirements for banks and bank holding companies  including minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements no less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment  the requirement by statute that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries  enhanced regulation of financial markets  including the derivative and securitization markets  and the elimination of certain proprietary trading activities by banks  additional corporate governance and executive compensation requirements  enhanced financial institution safety and soundness regulations  revisions in fdic insurance assessment fees and a permanent increase in fdic deposit insurance coverage to  authorization for financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts through  and the establishment of new regulatory bodies  such as the cfpb and the financial services oversight counsel  to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation 
many of the provisions remain subject to final rulemaking and or study 
accordingly  we cannot fully assess its impact on our operations and costs until final regulations are adopted and implemented 
current and future legal and regulatory requirements  restrictions  and regulations  including those imposed under the dodd frank act  may adversely impact our profitability and may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations  may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes required by the legislation and related regulations and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees 
we may become subject to more stringent capital requirements 
the us federal bank regulators have jointly proposed new capital requirements on banks and bank holding companies as required by the dodd frank act that incorporate the elements of basel committee s basel iii accords and which  may have the effect of raising our capital requirements and imposing new capital requirements beyond those required by current law 
increased regulatory capital requirements and the associated compliance costs whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations  changes in existing laws and regulations  or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may impact our ability to pay dividends and may have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive laws and regulations and supervision  and may become subject to future laws and regulations and supervision  if any  that may be enacted  that could limit or restrict our activities  may hamper our ability to increase our assets and earnings  and could adversely affect our profitability 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are or may become subject to regulation by federal  state  and local governmental authorities and various laws  regulations  regulatory guidelines  and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements or restrictions on part or all of our operations  capitalization  payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
we also must comply with numerous federal anti money laundering and consumer protection statutes and regulations 
a considerable amount of management time and resources have been devoted to the oversight of  and the development and implementation of controls and procedures relating to  compliance with these laws and regulations  and we expect that significant time and resources will be devoted to compliance in the future 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which we must deal with our customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
we also are  or may become subject to  examination  supervision  and additional comprehensive regulation by various federal  state  and local authorities with regard to compliance with these laws and regulations 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws  rules  regulations  and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change 
perennially  various laws  rules and regulations are proposed  which  if adopted  could impact our operations  increase our capital requirements or substantially restrict our growth and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably by making compliance much more difficult or expensive  restricting our ability to originate or sell loans or further restricting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products 
in addition  further regulation could increase the assessment rate we are required to pay to the fdic  adversely affecting our earnings 
furthermore  recent changes to regulation z promulgated by the cfpb may make it more difficult for us to underwrite consumer mortgages and to compete with large national mortgage service providers 
it is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on the banking and financial services industry in general or on our business in particular 
such changes may  among other things  increase the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
the dodd frank act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector 
other changes to statutes  regulations  or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations  or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations  or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties  and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see part i item business regulation and supervision 
we may experience goodwill impairment 
goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized  but is reviewed at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if our estimates of goodwill fair value change  we may determine that impairment charges are necessary 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons 
if management s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate  the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans  and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential  or spread  between the interest earned on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates  events over which we have no control  may have an adverse effect on net interest income 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels  which are also impacted by changes in interest rates  can significantly affect our assets and liabilities 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations  which could in turn lead to an increase in non performing assets and net charge offs 
generally  the interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of re pricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
certain assets  such as fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
we seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
we use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in estimating the optimal asset liability composition 
however  such management tools have inherent limitations that impair their effectiveness 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
we have engaged in expansion through acquisitions and may consider additional acquisitions in the future  which could negatively affect our business and earnings 
we have engaged in expansion through acquisitions and may consider acquisitions in the future 
there are risks associated with any such expansion 
these risks include  among others  incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction  encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses  facing resistance from customers or employees  and being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction 
additional country and region specific risks are associated with transactions outside the united states  including in china 
to the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions  if any  these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership 
our earnings  financial condition  and prospects after a merger or acquisition depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company 
we may be unable to integrate operations successfully or to achieve expected cost savings 
any cost savings which are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings 
in addition  our ability to grow may be limited if we cannot make acquisitions 
we compete with other financial institutions with respect to proposed acquisitions 
we cannot predict if or when we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms 
we may in the future engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
in the current economic environment  and subject to any requisite regulatory consent  we may potentially be presented with opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions 
these acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the fdic might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution 
however  because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition  including preparing for integration of an acquired institution  we may face additional risks if we engage in fdic assisted transactions 
these risks include the loss of customers  strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems 
if we engage in fdic assisted transactions  we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with these transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability 
moreover  even if we were inclined to participate in an fdic assisted transaction  there are no assurances that the fdic would allow us to participate or what the terms of such a transaction might be or whether we would be successful in acquiring the bank or assets that we are seeking 
we may be required to raise additional capital as a condition to  or as a result of  participation in an fdic assisted transaction 
any such transactions and related issuances of stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership 
furthermore  to the extent we are allowed to  and choose to  participate in fdic assisted transactions  we may face competition from other financial institutions with respect to the proposed fdic assisted transactions 
to the extent that our competitors are selected to participate in fdic assisted transactions  our ability to identify and attract acquisition candidates and or make acquisitions on favorable terms may be adversely affected 
inflation and deflation may adversely affect our financial performance 
the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation or deflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
conversely  deflation will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality 
virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general levels of inflation or deflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
as we expand our business outside of california markets  we will encounter risks that could adversely affect us 
we primarily operate in california markets with a concentration of chinese american individuals and businesses  however  one of our strategies is to expand beyond california into other domestic markets that have concentrations of chinese american individuals and businesses 
we currently have operations in six other states new york  texas  washington  massachusetts  illinois  and new jersey and in hong kong 
in the course of this expansion  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these risks and uncertainties include increased expenses and operational difficulties arising from  among other things  our ability to attract sufficient business in new markets  to manage operations in noncontiguous market areas  to comply with all of the various local laws and regulations  and to anticipate events or differences in markets in which we have no current experience 
to the extent that we expand through acquisitions  such acquisitions may also adversely harm our business if we fail to adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions 
for example  risks can include difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurring of additional debt and contingent liabilities  use of cash resources  large write offs  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets with finite lives 
our loan portfolio is largely secured by real estate  which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations 
the downturn in the real estate markets in recent years hurt our business because many of our loans are secured by real estate 
the real estate collateral securing our borrowers obligations is principally located in california  and to a lesser extent  in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  illinois  and new jersey 
the value of such collateral depends upon conditions in the relevant real estate markets 
these include general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  unemployment rates  real estate tax rates  the cost of operating the properties  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  acts of nature including earthquakes  floods  and hurricanes which may result in uninsured losses  and other factors beyond our control 
the continuing low volume of real estate sales and unpredictability of prices in many markets across the united states could reduce the value of our collateral  in which case we may have to foreclose on the properties 
if we are not able to realize a satisfactory amount upon foreclosure sales  we may have to own the properties  subjecting us to exposure to the risks and expenses associated with ownership 
continued declines in real estate sales and prices coupled with any weakness in the economy and continued high unemployment will result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets  a decline in demand for our products and services  or a lack of growth or a decrease in deposits  which may cause us to incur losses  adversely affect our capital  and hurt our business 
the risks inherent in construction lending may continue to affect adversely our results of operations 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that contractors may fail to complete  or complete on a timely basis  construction of the relevant properties  substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing  market deterioration during construction  and lack of permanent take out financing 
loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because they have no operating history 
in these loans  loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction and the estimated operating cash flow to be generated by the completed project 
there is no assurance that such properties will be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower 
the current general decline in real estate sales and prices across the united states  the decline in demand for residential real estate  economic weakness  high rates of unemployment  and reduced availability of mortgage credit  are all factors that can adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral  and thereby adversely affect our results of operations and financial results 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan secured by real property  we require an appraisal of the property 
however  an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made 
if the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
liabilities from environmental regulations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in the course of the bank s business  the bank may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
the bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clear up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of any contaminated site  the bank may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages  and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if the bank ever becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities  its business  financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we face substantial competition from our competitors 
we face substantial competition for deposits  loans  and for other banking services  as well as acquisitions  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
these banks and financial institutions have greater resources than we do  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand and make acquisitions 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  they have substantially greater lending limits than we do and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies has increased the level of competition among financial services companies and may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of  and experience in  the communities that we serve 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing  and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives and certain other employees  including  but not limited to  our chief executive officer  dunson k 
cheng  our chief financial officer  heng w 
chen  and our chief operating officer  peter wu 
managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers  investors  and employees 
threats to our reputation can come from many sources  including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally  unethical practices  employee misconduct  failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality  compliance deficiencies  and questionable  illegal  or fraudulent activities of our customers 
we have policies and procedures in place that seek to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct  but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
negative publicity regarding our business  employees  or customers  with or without merit  may result in the loss of customers  investors  and employees  costly litigation  a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation 
natural disasters and geopolitical events beyond our control could adversely affect us 
natural disasters such as earthquakes  wildfires  extreme weather conditions  hurricanes  floods  and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving civil unrest  changes in government regimes  terrorism  or military conflict could adversely affect our business operations and those of our customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property 
these natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair our borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  erode the value of loan collateral  and result in an increase in the amount of our non performing loans and a higher level of non performing assets including real estate owned  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses  which could adversely affect our earnings 
adverse conditions in asia and elsewhere could adversely affect our business 
a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to asia and  as a result  we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions in asia  including the effects of rising inflation or slowing growth in china and other regions 
additionally  we maintain a branch in hong kong 
us and global economic policies  military tensions  and unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the asian economies 
this could include an actual or perceived default of certain european union eu member states on their debt obligations  the continued uncertainty of the eu s financial support programs  the possibility that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles  and any resulting slowdown in the economies of the eu member states 
in addition  pandemics and other public health crises or concerns over the possibility of such crises could create economic and financial disruptions in the region 
a significant deterioration of economic conditions in asia could expose us to  among other things  economic and transfer risk  and we could experience an outflow of deposits by those of our customers with connections to asia 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments with or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions in asia  and in china or taiwan in particular  may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers who operate in this region 
because of our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement between us and the us treasury the purchase agreement  under which we sold million of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b  with a liquidation preference of  per share series b preferred stock  we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and the three next most highly compensated executive officers 
the standards include i ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executive officers does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  ii requiring clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive officer based on statements of earnings  gains  or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  iii a prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and iv agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation will likely increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods 
the adoption of the arra on february   and interim final regulations thereunder effective june   have imposed certain executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients  including the company  until the institution has repaid the us treasury or  in certain instances  until the us treasury no longer holds our securities  which is now permitted under the arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
the arra executive compensation standards are in many respects more stringent than those that continue in effect under tarp and those previously proposed by the us treasury 
the standards include but are not limited to i prohibitions on bonuses  retention awards and other incentive compensation  other than restricted stock or restricted stock unit grants for up to one third of an employee s total annual compensation  which grants cannot vest for a period of at least two years and can be liquidated during the tarp period only in proportion to the repayment of the tarp investment at increments  ii prohibitions on golden parachute payments for departure from a company or change in control of the company  iii an expanded clawback of bonuses  retention awards  and incentive compensation if payment is based on materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria  iv prohibitions on compensation plans that encourage manipulation of reported earnings  v retroactive review of bonuses  retention awards  and other compensation previously provided by tarp recipients if found by the us treasury to be inconsistent with the purposes of tarp or otherwise contrary to the public interest  vi required establishment of a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  and vii inclusion in a participant s proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings of a nonbinding say on pay shareholder vote on the compensation of executives 
our information systems may experience failures  interruptions  or breaches in security  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption  or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  and other systems 
in the course of providing financial services  we store personally identifiable data concerning customers or employees of customers 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption  or security breaches of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions  or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
privacy laws and regulations are matters of growing public concern and are continually changing in the states in which we operate 
in recent periods  there has been a rise in electronic fraudulent activity  security breaches  and cyber attacks within the financial services industry  especially in the commercial banking sector 
some financial institutions have reported breaches of their security of their websites and systems  some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information  destroy data  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems 
the secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information  as well as execution of transactions over our systems  are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our customers confidence 
increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication  advances in computer capabilities  or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology  processes  and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions or to protect data about us  our customers  and underlying transactions  as well as the technology used by our customers to access our systems 
these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our offerings of mobile services and other internet or web based products 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions  or security breaches could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customers  cause us to incur additional expenses  disrupt our business  affect our ability to grow our online and mobile banking services  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our need to continue to adapt our information technology systems to allow us to provide new and expanded service and to successfully implement the core system conversion we are currently undergoing  could present operational issues  require significant capital spending  and disrupt our business 
as we continue to offer internet banking and other on line and mobile services to our customers  and continue to expand our existing conventional banking services  we will need to adapt our information technology systems to handle these changes in a way that meets constantly changing industry and regulatory standards 
this can be very expensive and may require significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our success will depend on  among other things  our ability to provide secure and reliable services  anticipate changes in technology  and efficiently develop and introduce services that are accepted by our customers and cost effective for us to provide 
we are also in the process of undergoing a core system conversion to a new third party provider 
if we are not able to successfully implement the core system conversion in the time frame we currently anticipate and with minimal interruption to our systems and customers  our business could be harmed 
our business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings 
various aspects of our operations involve the risk of legal liability 
we have been  and expect to continue to be  named or threatened to be named as defendants in legal proceedings arising from our business activities 
we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those proceedings indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  but we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss 
in addition  amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from those legal proceedings 
thus  our ultimate losses may be higher or lower  and possibly significantly so  than the amounts accrued for loss contingencies arising from legal proceedings 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  and our restated bylaws  as amended  could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
these provisions include authorized but unissued shares of preferred and common stock that may be issued without stockholder approval  three classes of directors serving staggered terms  special requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for director  and super majority voting requirements in certain situations including certain types of business combinations 
our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and the sec will change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  federal and state taxing authorities will change the tax laws and regulations  and their interpretations 
these changes and their effects can be difficult to predict and can materially and adversely impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for you to sell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts  failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings estimates  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  acquisitions of other banks or financial institutions  through fdic assisted transactions or otherwise  actions by institutional stockholders  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  general market conditions and  in particular  developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry  proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments  anticipated or pending investigations  proceedings  or litigation that involve or affect us  successful management of reputational risk  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock market and  in particular  the market for financial institution stocks  has experienced significant volatility 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur 
the trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including  without limitation  our financial condition  performance  creditworthiness and prospects  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  and other factors identified above in forward looking statements  and in this item a risk factors 
the capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption 
such volatility and disruption can reach unprecedented levels  resulting in downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
a significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
statutory restrictions and restrictions by our regulators on dividends and other distributions from the bank may adversely impact us by limiting the amount of distributions the bancorp may receive 
statutory and contractual restrictions and our regulators may also restrict the bancorp s ability to pay dividends 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us is limited by various regulations and statutes  including california law  and our ability to pay dividends on our outstanding stock is limited by various regulations and statutes  including delaware law 
a substantial portion of bancorp s cash flow has in earlier years come from dividends that the bank pays to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
the federal reserve board has previously issued federal reserve supervision and regulation letter sr that states that bank holding companies are expected to inform and consult with the federal reserve supervisory staff prior to taking any actions that could result in a diminished capital base  including any payment or increase in the rate of dividends 
in addition  we have agreed under the memorandum of understanding with the frb sf that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  i receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank  or ii declare or pay any dividends  make any payments on trust preferred securities  or make any other capital distributions 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will approve the payment of such dividends 
further  if we are not current in our payment of dividends on our series b preferred stock or interest on our junior subordinated notes  we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
if the bank were to liquidate  the bank s creditors would be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of the bank to satisfy their claims against the bank before bancorp  as a holder of the equity interest in the bank  would be entitled to receive any of the assets of the bank as a distribution or dividend 
the restrictions described above  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant  described below  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
moreover  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
our outstanding preferred stock impacts net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share  and the warrant as well as other potential issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends declared and the accretion on discount on our outstanding preferred stock will reduce the net income available to common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
our outstanding preferred stock is perpetual and currently bears a dividend rate of per annum 
if we do not redeem or otherwise retire our preferred stock  this dividend rate increases to per annum commencing in december our outstanding preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of our liquidation  dissolution  or winding up 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant is exercised 
the  shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 
in addition  to the extent options to purchase common stock under our stock option plans are exercised  holders of our common stock will incur additional dilution 
we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities 
if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities  these sales could result in increased dilution to our stockholders 
see we may need to raise additional capital which may dilute the interests of holders of our common stock or otherwise have an adverse effect on their investment below 
the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of common stock  which may negatively impact their investment 
our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the stockholders 
the board of directors also has the power  without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation  dissolution  or winding up of our business and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected 
our outstanding debt securities restrict our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock 
we have issued an aggregate of million in trust preferred securities collectively  the trust preferred securities 
payments to investors in respect of the trust preferred securities are funded by distributions on certain series of securities issued by us  with similar terms to the relevant series of trust preferred securities  which we refer to as the junior subordinated notes 
in addition  in september  the bank issued million in subordinated debt in a private placement the bank subordinated debt 
if we are unable to pay interest in respect of the junior subordinated notes which will be used to make distributions on the trust preferred securities  or if any other event of default occurs  then we will generally be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends or other distributions  or redeeming  purchasing or acquiring  any of our capital securities  including the common stock  during the next succeeding interest payment period applicable to any of the junior subordinated notes 
if the bank is unable to pay interest in respect of the bank subordinated debt  or if any other event of default has occurred and is continuing on the bank subordinated debt  then the bank will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or other distributions  or redeeming  purchasing or acquiring  any of its capital stock  during the next succeeding interest payment applicable to the bank subordinated debt 
as a result  the bank will be prohibited from making dividend payments to us  which  in turn could affect our ability to pay dividends on our capital securities  including the common stock 
moreover  any other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock  including the common stock 
in the event that any other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay such dividends  we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on the common stock unless we can refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements 
we may need to raise additional capital which may dilute the interests of holders of our common stock or otherwise have an adverse effect on their investment 
should economic conditions deteriorate  particularly in the california commercial real estate and residential real estate markets where our business is concentrated  we may need to raise more capital to support any additional provisions for loan losses and loan charge offs 
in addition  we may need to raise more capital to meet other regulatory requirements  including new required capital standards  if our losses are higher than expected  if we are unable to meet our capital requirements or if additional capital is required for our growth 
there can be no assurances that we would succeed in raising any such additional capital  and any capital we obtain may dilute the interests of holders of our common stock  or otherwise have an adverse effect on their investment 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  and other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us 
the failure of financial institutions can also result in increased fdic assessments for the deposit insurance fund 
any such losses or increased assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion is intended to provide information to facilitate the understanding and assessment of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the bancorp and its subsidiaries 
it should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the bank offers a wide range of financial services 
it currently operates branches in southern california  branches in northern california  eight branches in new york state  one branch in massachusetts  two branches in texas  three branches in washington state  three branches in illinois  one branch in new jersey  one branch in hong kong and two representative offices one in shanghai  china  and one in taipei  taiwan 
the bank is a commercial bank  servicing primarily individuals  professionals  and small to medium sized businesses in the local markets in which its branches are located 
the financial information presented herein includes the accounts of the bancorp  its subsidiaries  including the bank  and the bank s consolidated subsidiaries 
all material transactions between these entities are eliminated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses the determination of the amount of the provision for credit losses charged to operations reflects management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in economic and business conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management  changes in the volume and severity of past due  non accrual  and adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the quality of the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and the effect of competition  legal and regulatory requirements  and other external factors 
the nature of the process by which we determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 
the total allowance for credit losses consists of two components specific allowances and general allowances 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  we employ two primary methodologies  the individual loan review analysis methodology and the classification migration methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of our allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  and environmental factors which include trends in delinquency and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as the national and local economy  the volume and composition of the portfolio  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and the concentration of credit 
the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with accounting standard codification asc section for non impaired credits  a general allowance is established for those loans internally classified and risk graded pass  minimally acceptable  special mention  or substandard based on historical losses in the specific loan portfolio and a reserve based on environmental factors determined for that loan group 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the allowance for credit losses is discussed in more detail in risk elements of the loan portfolio allowance for credit losses below 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under asc topic  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
asc topic requires us to assess whether we have the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
other than temporary impairment related to credit losses will be recognized in earnings 
other than temporary impairment related to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income reported for financial statement purposes  and differs from the amount of taxes currently payable  since certain income and expense items are reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than those for tax reporting purposes 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
goodwill and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
asc topic  formerly sfas no 
 business combinations revised  requires an entity to recognize the assets  liabilities and any non controlling interest at fair value as of the acquisition date 
contingent consideration is required to be recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of that consideration may be determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
asc topic also requires an entity to expense acquisition related costs as incurred rather than allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
contingent considerations are to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date in a business combination and would be subject to the probable and estimable recognition criteria of asc topic  accounting for contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  formerly sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our policy is to assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or between annual assessments if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
accounting standards require management to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit in making the assessment of impairment at least annually 
the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc topic the two step impairment testing process conducted by us  if needed  begins by assigning net assets and goodwill to our three reporting units commercial lending  retail banking  and east coast operations 
we then complete step one of the impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit as determined in note to the consolidated financial statements below with the recorded book value or carrying amount of its net assets  with goodwill included in the computation of the carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired  and step two of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  step two of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of impairment 
step two of the impairment test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is computed by assuming all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit would be adjusted to the current fair value  with the offset as an adjustment to goodwill 
this adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value used in step two 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
valuation of other real estate owned oreo real estate acquired in the settlement of loans is initially recorded at fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
specific valuation allowances on other real estate owned are recorded through charges to operations to recognize declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure 
gains on sales are recognized when certain criteria relating to the buyer s initial and continuing investment in the property are met

if either of these conditions is met  an entity must recognize an other than temporary impairment otti to its investment securities 
if an entity does not intend to sell the debt security and will not be required to sell the debt security  the entity must consider whether it will recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
if the present value of expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the security  otti shall be considered to have occurred 
otti is then separated into the amount of the total impairment related to credit losses and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
an entity determines the impairment related to credit losses by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security 
otti related to the credit loss is thereafter recognized in earnings 
otti related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
otti not related to the credit loss for a held to maturity security should be recognized separately in a new category of other comprehensive income and amortized over the remaining life of the debt security as an increase in the carrying value of the security only when the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis 
the company has both the ability and the intent to hold and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell those securities with unrealized losses before recovery of their amortized cost basis 
the company unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds relates to a number of investments in bonds of financial institutions  all of which were investment grade at the date of acquisition and as of december  the unrealized losses were primarily caused by the widening of credit and liquidity spreads since the dates of acquisition 
the contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuers to settle the security at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
the company currently does not believe it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the investments 
therefore  it is expected that these bonds would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
because the company does not intend to sell and would not be required to sell these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  it does not consider its investments in these corporate bonds to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the temporarily impaired securities represent of the fair value of investment securities as of december  unrealized losses for securities with unrealized losses for less than twelve months represent  and securities with unrealized losses for twelve months or more represent  of the historical cost of these securities 
unrealized losses on these securities generally resulted from increases in interest rate spreads subsequent to the date that these securities were purchased 
at december   issues of securities had unrealized losses for months or longer and seven issues of securities had unrealized losses of less than months 
at december   management believed the impairment was temporary and  accordingly  no impairment loss has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
we expect to recover the amortized cost basis of our debt securities  and have no intent to sell and will not be required to sell available for sale debt securities that have declined below their cost before their anticipated recovery

in the normal course of business  we enter into various transactions  which  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
loan commitments 
we enter into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses 
standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to secure the obligations of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of an agreement with the third party  we would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  we would be entitled to seek reimbursement from the customer 
our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements

dividend policy holders of common stock are entitled to dividends as and when declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends 
although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so 
commencing with the second quarter of  our board of directors reduced our common stock dividend to 
per share and to 
per share thereafter 
in january  we adopted a capital management and dividend policy as part of our three year capital and strategic plan which included a policy to refrain from paying dividends in excess of 
per share per quarter  except when covered by operating earnings 
on november   the federal reserve issued guidance that bank holding companies with u 
s 
government investments still outstanding should not increase dividend payouts 
the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings  financial condition  approval by our regulators  the repayment of our series b preferred stock  capital requirements  and other factors  and will be determined by our board of directors in accordance with the capital management and dividend policy 
substantially all of the revenues of the company available for payment of dividends derive from amounts paid to it by the bank 
the terms of the bank subordinated debt limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us if the bank is not current in paying interest on the bank subordinated debt or another event of default has occurred 
under the memorandum of understanding we entered into with the federal reserve bank of san francisco frb sf  we agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank 
the bank did not pay dividends to bancorp in both and in our february  three year capital and strategic plan submitted to our regulators  we indicated that  subject to regulatory approval  the bank expected to pay a dividend of million to bancorp during the second quarter of to increase bancorp s cash balance to equal at least two years of bancorp s operating expenses and then additional quarterly dividends beginning in the third quarter of in an amount which would maintain cash balances at bancorp equal to at least two years of bancorp s operating expenses 
in addition  on december  after receipt of regulatory approvals  the bank paid a special dividend of million to bancorp to provide funding for a partial repayment of the series b preferred stock 
the bank paid dividends totaling million to bancorp during the terms of our series b preferred stock and junior subordinated notes also limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
if we are not current in our payment of dividends on our series b preferred stock or in our payment of interest on our junior subordinated notes  we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
the federal reserve board has previously issued federal reserve supervision and regulation letter sr that states that bank holding companies are expected to inform and consult with the federal reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid 
as a result of losses incurred in  we were expected to so inform and consult with the federal reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring or paying any dividends in the future 
bancorp received federal reserve approval to make payments on our series b preferred stock and junior subordinated notes 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will approve the payment of such dividends 
under california state banking law  the bank may not without regulatory approval pay a cash dividend which exceeds the lesser of the bank s retained earnings or its net income for the last three fiscal years  less any cash distributions made during that period 
under this regulation  the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends to the company immediately after december   was restricted to approximately million 
regulatory matters on december   the bancorp entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of san francisco frb sf under which we agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  i receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank  or ii declare or pay any dividends  make any payments on trust preferred securities  or make any other capital distributions 
we do not believe that this agreement regarding dividends from the bank will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we had retained a portion of the proceeds from our common stock offerings to be used  for among other things  payments of future dividends on our common and preferred stock and payments on trust preferred securities 
at december   our cash on hand totaled million which is sufficient to cover future dividends on our common stock at the current quarterly rate of 
per share  on our preferred stock  and interest on our trust preferred securities  subject to frb sf approval  for the next twelve months 
under the memorandum  we also agreed to submit to the frb sf for review and approval a plan to maintain sufficient capital at the company on a consolidated basis and at the bank  a dividend policy for the bancorp  a plan to improve management of our liquidity position and funds management practices  and a liquidity policy and contingency funding plan for the bancorp 
as part of our compliance with the memorandum  on january   we submitted to the frb sf a three year capital and strategic plan that updates a previously submitted plan and establishes  among other things  targets for our tier risk based capital ratio  total risk based capital ratio  tier leverage capital ratio and tangible common risk based ratio  each of which  where applicable  are above the minimum requirements for a well capitalized institution 
in addition  we agreed to notify the frb sf prior to effecting certain changes to our senior executive officers and board of directors and we are limited and or prohibited  in certain circumstances  in our ability to enter into contracts to pay and to make golden parachute severance and indemnification payments 
we also agreed in the memorandum that we will not  without the prior written approval of the frb sf  directly or indirectly  i incur  renew  increase or guaranty any debt  ii issue any trust preferred securities  or iii purchase  redeem  or otherwise acquire any of our stock 
the target  actual  and any excess or deficiency capital levels of the three year capital and strategic plan submitted to the frb sf are as follows as of december  tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage capital ratio tangible common risk based ratio actual target levels excess tier risk based capital excluding preferred stock  trust preferred stock and reit preferred stock divided by total risk weighted assets 
the bancorp has taken appropriate steps to comply with the terms of its memorandum of understanding with the frb sf and we believe we are in compliance with the memorandum 
we do not believe that the memorandum or our compliance activities will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition  including liquidity 
if we fail to comply with the terms of the memorandum  that failure could lead to additional enforcement action by the frb sf that could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
at december   we are in compliance with the applicable target ratios 
until it was terminated as of november   the bank was subject to a memorandum of understanding with the california department of financial institutions dfi and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic that was entered into on march   by which the bank agreed to undertake certain steps to strengthen its operations 
the bank was required to develop and implement  within specified time periods  plans satisfactory to the dfi and the fdic to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to enhance and to improve the quality of our stress testing of the bank s loan portfolio  and to revise our loan policy in connection therewith  to develop and adopt a strategic plan addressing improved profitability and capital ratios and to reduce the bank s overall risk profile  to develop and adopt a capital plan  to develop and implement a plan to improve asset quality  including the methodology for calculating the loss reserve allocation and evaluating its adequacy  and to develop and implement a plan to reduce dependence on wholesale funding 
in addition  we are required to report our progress to the dfi and fdic on a quarterly basis 
as part of our compliance with the bank memorandum  on april   we submitted to the dfi and the fdic a three year capital plan that updated the three year capital and strategic plan previously submitted to the frb sf on january   and established  among other things  targets for our tier risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio  each of which are above the minimum requirements for a well capitalized institution and effective june   a target tier to total tangible assets ratio 
we were in compliance with the applicable target ratios through the date of termination of the memorandum 
risk elements of the loan portfolio non performing assets non performing assets include loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and oreo 
our policy is to place loans on non accrual status if interest and principal or either interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against current income and subsequent payments received are generally first applied towards the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly for problem loans 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of the loan agreements

the concessions may be granted in various forms  including reduction in the stated interest rate  reduction in the amount of principal amortization  forgiveness of a portion of a loan balance or accrued interest  or extension of the maturity date 
although these loan modifications are considered under asc subtopic  formerly sfas  to be troubled debt restructurings  the loans must have  pursuant to the bank s policy  performed under the restructured terms and have demonstrated sustained performance under the modified terms for six months before being returned to accrual status 
the sustained performance considered by management pursuant to its policy includes the periods prior to the modification if the prior performance met or exceeded the modified terms

if loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent  we measure the impairment based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent  we measure the impairment by using the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
we obtain an appraisal to determine the amount of impairment at the date that the loan becomes impaired 
the appraisals are based on as is or bulk sale valuations 
to ensure that appraised values remain current  we generally obtain an updated appraisal every six months from qualified independent appraisers 
furthermore  if the most current appraisal is dated more than three months prior to the effective date of the impairment test  we validate the most current value with third party market data appropriate to the location and property type of the collateral 
if the third party market data indicates that the value of our collateral has declined since the most recent valuation date  we adjust downward the value of the property to reflect current market conditions 
if the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
if an impaired loan is expected to be collected through liquidation of the collateral  the amount of impairment  excluding disposal costs  which range between to of the fair value  depending on the size of impaired loan  is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
non accrual impaired loans are not returned to accruing status unless the unpaid interest has been brought current and full repayment of the recorded balance is expected or if the borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments of the scheduled amounts due  and are continued to be reviewed for impairment until they are no longer reported as troubled debt restructurings 
we identified impaired loans with a recorded investment of million at december   compared to million at december  the average balance of impaired loans was million in and million in we considered all non accrual loans to be impaired 
interest recognized on impaired loans totaled million in and million in as of december   million  or  of the million of non accrual portfolio loans was secured by real estate 
as of december   million  or  of the million of non accrual loans was secured by real estate 
in light of declining property values in the current economic downturn affecting the real estate markets  the bank has obtained current appraisals  sales contract  or other available market price information which provides updated factors in evaluating potential loss 
at december   million of the million allowance for loan losses was allocated for impaired loans and million was allocated to the general allowance 
at december   million of the million allowance for loan losses was allocated for impaired loans and million was allocated to the general allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses allocated to impaired loans increased from to as a result of the addition of two impaired construction loans 
in  net loan charge offs were million  or  of average loans  compared to million  or  of average loans in the allowance for credit losses to non accrual loans increased to at december   from at december  non accrual loans also include those troubled debt restructurings that do not qualify for accrual status

our construction and land development loans generally include optional renewal terms after the maturity of the initial loan term 
new appraisals are obtained prior to extension or renewal of these loans in part to determine the appropriate interest reserve to be established for the new loan term 
loans with interest reserves are underwritten to the same criteria  including loan to value and  if applicable  pro forma debt service coverage ratios  as loans without interest reserves 
construction loans with interest reserves are monitored on a periodic basis to gauge progress towards completion 
interest reserves are frozen if it is determined that additional draws would result in a loan to value ratio that exceeds policy maximums based on collateral property type 
our policy limits in this regard are consistent with supervisory limits and range from in the case of land to in the case of to family residential construction projects 
as of december   construction loans of million were disbursed with pre established interest reserves of million compared to million of such loans disbursed with pre established interest reserves of million at december  the balance for construction loans with interest reserves which have been extended was million with pre established interest reserves of  at december   and zero at december  land loans of million were disbursed with pre established interest reserves of  at december   compared to million land loans disbursed with pre established interest reserves of  at december  the balance for land loans with interest reserves which have been extended was zero at december   compared to million at december  at december   the bank had no loans on non accrual status with available interest reserves 
at december   million of non accrual residential construction loans  million of non accrual non residential construction loans  and million of non accrual land loans had been originated with pre established interest reserves 
at december   million of non accrual residential construction loans  million of non accrual non residential construction loans  and million of non accrual land loans had been originated with pre established interest reserves 
while loans with interest reserves are typically expected to be repaid in full according to the original contractual terms  some loans require one or more extensions beyond the original maturity 
typically  these extensions are required due to construction delays  delays in sales or lease of property  or some combination of these two factors 
loan concentration most of our business activity is with customers located in the predominantly asian areas of california  new york city  dallas and houston  texas  seattle  washington  boston  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  and new jersey 
we have no specific industry concentration  and generally our loans are collateralized with real property or other pledged collateral 
loans are generally expected to be paid off from the operating profits of the borrowers  refinancing by another lender  or through sale by the borrowers of the secured collateral 
we experienced no loan concentrations to multiple borrowers in similar activities that exceeded of total loans as of december  the federal banking regulatory agencies issued final guidance on december   regarding risk management practices for financial institutions with high or increasing concentrations of commercial real estate cre loans on their balance sheets 
the regulatory guidance reiterates the need for sound internal risk management practices for those institutions that have experienced rapid growth in cre lending  have notable exposure to specific types of cre  or are approaching or exceeding the supervisory criteria used to evaluate the cre concentration risk  but the guidance is not to be construed as a limit for cre exposure 
the supervisory criteria are total reported loans for construction  land development  and other land represent of the institution total risk based capital  and both total cre loans represent or more of the institution total risk based capital and the institution cre loan portfolio has increased or more within the last thirty six months

allowance for credit losses the bank maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks in the loan portfolio and off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments 
allowance for credit losses is comprised of allowances for loan losses and for off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments 
with this risk management objective  the bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans  and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for credit losses in a timely manner 
in addition  the board of directors of the bank has established a written credit policy that includes a credit review and control system which it believes should be effective in ensuring that the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses 
the board of directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations  and determines whether the allowance is adequate to absorb losses in the credit portfolio 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses is based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
additions to the allowance for credit losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts  if any  are credited to the allowance for credit losses 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality can result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  and defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses 
see part i item a risk factors for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance 
the allowance for loan losses was million and the allowance for off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments was million at december   and represented the amount that the company believes to be sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio including unfunded commitments

if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
general allowance the unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis 
segmentation is determined by loan type and common risk characteristics 
the non impaired loans are grouped into segments two commercial segments  ten commercial real estate segments  three residential construction segments  three non residential construction segments  one sba segment  one installment loans segment  one residential mortgage segment  one equity lines of credit segment  and one overdrafts segment 
the allowance is provided for each segmented group based on the group s historical loan loss experience aggregated based on loan risk classifications which takes into account the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  the prevailing value of the underlying collateral if collateral dependent  charge off history  management s knowledge of the portfolio  general economic conditions  and environmental factors which include the trends in delinquency and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as the national and local economy  volume and composition of the portfolio  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and concentration of credit 
in addition  management reviews reports on past due loans to ensure appropriate classifications 
during the second quarter of  in light of the continued deterioration in the economy and the increases in non accrual loans and charge offs  and based in part on regulatory considerations  we shortened the period used in the migration analysis from five years to four years to better reflect the impact of the most recent charge offs  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  we increased the general allowance to reflect the higher loan delinquency trends  the weaker national and local economy and the increased difficulty in assigning loan grades  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  and we also applied the environmental factors described above to loans rated minimally acceptable  special mention and substandard  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our migration loss analysis to reduce the weighting of the first two years of the four year migration analysis by half to better reflect the impact of more recent losses  and further segmented the construction loan portfolios into three geographic segments 
the changes made during the fourth quarter of did not have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses 
during the first quarter of  we increased the number of segments for commercial real estate loans from one to ten 
in addition  we changed our migration loss analysis to use as the reserve factor for loans rated pass the total weighted average losses during the last four years for each loan segment as well as the weighting for the four year migration so that the first two years are weighted one third and the most recent two years are weighted two thirds 
the changes made during the first quarter of increased the allowance for loan losses by million 
during the second quarter of  we further refined our methodology to give greater weighting to the most recent twelve months of charge offs in the calculation of the loan loss reserve percentage for pass rated loans  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  we discontinued the weighting in the four year migration analysis for loans rated lower than pass  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million  and we increased the environmental factors for purchased syndicated loans  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million 
during the first quarter of  we combined the number of segments for construction loans from nine to two by consolidating the previous three geographic groups of east coast  texas and all other regions into one bankwide region in light of the convergence of credit quality for construction loans of the three separate regions  which increased the allowance for loan losses by million

liquidity liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and customer credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace 
our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments  repayments from securities and loans  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and advances from the fhlb 
at december   our liquidity ratio defined as net cash and short term and marketable securities to net deposits and short term liabilities decreased to primarily due to lower securities balances  compared to at december  the bank is a shareholder of the fhlb  which enables the bank to have access to lower cost fhlb financing when necessary 
at december   the bank had an approved credit line with the fhlb of san francisco totaling billion 
total advances from the fhlb of san francisco were million at december  these borrowings bear fixed rates and are secured by loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the bank pledged million of its commercial loans to the federal reserve bank s discount window under the borrower in custody program 
the bank had borrowing capacity of million from the federal reserve bank discount window at december  liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets  which consist of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and securities available for sale 
at december   investment securities totaled billion  with billion pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments 
the remaining million was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings 
approximately of our time deposits mature within one year or less as of december  management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the bank s marketplace 
however  based on our historical runoff experience  we expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits 
management believes all the above mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months to the bank to meet its operating needs 
the business activities of the bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the bank and limited activities in other investments 
under the memorandum of understanding the bancorp entered into with the frb sf  we agreed that we will not  without the frb sf s prior written approval  receive any dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction of capital from the bank 
the bank did not pay a dividend to the bancorp in or  but paid dividends of million to bancorp following regulatory approval in  and will pay additional dividends with regulatory approval in to maintain bancorp s cash balance equal to at least two years of bancorp s operating expenses and to be in a position  subject to regulatory approval  to repurchase in installments during the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the principal market risk to the company is the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  deposit taking and borrowing activities  due to the fact that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not re price at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor and manage our interest rate risk through analyzing the re pricing characteristics of our loans  securities  deposits  and borrowings on an on going basis 
the primary objective is to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our earnings  and ultimately the underlying market value of equity  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
management uses certain basic measurement tools in conjunction with established risk limits to regulate its interest rate exposure 
due to the limitation inherent in any individual risk management tool  we use a simulation model to measure and quantify the impact to our profitability as well as to estimate changes to the market value of our assets and liabilities 
we use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending  investing  and funding rates to changing interest rates  so as to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk arises primarily through the traditional business activities of extending loans  investing securities  accepting deposits  and borrowings 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates  and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
the net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value  defined as net present value of assets and liabilities  under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in basis points increments 
although the modeling is helpful in managing interest rate risk  it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets  loan volumes and pricing  and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing  that might prove inaccurate 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income  or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume  changes in market conditions  and management strategies  among other factors 
the company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and attempts to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates 
we establish a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
when the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met or exceeded  we seek corrective action after considering  among other things  market conditions  customer reaction  and the estimated impact on profitability 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by  and if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 
our simulation model also projects the net market value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
we have established a tolerance level to value the net market value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities in our policy to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net market value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities would increase by  and conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net market value of our assets and liabilities would increase by 
quantitative information about interest rate risk the following table shows the carrying value of our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  as well as the instruments total fair values at december   and for assets  expected maturities are based on contractual maturity 
for liabilities  we use our historical experience and decay factors to estimate the deposit runoffs of interest bearing transactional deposits 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet commitments to extend credit  letters of credit  and bill of lading guarantees represent the contractual unfunded amounts 
off balance sheet financial instruments represent fair values 
the results presented may vary if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

total foreign country risk net exposures at december   were comprised primarily of million from china  million from hong kong  million from england  million from australia  million from france  million from switzerland  million from taiwan  million from canada  and million from singapore 
all foreign country risk net exposures were to non sovereign counterparties except million due from the hong kong monetary authority at december  unfunded exposures were million at december   and were comprised of million of unfunded loans to two financial institutions in china  a  unfunded loan to a corporation in canada  and a  of unfunded loan to a borrower in taiwan 
unfunded exposures were million at december   and were comprised of million of unfunded loans to two financial institutions in china  a million unfunded loan to a corporation in canada  and  of unfunded loans to two borrowers in taiwan 
financial derivatives it is our policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
however  we enter into financial derivatives in order to seek mitigation of exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  we may protect our position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the bank s investment committee 
we follow asc topic  which established accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
as of december   we had five interest rate swap agreements with two major financial institutions in the notional amount of million for a period of three years 
these interest rate swaps were not structured to hedge against inherent interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these five interest rate swap agreements all matured in the third quarter of the net amount accrued on these interest rate swaps and the changes in the market value of these interest rate swaps were recorded as a reduction to other non interest income in the amount of  in compared to million in the same period a year ago 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with various counter parties to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign exchange certificates of deposit  foreign exchange contracts  or foreign currency option contracts entered into with our clients 
these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of these contracts as well as the related foreign exchange certificates of deposit  foreign exchange contracts or foreign currency option contracts are recognized immediately in net income as a component of non interest income 
period end gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities 
at december   the notional amount of option contracts totaled  with a net negative fair value of  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had a positive fair value of million at december  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had a negative fair value of million at december  at december   the notional amount of option contracts totaled million with a net positive fair value of  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had a positive fair value  in the amount of million  at december  spot and forward contracts in the total notional amount of million had a negative fair value  in the amount of  at december
