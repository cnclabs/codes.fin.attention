interest rate risk 
the principal financial objective of the corporation interest rate risk management function is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to the fluctuation of interest rates 
the corporation  through the corporation asset liability committee  has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by managing the repricing mismatch between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the corporation assets by retaining loans with interest rates subject to periodic market adjustments 
in addition  the corporation maintains a liquid investment portfolio primarily comprised of us government agency mbs and government sponsored enterprise mbs that reprice frequently 
the corporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funding while utilizing fhlb san francisco advances as a secondary source of funding which can be structured with favorable interest rate risk characteristics 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the corporation promotes transaction accounts 
the corporation produces an internal interest rate risk model that measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is defined as the net present value of expected future cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the calculation is intended to illustrate the change in npv that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of    and basis points with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate change 
the following table sets forth as of june  the estimated changes in npv based on the indicated interest rate environment dollars in thousands 
basis points bp change in rates net portfolio value npv change portfolio value of assets npv as percentage of portfolio value assets sensitivity measure bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp represents the increase decrease of the npv at the indicated interest rate change in comparison to the npv at june  base case 
calculated as the npv divided by the portfolio value of total assets 
calculated as the change in the npv ratio from the base case amount assuming the indicated change in interest rates expressed in basis points 
the corporation balance sheet position as of june  can be summarized as follows if interest rates increase  the npv of the corporation is expected to increase since almost all of the corporation loans held for investment are adjustable rate loans 
conversely  if the interest rates decrease  the npv of the corporation is expected to decrease 
the following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the change in the npv at a basis point rate shock at june  and at june  at june  bp rate shock bp rate shock pre shock npv ratio npv as a of pv assets post shock npv ratio npv as a of pv assets sensitivity measure change in npv ratio bp bp tb a level of risk minimal minimal as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed when calculating the results described in the tables above 
it is also possible that  as a result of an interest rate increase  the higher mortgage payments required from arm borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in market interest rates may also affect the volume and profitability of the corporation s mortgage banking operations 
accordingly  the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates 
furthermore  the npv presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the corporation  nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the corporation 
the corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the month period subsequent to any given month end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for the corporation s current balance sheet  month business plan  embedded options  rate floors  periodic caps  lifetime caps  and loan  investment  deposit and borrowing cash flows  among others  and immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus   and and minus basis points 
the following table describes the results of the analysis at june  and at june  at june  basis point bp change in rates change in net interest income basis point bp change in rates change in net interest income bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp at both june  and  the corporation was asset sensitive as its interest earning assets are expected to reprice more quickly than its interest bearing liabilities during the subsequent month period 
therefore  in a rising interest rate environment  the model projects an increase in net interest income over the subsequent month period 
in a falling interest rate environment  the results project a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent month period 
management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable 
however  past experience has shown that immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur 
additionally  while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates  actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis  particularly with respect to the month business plan when asset growth is forecast 
therefore  the model results that the corporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the corporation s current disclosure to previous disclosures  over time  within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve
