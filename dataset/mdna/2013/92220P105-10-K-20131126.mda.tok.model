item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal year  total revenues increased over fiscal year  and net earnings from operations per diluted share increased over fiscal year during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of vms common stock 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we changed the presentation of reported orders from net orders to gross orders 
gross orders are defined as the sum of new orders recorded during the period adjusted for any revisions to existing orders during the period 
we believe that presentation of gross orders is more consistent and improves comparability with other companies in our industry 
gross orders from oncology systems increased and from x ray products increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross orders in vpt decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year when two proton therapy systems orders st 
petersburg in russia and king fahd medical city in saudi arabia totaling approximately million were recorded  compared to no new system orders in fiscal year our backlog adjustments during fiscal year were approximately million 
this amount is higher than typical levels as a result of ongoing uncertainty in the us healthcare environment and higher cancellations of orders  particularly from small freestanding center developers 
this caused us to re evaluate similar transactions and remove orders that were not expected to be converted into revenues 
despite the increase in the backlog adjustments  our backlog at the end of fiscal year was higher than at the end of fiscal year in order to assess how our underlying businesses performed  we also compare the percentage change in revenues and gross orders from one period to another  excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations ie  using constant currency exchange rates 
to present this information on a constant currency basis  we convert current period revenues and gross orders in currencies other than us dollars into us dollars using the comparable prior period s average exchange rate 
during fiscal year  our total revenues increased on a constant currency basis 
we have classified research instruments as a discontinued operation for fiscal year in our consolidated statements of earnings 
there were no operating results of research instruments beyond fiscal year as of september   we had no remaining obligations related to research instruments  which was previously included in the other category 
unless otherwise stated  the discussion in this md a pertains to our continuing operations 
oncology systems 
our largest business segment is oncology systems  which designs  manufactures  sells and services hardware and software products for treating cancer with conventional radiotherapy  including imrt  igrt  and volumetric modulated arc therapy  stereotactic body radiotherapy  stereotactic radiotherapy  stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy 
our primary goal in the oncology systems business is to promote the adoption of more advanced and effective cancer treatments 
in our view  the fundamental market forces that drive long term growth in our oncology systems business are the rise in cancer cases  technology advances and product developments that are leading to improvements in patient care  customer demand for the more advanced and effective cancer treatments that we offer  competitive conditions among hospitals and clinics to offer such advanced treatments  continued improvement in safety and cost efficiency in delivering radiation therapy  and underserved medical needs outside of the united states 
we have recently seen a greater percentage of oncology systems gross orders and revenues coming from emerging markets within our international region  such as china  india and poland and brazil  which typically demand lower priced products compared to developed markets 
we expect that this shift in geographic mix of gross orders and revenues will generally continue and may negatively impact oncology systems gross margin 
in the radiation oncology markets outside of north america  for the shorter term  we expect the market growth of our european region which includes europe  the middle east  india and africa will be mixed  with stronger market growth in eastern europe  the middle east  africa and india  offset by lower market growth in southern europe which is facing severe economic challenges 
our outlook for asia and the rest of world remains robust and  overall  we believe the longer term global radiation oncology market can grow  on average  in the mid single digit range 
oncology systems gross orders increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year with a increase in international orders partially offset by a decrease in orders in north america 
oncology systems gross orders increased on a constant currency basis in fiscal year over fiscal year  reflecting increased gross orders in international region partially offset by a decrease in gross orders in north america 
we believe that the uncertainty in the united states associated with the affordable care act  some consolidation activity among free standing clinics  and more integration of systems and equipment across multi site networks  is resulting in slower capital spending in north america that contributed to the decline in oncology systems gross orders in north america during fiscal year emerging markets within our international region are driving growth  and we received several large orders from customers in these markets during fiscal year oncology systems total revenues increased in fiscal year over oncology systems gross margin in fiscal year decreased percentage points from fiscal year primarily due to the excise tax on sales of medical devices 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year  revenues and cost of revenues of parts that were sold by the service department were classified as product revenues and product cost of revenues  respectively 
revenues and costs of revenues of parts that are sold by the service department have been reclassified from product revenues and product cost of revenues to service revenue and service cost of revenues  respectively  for the first nine months of fiscal year and for fiscal years and to conform to the current presentation 
also  certain other cost of revenue items have been reclassified between product cost of revenues and service cost of revenues for the first nine months of fiscal year and for fiscal years and to conform to the current presentation 
x ray products 
our x ray products business segment designs  manufactures  sells and services x ray imaging components for use in a range of applications  including radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging  mammography  special procedures  computed tomography and industrial applications 
we continue to view the long term fundamental growth driver for this business to be the ongoing success of key x ray imaging oem customers that incorporate our x ray tube products and flat panel detectors into their medical diagnostic  dental  veterinary and industrial imaging systems 
our success in our x ray products business depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets  the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers 
in fiscal year  x ray products gross orders increased and revenues increased over fiscal year x ray products gross margin for fiscal year decreased percentage points over fiscal year  primarily due to price pressure and unfavorable product mix on our flat panel products and higher warranty costs in our x ray tube products 
other 
the other category is comprised of i sip  which designs  manufactures  sells and services linatron x ray accelerators  imaging processing software and image detection products including intellx tm for security and inspection purposes  ii our vpt business  which designs  develops  manufactures  sells and services products and systems for delivering proton therapy treatments  and iii the operations of the gtc  our scientific research facility 
revenues in the other category increased primarily due to increases in vpt and sip revenues 
gross orders in the other category decreased primarily due to no system orders received for vpt in fiscal year compared to orders of million in vpt in fiscal year this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the information contained under item a  risk factors 
we discuss our results of operations below 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies  estimates and assumptions and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include revenue recognition  share based compensation expense  valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of warranty obligations  assessment of loss contingencies  valuation of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans  valuation of derivative instruments and taxes on earnings 
such accounting policies require us to use judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  see item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
judgments as to the allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with gaap 
the allocation of consideration in a multiple element arrangement is affected by the determination of whether any software deliverables that function together with other hardware components to deliver the hardware products essential functionality are considered as non software products for purpose of revenue recognition 
the allocation of consideration to each non software deliverable is based on the assumptions we use to establish its selling price  which are based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence of selling price  if it exists  and if not on estimated selling prices 
in addition  the allocation of consideration to each software deliverable in a multiple element arrangement is affected by our judgment as to whether vsoe of its fair value exists in these arrangements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the amounts allocated to each element could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment  the readiness of customers facilities for installation or is subject to customer acceptance 
if shipments or installations are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
in addition  revenues related to certain highly customized image detection systems  proton therapy systems and proton therapy system commissioning contracts are recognized in accordance with contract accounting 
we recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method which are based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
changes in estimates of total contract revenue  total contract cost or the extent of progress towards completion are recognized in the period in which the changes in estimates are identified 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which the loss is identified 
in circumstances in which the final outcome of a contract cannot be precisely estimated but a loss on the contract is not expected  we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin until more precise estimates can be made 
if and when we can make more precise estimates  revenues and costs of revenues are adjusted in the same period 
because the percentage of completion method involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the dollar amounts to relevant accounting periods  and because the estimates must be periodically reviewed and appropriately adjusted  if our estimates prove to be inaccurate or circumstances change over time  we may be forced to adjust revenues or even record a contract loss in later periods 
share based compensation expense we value our stock options granted and the option component of the shares of vms common stock purchased under the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
we value our performance units using the monte carlo simulation model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant under both the black scholes option pricing model and the monte carlo simulation model is affected by vms s stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions  including the expected terms of share based awards and the expected price volatilities of shares of vms common stock and peer companies that are used to assess certain performance targets over the expected term of the awards  and the dividend yield of vms 
the expected term of our stock options is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and post vesting cancellations of stock options by our employees 
we determine the expected term of stock options based on the demographic grouping of employees and retirement eligibility 
we use a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption for our stock options 
blended volatility represents the weighted average of implied volatility and historical volatility 
implied volatility is derived based on traded options on vms common stock 
implied volatility is weighted in the calculation of blended volatility based on the ratio of the term of the exchange traded options to the expected terms of the employee stock options 
historical volatility represents the remainder of the weighting 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options on vms common stock is reflective of market conditions and is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
in determining the extent of use of implied volatility  we considered i the volume of market activity of traded options  ii the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of stock options granted by us  including the date of grant  iii the similarity of the exercise prices  and iv the length of term of traded options 
after considering the above factors  we determined that we could not rely exclusively on implied volatility based on the fact that the term of vms exchange traded options is less than one year and that it is different from the expected terms of the stock options we grant 
therefore  we believe a combination of the historical volatility over the expected terms of the stock options we grant and the implied volatility of exchange traded options best reflects the expected volatility of vms common stock 
in determining the grant date fair value of our performance units  historical volatilities of shares of vms common stock  as well as the shares of common stock of peer companies  were used to assess certain performance targets 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  as well as the probability that certain performance conditions that affect the vesting of performance units will be achieved  and recognize expense only for those awards expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate and or the actual number of performance units that vest based on achievement of performance conditions are materially different from our estimates  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to authorizing shipment for all major sale transactions 
except for government tenders  group purchases and orders with letters of credit in oncology systems and sip  and orders in our x ray products business  our payment terms usually require payment of a small portion of the total amount due when the customer signs the purchase order  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss to the customer and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively affected 
inventories our inventories include high technology parts and components that are highly specialized in nature and that are subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and on order and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the majority of businesses that we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and  as a result  we have typically allocated a significant portion of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to these intangibles or to goodwill if indicators of impairment exist 
the allocation of the purchase price from business acquisitions to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in addition  the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired businesses to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for those cash flows 
should conditions differ from management s estimates at the time of the acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if we determine that a quantitative analysis is necessary  the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a combination of income and market approaches 
the income approach is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting units and the market approach is based on a market multiple calculated for each business unit based on market data of other companies engaged in similar business 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  if any  consists of a comparison of fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the most recent annual goodwill impairment testing that we performed in fiscal year for each of our four reporting units with goodwill  oncology systems  x ray products  sip and vpt  the fair value of each such reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
warranty obligations we warrant most of our products for a specific period of time  usually months from installation  against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends  if required 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty costs in the future  it would have a negative effect on our operating results 
loss contingencies from time to time  we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings  claims and government inspections or investigations or other legal matters  both inside and outside the united states  arising in the ordinary course of its business or otherwise 
we accrue amounts  to the extent they can be reasonably estimated  that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss 
however  such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
if actual liabilities significantly exceed the estimates made  our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world 
those laws regulate multiple aspects of our operations  including the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous substances 
they impose costs on our operations 
in connection with our past and present operations and facilities  we record environmental remediation liabilities when we conclude that environmental assessments or remediation efforts are probable and we believe we can reasonably estimate the costs of those efforts 
our accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate of the total costs of assessments and remediation and the time period over which we expect to incur those costs 
we review these accrued balances quarterly 
if we were required to increase or decrease the accrued environmental costs in the future  it would adversely or favorably impact our operating results 
defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans we sponsor five defined benefit pension plans in germany where we have two defined benefit pension plans  japan  switzerland and the united kingdom covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements in these countries 
in fiscal year  we terminated one pension plan in germany upon the death of the last participant in the plan 
although we do not have any defined benefit pension plans in the united states  we sponsor a post retirement benefit plan that provides healthcare benefits to certain eligible retirees 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefits are actuarially determined  such as our defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and rate of healthcare cost increases  all of which we determine within certain guidelines 
in addition  we also use assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the expenses and liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience particularly in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses we record 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return on those assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries are based primarily on the yields of a universe of high quality corporate bonds in each applicable country or the spot rate of high quality aa rated corporate bonds  with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations 
a change in the discount rate will cause the present value of benefit obligations to change in the opposite direction 
valuation of derivative instruments we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations on sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies and on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts are derivative instruments and are measured at fair value 
there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note  fair value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are calculated primarily using level inputs  which include currency spot and forward rates  interest rate and credit or non performance risk 
the spot rate for each currency is the same spot rate used for all balance sheet translations at the measurement date and sourced from our major trading banks 
the forward point values for each currency and the london interbank offered rate libor to discount assets and liabilities are interpolated from commonly quoted broker services 
one year credit default swap spreads of the counterparty at the measurement date are used to adjust derivative assets  all of which mature in months or less  for non performance risk 
we are required to adjust derivative liabilities to reflect the potential non performance risk to lenders based on our incremental borrowing rate 
each contract is individually adjusted using the counterparty credit default swap rates for net assets or our borrowing rate for net liabilities 
the use of level inputs in determining fair values requires certain management judgment and subjectivity 
changes to these level inputs could have a material impact on the valuation of our derivative instruments  as well as on our result of operations 
there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value measurement levels during fiscal years  and taxes on earnings we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a two step approach to recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that  based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
recognition  derecognition and measurement are based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the end of the accounting period 
a tax benefit should be recognized in the first period in which it meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  and conversely  a tax benefit previously recognized should be derecognized in the first period in which new information results in a change in judgment in which the position fails to meet the recognition threshold 
a benefit not previously recognized would be recognized when the tax position is effectively settled through examination  negotiation or litigation with tax authorities  or when the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on earnings 
generally  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in the applicable tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax assets 
should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets in these tax jurisdictions  we would increase our valuation allowance and our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination 
our foreign earnings are generally taxed at rates lower than us rates 
our effective tax rate is impacted by existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries do business 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our foreign countries  or a change in the mix of foreign countries among particular tax jurisdictions could increase or decrease our effective tax rate 
our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on certain undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states

oncology systems product revenues increased in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to increases in revenues from sales of our high energy linear accelerators and sales of our software products  as well as revenues from sales of tumor tracking products offered by calypso 
the increases in oncology systems service revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year and in fiscal over fiscal year were primarily driven by increased customer adoption of service contracts as our products become more sophisticated  and by the increased number of customers as the installed base of our products continues to grow 
in fiscal year  the warranty period for truebeam systems delivered in fiscal year started to expire  contributing to an increase in service revenues compared to fiscal year service revenues grew faster than product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year and from fiscal year to fiscal year service revenues also increased as a percentage of total oncology systems revenues in each fiscal year

in fiscal year  the increase in oncology systems international revenues over fiscal year was primarily attributable to increases in revenues from sales of our high energy linear accelerators and service contracts in all international regions 
the us dollar strengthened against the euro and weakened against the japanese yen in fiscal year compared to fiscal year such that the differences in currency exchange rates largely offset each other when oncology systems international revenues were measured in us dollars 
varying cycles of higher and lower revenues between the north american and international regions are impacted by regional influences  which recently have included government economic stimulus programs  the recession and the pace of economic recovery  the european sovereign debt crisis  uncertainty created by healthcare reform such as the excise tax on the sale of most medical devices  medicare reimbursement rates and consolidation of free standing clinics in the united states  and different technology adoption cycles that are consistent with the gross order patterns

additionally  revenues from sales of new products and revenues from sales of image processing tools  which we added to our product line with the acquisition of infimed during the third quarter of fiscal year  also contributed to an increase in x ray products revenues during fiscal year compared fiscal year in north america  the decrease in x ray products revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from sales of our flat panel products  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in revenues from sales of our x ray tube products  which were partially offset by the inclusion in fiscal year of revenues from sales of image processing tools offered by infimed 
in the international region  the increase in x ray products revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenues from sales of our flat panel products in all international regions and increased revenues from sales of our x ray tube products in europe  partially offset by decreased revenues from sales of our x ray tube products in asia and the rest of the world region 
revenues from sales of image processing tools offered by infimed also contributed to the increase in international x ray products revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year the differences in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies between fiscal year and fiscal year  as well as between fiscal year and fiscal year  did not have a material impact on x ray products international revenue growth because sales transactions in the x ray products business are primarily denominated in us dollars

as a result of this reclassification  product and service gross margin for oncology systems and the total company have been recalculated for fiscal years and to conform to the current presentation 
also  certain cost of revenue items have been reclassified between product cost of revenues and service cost of revenues for the first nine months of fiscal year and fiscal years and to conform to the current presentation 
the total company gross margin percentage decreased marginally in fiscal year from fiscal year a decrease in the x ray products gross margin percentage and to a lesser extent a decrease in the oncology systems gross margin percentage was almost offset by an increase in gross margin in the other category 
total product gross margin percentage was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year total service gross margin percentage was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in total company gross margin percentage in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to decreases in oncology systems and sip gross margins  partially offset by an increase in x ray products gross margin 
in addition  total company gross margin percentage was negatively impacted in fiscal years and by the recognition of revenues in vpt relating to the scripps proton therapy center with a zero profit margin 
oncology systems gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the product gross margin 
oncology systems product gross margin percentage decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year due to the new excise tax on medical devices and a significant geographic shift of product revenues away from developed markets to emerging markets  which typically demand lower priced products compared to developed markets 
our oncology systems product gross margin was further impacted by pricing pressure in our international region 
improved installation and warranty as well as product cost reductions in fiscal year from fiscal year partially offset these decreases 
the gross margin for oncology systems includes the impact of the medical device excise tax of approximately million during fiscal year  which is included in the cost of revenues 
oncology systems service gross margin in fiscal year remained consistent with fiscal year at 
increases in service gross margin due to higher service contract volume which lowered the costs per contract and cost control measures in fiscal year were offset by unfavorable product mix and higher service freight charges 
in addition  the us dollar strengthened against the japanese yen in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and has had a negative impact on the oncology systems gross margin 
we believe the shift of oncology systems revenues towards emerging markets  which typically have purchased less complex  lower priced products compared to developed markets  will generally continue and may negatively impact oncology systems gross margin 
oncology systems gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year from fiscal year due to a decrease in product gross margin  partially offset by an increase in service gross margin 
oncology systems product gross margin decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to a geographic shift of product revenues away from developed markets to emerging markets 
our oncology systems product gross margin for fiscal year was further impacted by increased pricing pressure in our international region  particularly in the higher growth emerging markets 
improved installation  warranty and factory costs in fiscal years from fiscal year partially offset these decreases 
oncology systems service gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the increase in service gross margin was primarily due to higher service contract volume which lowered the costs per contract and cost control measures in fiscal year in addition  the us dollar strengthened against the euro and weakened against the japanese yen in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  such that the differences in currency exchange rates largely offset each other when oncology systems gross margin was measured in us dollars 
x ray products gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to price pressure and unfavorable product mix in our flat panel products 
x ray products gross margin increased percentage points in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to improved quality costs for our flat panel products and higher margin products representing a greater proportion of x ray products sales in fiscal year than fiscal year the increase in gross margin percentage in the other category was primarily due to increases in sip product and service gross margin percentages and also an increase in vpt product gross margin percentage 
the increase in sip gross margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to higher margin products representing a greater proportion of sip s sales in fiscal year than fiscal year and also due to an increase in service revenue with higher gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal year the increase in vpt product gross margin percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to vpt recognizing revenue on two new projects in fiscal year using the percentage of completion method and best estimate of gross margin  as compared to the projects in fiscal year and fiscal during which revenues were recognized using the percentage of completion method and zero profit margin 
the decrease in sip gross margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to lower margin products representing a greater proportion of sip s sales in fiscal year than fiscal year research and development fiscal years dollars in millions change change research and development as a percentage of total revenues the million increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increases in expenses of million in oncology systems  million in the other category partially offset by a decrease in expense of million in x ray products 
the million increase in oncology systems was primarily due to expenses relating to new product development projects  including fixed fees accrued as part of the strategic arrangement with siemens 
the increase in expenses of million in the other category was primarily due to expenses relating to new product development projects and a net increase in costs associated with increased headcount to support our growing research activities in vpt 
the million decrease in research and development expenses in x ray products was mainly due to cost control measures 
the million increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increases in expenses of million in oncology systems  million in x ray products and million in the other category 
the increase in oncology systems was primarily due to higher research and development expenses for calypso  partially offset by a million favorable currency translation impact  as foreign currency denominated research and development expenses for oncology systems were translated into us dollars 
the million increase in x ray products was mainly due to higher development expenses for flat panel products  as well as higher research and development expenses for infimed 
the million increase in the other category was primarily due to an increase in expenses for development projects in vpt  partially offset by a decrease in research expenses in sip 
selling  general and administrative fiscal years dollars in millions change change selling  general and administrative as a percentage of total revenues the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to a a million net increase in employee related costs  in part for increased headcount to support our growing business activities  b a million increase in legal expenses relating to litigation matters  c a million increase in restructuring charges  d a million increase in depreciation expense  and e a million increase in risk insurance expense 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities  a million decrease in bad debt expense  and a million increase in income from equity method investment in dpix holding llc 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to a a million net increase in employee related costs  in part for increased headcount to support our growing sales  marketing and other business activities particularly the in international region  b an million increase in bad debt expense to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts related to a limited number of customers  c a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses associated with calypso and infimed  d a million net increase in legal expenses relating to ongoing litigation  e a million decrease in the income recognized on our equity investment in dpix holding llc  and f a million increase in restructuring charge primarily for a workforce reduction in north america that accompanied the realignment of resources to support sales and marketing activities in emerging market countries 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in contingent liability charge in fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest income  net fiscal years dollars in millions change change interest income expense  net the net increases in interest income  net of interest expense  in fiscal year over fiscal year and in fiscal year over fiscal year  were primarily due to increases in interest income generated from our loan to cptc 
these increases were partially offset by increases in interest expense associated with increased borrowing from our credit facilities 
taxes on earnings fiscal years change change effective tax rate the slight increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings  partially offset by a smaller net benefit for discrete items in fiscal year related to the prior period 
these discrete items were primarily related to the release of certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions  including the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions and the favorable resolution of several income tax audits 
in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are  on average  lower than the us federal rate  and our domestic earnings are subject to state income taxes 
we expect our future effective tax rate may fluctuate due to changes in geographic mix of earnings  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws 
for example  recent proposals would make significant changes to us taxation of us based multinational corporations 
although we cannot predict whether or in what form congress would enact any such proposals  legislation of this type could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
we also expect that our effective tax rate may experience may fluctuate from period to period 
see note  taxes on earnings of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net earnings per diluted share fiscal years change change net earnings per diluted share the increase in net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year over fiscal year resulted from an increase in total revenues and a reduction in the number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding due to stock repurchases 
these positive impacts on net earnings per diluted share were partially offset by an excise tax of million on sales of medical devices and restructuring charges of million during fiscal year the increases in net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year over fiscal year resulted from a an increase in total revenues  b a decrease in effective tax rate  and c a reduction in the number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding due to stock repurchases 
these positive impacts on net earnings were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage and a million restructuring charge in fiscal year primarily for a workforce reduction in north america that accompanies the realignment of resources to support sales and marketing activities in emerging markets 
gross orders total gross orders by segment and region fiscal years dollars in millions change change oncology systems north america total international total oncology systems x ray products north america total international total x ray products other total gross orders beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the presentation of reported orders from net orders to gross orders 
we believe this is more consistent with other companies in our industry  will enhance comparability and will better present the orders activity for the period 
for comparability and consistency  prior years presented have been revised to also show orders on a gross basis 
gross orders are defined as the sum of new orders recorded during the period adjusted for any revisions to existing orders during the period 
new orders are recorded for the total contractual amount  excluding certain pass through items  once a written agreement for the delivery of goods or provision of services is in place and  for businesses other than vpt  when shipment of the product or in the case of certain highly customized products in our sip business  construction of the product is expected to occur within two years  so long as any contingencies are deemed perfunctory 
however  we will not record sip orders from governmental agencies with bid protest provisions until the expiration of the bid protest period 
for our vpt business  we record orders when construction of the related proton therapy treatment center is reasonably expected to start within two years  but only if any contingencies are either deemed perfunctory or if the existence and nature of material contingencies is disclosed 
however  we will not record vpt orders if there are major financing contingencies or customer board approval contingencies pending 
we perform a quarterly review to verify that outstanding orders remain valid 
oncology systems gross orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year an increase in oncology systems gross orders in the international region was partially offset by a decrease in gross orders in north america in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in north america  a decrease in gross orders in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to decreases in orders of our high energy linear accelerators and our software products partially offset by an increase in orders for our service contracts 
the increase in international oncology systems gross orders was primarily due to growth in orders for our service contracts in europe and asia  as well as increased orders for our high energy linear accelerators including truebeam in all international regions 
when measured in constant currency  international oncology systems gross orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year both the international region and north america contributed to the growth in oncology systems gross orders in fiscal years and over the respective prior fiscal years 
the growth in north american oncology systems gross orders was primarily due to the continued growth in orders for our service contracts  as well as increased orders for our software products and tumor tracking products offered by calypso  which increases were partially offset by a decrease in orders for our high energy linear accelerators 
the increase in international oncology systems gross orders was primarily due to growth in orders for our service contracts in all international regions  as well as increased orders for our linear accelerators and our software products in asia and europe 
when measured in constant currency  international oncology systems gross orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year the trailing months growth in gross orders for oncology systems at the end of fiscal year and for the three immediately prior fiscal quarters ends were a total increase  with a decrease in north america and a increase for the international region  as of september   a total increase  with a increase in north america and a increase for the international region  as of june   a total increase  with a increase in north america and a increase for the international region  as of march   a total increase  with a increase in north america and a increase for the international region  as of december  consistent with the historical pattern  we expect that oncology systems gross orders will continue to experience regional fluctuations  even with an overall shift of orders towards international regions and emerging markets 
in addition  the availability of government programs that stimulate the purchase of healthcare products could affect the demand for our products from period to period  and could therefore make it difficult to compare our financial results 
x ray products gross orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year x ray products gross orders in north america grew in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the north american gross order increase in fiscal year over fiscal year was attributable to increases in our flat panel products and x ray tube products 
in the international region  x ray products gross orders grew due to growth in both the x ray tube and flat panel products in fiscal year compared to fiscal year within the international region  x ray tube products grew in all regions  with strongest growth in asia in fiscal year over fiscal year within the international region  growth in flat panel products was due to an increase in flat panel orders in asia partially offset by decreases in flat panel products in europe and rest of world region in fiscal year over fiscal year x ray products gross orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year x ray products gross orders in north america were flat in fiscal year compared to fiscal year north american gross order increases in fiscal year over fiscal year attributable to our flat panel products and our image processing tools offered by infimed were offset by a decrease in gross orders for our x ray tube products 
in the international region  the increase in x ray products gross orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increased orders for our flat panel products in all international regions and increased orders for our x ray tube products in europe  as well as orders for image processing tools offered by infimed in europe and asia 
these increases were partially offset by lower orders for our x ray tube products in asia and rest of the world region in fiscal year over fiscal year gross orders in the other category decreased million in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to vpt recording two proton therapy system orders in fiscal year  compared to no proton therapy system order recorded in fiscal year and to a lesser extent a decrease in orders in sip 
gross orders in the other category increased million in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to vpt recording two proton therapy system orders  compared to recording one proton therapy system order in fiscal year in fiscal year  vpt recorded a million order to supply a proton therapy system for a two room proton therapy center at the ptc st 
petersburg center of nuclear medicine of the international institute of biological systems in russia 
in addition  we recorded a million order of which million was allocated to vpt and the remaining amount allocated to oncology systems to supply a proton therapy system and two truebeam linear accelerators for a five room proton therapy center at the king fahd medical city in riyadh  saudi arabia 
in fiscal year  vpt recorded an million order from cptc for the scripps proton therapy center 
the increase in vpt gross orders for fiscal year over fiscal year was partially offset by a decline in sip gross orders 
the decline in sip gross orders was primarily due to sip booking a million one time order from us customs and border protection for five intellx cargo screening systems in fiscal year orders in any period may not be directly correlated to the level of revenues in any particular future quarter or period since the timing of revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders  acceptance schedules and the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products 
moreover  certain types of orders  such as orders for software or newly introduced products in our oncology systems segment  typically take more time from order to completion of installation and acceptance than hardware or older products 
because an order for a proton therapy system can be relatively large  an order in one fiscal period will cause our gross orders to vary significantly  making comparisons between fiscal periods more difficult 
orders and revenues for our sip products have been and may continue to be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place large orders with us or with our oem customers over a short period of time and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter 
furthermore  bid awards in the vpt and sip businesses may be subject to challenge by third parties  which can make these orders more unpredictable than other products 
net orders in the fourth quarter of we changed our primary presentation of orders to gross orders 
the below table for net orders is provided for comparison purposes 
net orders are defined as gross orders less backlog adjustments 
backlog adjustments are comprised of dormancies  cancellations  foreign currency exchange rate and other adjustments 
aged orders that are not expected to be converted to revenues are deemed dormant and are reflected as a reduction in the backlog amounts and net orders in the period identified 
total net orders by segment and region fiscal years dollars in millions change change oncology systems north america total international total oncology systems x ray products north america total international total x ray products other total net orders backlog backlog is the accumulation of all gross orders for which revenues have not been recognized and are still considered valid 
backlog also includes a small portion of billed service contracts that are included in deferred revenue 
including the million vpt backlog  our backlog at september  was billion  which was an increase of over the backlog at september  our oncology systems backlog at september  was higher than the backlog at september   which reflected a increase for the international region and a decrease for north america 
in fiscal years   and  our backlog adjustments were million  million  and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  as a result of ongoing uncertainty in the us healthcare environment and higher cancellations  particularly from small freestanding center developers  we re evaluated similar transactions and removed orders that were not expected to be converted into revenues from our backlog  which resulted in an increase in the backlog adjustments in fiscal year compared to fiscal years and discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we approved a plan to sell research instruments in order to focus our efforts on the development of the proton therapy systems portion of the accel business 
the sale of research instruments was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year research instruments has been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal year the total loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year was million less applicable income tax of zero 
total revenues of research instruments  reported in discontinued operations  for fiscal years was zero 
as of september   we had no remaining obligations related to this discontinued operation 
in fiscal years and  we did not recognize any income or losses and did not have any revenues from discontinued operations 
see note  discontinued operations to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  acquire businesses or make other investments or loans  repurchase shares of vms common stock  and fund continuing operations and capital expenditures 
our sources of cash have included operations  borrowings  stock option exercises and employee stock purchases and interest income 
our cash usage is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
because research instruments cash flows were not material  we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the discussion herein 
cash and cash equivalents the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents in millions september  september  increase cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at september  to  million at september  the increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal year was due primarily to million of cash provided from borrowings under the term loan facility  million of cash generated from operating activities  million of cash provided by stock option exercises and employee stock purchases  and million of cash provided by the excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by aggregate payments of million of cash for the repurchase of shares of vms common stock  million of cash used in net payments under our credit facility  million of cash for purchases of property  plant  and equipment  million of cash used to fund a portion of our loan commitment to cptc for financing the construction and startup operations of the scripps proton therapy center  million used to fund a note receivable  and million used to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements for employees who tendered vms stock upon vesting of restricted common stock and restricted stock units 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate changes in fiscal year increased cash and cash equivalents by million 
at september   we had approximately million  or  of total cash and cash equivalents in the united states 
approximately million  or  of total cash and cash equivalents was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it were repatriated to the united states 
as of september   most of our cash and cash equivalents that were held abroad were in us dollars and were primarily held as bank deposits 
we have used our credit facilities to meet our cash needs from time to time and expect to continue to do so in the future 
borrowings under our credit facilities may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  permitted vms stock repurchases  acquisitions  and other lawful corporate purposes

the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were inventories  deferred revenues and advance payments from customers  accounts receivable  and accrued expenses and other liabilities as follows inventories increased million due to anticipated customer demands for products in fiscal year  mainly in oncology systems and x ray products 
deferred revenue and advance payments from customers increased million due to receipts of down payments for orders for which revenues have not been recognized during fiscal year and due to nature of contracts and timing of customer acceptances 
accounts receivable increased million due to higher revenues and timing of collections 
accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased million due primarily to the timing of payments processed and specifically due to the timing of tax payments both in the united states and internationally 
the million increase in net cash from operating activities during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was driven primarily by an increase of million in net earnings and a net change of million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items  partially offset by a decrease in non cash items of million 
the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were accounts receivable  deferred revenues and advance payments from customers  prepaid expenses and other assets  and inventories as follows accounts receivable increased million due to higher revenues and timing of collections 
deferred revenue and advance payments from customers increased by million due to receipts of down payments for oncology system and vpt orders for which revenues have not been recognized during fiscal year prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by million primarily due to guaranteed prepayments made under a commercial agreement for products that we resell  as well as timing of expense payments 
inventories increased by million due to anticipated customer demands for products in fiscal year mainly in oncology systems and vpt 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  timing of product shipments  product installation or customer acceptance  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments

we expect our capital expenditures  which typically represent construction and or purchases of facilities  manufacturing equipment  office equipment and furniture and fixtures  as well as capitalized costs related to the implementation of software applications  will be approximately of revenues in fiscal year as further described under contractual obligations  we loaned million including accrued interest to cptc as of september   and we expect cptc to continue to draw down the loan facility  under which we have committed to loan up to million to cptc  during the construction and initial operation period of the scripps proton therapy center through fiscal year we had a million credit facility with bank of america  na bofa during fiscal years and the credit facility 
at september   a total of million was outstanding under the credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 
no letters of credit or swing line loans were outstanding at that date 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility for all periods presented within these consolidated financial statements in which it was in existence 
on august   we repaid all outstanding amounts and terminated the credit facility and entered into a five year credit agreement with certain lenders and bofa as administrative agent the credit agreement that provides for i a five year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million the term loan facility and ii a five year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also includes a million sub facility for the issuance of letters of credit and permits swing line loans of up to million 
under the credit agreement  we have the right to make i up to two requests to increase the aggregate commitments under the term loan facility by an aggregate amount for all such requests of up to million and ii up to three requests to increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount for all such requests of up to million  provided that  in each case  the lenders are willing to provide such new or increased commitments and certain other conditions are met 
we may prepay  reduce or terminate the commitments without penalty 
the credit facility contains provisions that limit our ability to pay cash dividends 
a pledge of of the voting shares that we hold in varian medical systems nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary  serves as security for a portion of the credit facility 
these stock pledges also serve as security for all hedging or treasury management obligations entered into by the company with a lender 
as of september   vms had pledged of the voting shares that it holds in varian medical systems nederland holdings bv  a wholly owned subsidiary 
the credit agreement provides that certain material domestic subsidiaries must guarantee the credit facility  subject to certain limitations on the amount secured 
as of september   the credit facility was not guaranteed by any vms subsidiary

at september   borrowings under the term loan facility totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of 
at september   there was no amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at a rate from to based on a leverage ratio 
the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us that are typical for credit facilities of this type  and that are subject to materiality and other qualifications  carve outs  baskets and exceptions 
we have also agreed to maintain certain financial covenants including i a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  involving funded indebtedness and ebitda  and ii a minimum cash flow coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement for all periods in which it was in existence 
in addition  vms s japanese subsidiary vms kk has an unsecured uncommitted credit agreement with sumitomo mitsui banking corporation that enables vms kk to borrow and have outstanding at any given time a maximum of billion japanese yen the sumitomo credit facility 
in march  the sumitomo credit facility was extended 
the sumitomo credit facility will expire on april  borrowings under the sumitomo credit facility accrue interest based on the basic loan rate announced by the bank of japan plus a margin of per annum 
as of september   there was no outstanding balance under the sumitomo credit facility

the following table provides additional information regarding our short term borrowings excluding current maturities of long term debt dollars in millions fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal year amount outstanding at end of period weighted average interest rate at end of period average amount outstanding during period weighted average interest rate during period maximum month end amount outstanding during period our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which result from the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the united states and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate as a result of the shifting influences of these factors  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated from operations and current or future credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next months and into the foreseeable future 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to utilize our available liquidity and cash flows from operations  as well as borrowed funds  to make strategic acquisitions  invest in the growth of our business  invest in advancing our systems and processes  repurchase vms common stock and fund our loan commitment to cptc 
total debt as a percentage of total capital increased to at september  from at september  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at september  from to at september  days sales outstanding trade accounts receivable dso were days at both september  and september  excluding vpt  dso were days at september  compared to days at september  our accounts receivable and dso are impacted by a number of factors  primarily including the timing of product shipments  collections performance  payment terms  the mix of revenues from different regions and the continued sovereign debt and banking crises in europe 
as of september   approximately of our accounts receivable balance was related to customer contracts with remaining terms of more than one year 
stock repurchase program during fiscal years  and  we repurchased  shares   shares  and  shares  respectively  of vms common stock under various authorizations by vms s board of directors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to three primary types of market risks credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk and counterparty risk we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the foreign currency forward contracts used in hedging activities 
these counterparties are large international and regional financial institutions and to date  no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligation to us under such contracts 
we are also exposed to credit loss in the event of default by cptc  the obligor under the loan facility in which we are participating to finance the construction and start up operations of the scripps proton therapy center 
in addition  cash and cash equivalents held with financial institutions may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions 
we also may need to rely on our credit facilities as described below under interest rate risk 
our access to our cash and cash equivalents or ability to borrow could be reduced if one or more financial institutions with which we have deposits or from which we borrow should fail or otherwise be adversely impacted by conditions in the financial or credit markets 
conditions such as those we experienced as a result of the economic downturn of and accompanying contraction in the credit markets heighten these risks 
concerns over continued economic instability  including the sovereign debt and banking crises in europe  could make it more difficult for us to collect outstanding receivables and could adversely impact affect our liquidity 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as a global entity  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
adverse foreign currency rate movements could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases are in europe  asia  australia and canada 
we have many transactions denominated in foreign currencies and address certain of those financial exposures through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s country  and may hedge certain of these larger foreign currency transactions when they are not transacted in the subsidiaries functional currency or in us dollars 
the foreign currency sales transactions that fit our risk management policy criteria are hedged with forward contracts 
we may use other derivative instruments in the future 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts primarily to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the forward contracts range from one to thirteen months in maturity 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional amounts of forward contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
the fair value of forward contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
a move in foreign currency exchange rates would change the fair value of the contracts  and the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would change in a similar offsetting manner 
the notional values and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates of our sold and purchased foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september  were as follows in millions notional value sold notional value purchased weighted average contract rate foreign currency units per usd australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro indian rupee japanese yen norwegian krone swiss franc swedish krone totals interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates depends primarily on our investment portfolio and short term borrowings 
our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents and a short term investment as of september  the principal amount of cash and cash equivalents at september  totaled billion with a weighted average interest rate of 
at september   our short term investment represented a loan of million including accrued interest to cptc  which bears interest at libor plus per annum with a minimum interest rate of per annum 
the credit facility  which includes the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility  allows us to borrow up to a maximum amount of million under the revolving credit facility and million under the term loan facility 
we secured a portion of the credit facility with a pledge of of the voting shares that we hold in varian medical systems nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary 
borrowings under the term loan facility accrue interest either i based on a eurodollar rate  as defined in the credit agreement the eurodollar rate  plus a margin of to based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and ebitda or ii based upon a base rate of a the federal funds rate plus  b bofa s announced prime rate  or c the eurodollar rate plus  whichever is highest  plus a margin of up to based on the same leverage ratio  depending upon instructions from the company 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue interest either i based on the eurodollar rate plus a margin of to based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and ebitda or ii based upon a base rate of a the federal funds rate plus  b bofa s announced prime rate  or c the eurodollar rate plus  whichever is highest  plus a margin of to based on the same leverage ratio  depending upon instructions from the company 
in addition  the sumitomo credit facility allows vms kk to borrow up to a maximum amount of billion japanese yen 
borrowings under the sumitomo credit facility accrue interest based on the basic loan rate announced by the bank of japan plus a margin 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility 
as of september   there was no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at september   borrowings under the term loan facility totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of 
if the amount outstanding under our term loan facility remained at this level for an entire year and interest rates increased or decreased by  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  by an additional million 
see a detailed discussion of our credit facilities in md a liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  we had million of an unsecured term loan outstanding at september  that carried at a weighted average fixed interest rate of with principal payments due in fiscal year to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate of our investment portfolio  short term borrowings or long term debt  but may consider the use of derivative instruments in the future 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  short term borrowings and long term debt 
fiscal years dollars in millions thereafter total assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate short term investment average interest rate liabilities long term debt including current maturities average interest rate represents interest rates effective as of september  represents amount loaned to cptc  including accrued interest  under a loan facility 
see note  variable interest entity of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents of which was held abroad at september  and could be subject to additional taxation if it were repatriated to the united states and the estimated fair value of our unsecured term loan approximated the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our term loan payable in fiscal year  at september   approximates its carrying value because the term loan is carried at a market observable interest rate that resets periodically 
the fair value of our loan to cptc was million at september   which was estimated based on the income approach by using the discounted cash flow model with key assumptions that include discount rates corresponding to the terms and risks associated with the loan to cptc 
in addition  the company does not increase the fair value above its par value as orix  the loan agent  has the option to purchase this loan from the company under the original terms and conditions at par value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
