item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of products for use in the water quality  water safety  water flow control and water conservation markets in both north america and emea with a growing presence in asia 
for over years  we have designed and manufactured products that promote the comfort and safety of people and the quality and conservation of water used in commercial and residential applications 
we earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products 
our principal product lines include residential commercial flow control products includes products typically sold into plumbing and hot water applications such as backflow preventers  water pressure regulators  temperature and pressure relief valves  and thermostatic mixing valves 
hvac gas products includes hydronic and electric heating systems for under floor radiant applications  hydronic pump groups for boiler manufacturers and alternative energy control packages  and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications 
hvac is an acronym for heating  ventilation and air conditioning 
drains water re use products includes drainage products and engineered rain water harvesting solutions for commercial  industrial  marine and residential applications 
water quality products includes point of use and point of entry water filtration  conditioning and scale prevention systems for both commercial and residential applications 
our business is reported in three geographic segments north america  emea and asia 
we distribute our products through three primary distribution channels wholesale  do it yourself diy and original equipment manufacturers oems 
we believe that the factors relating to our future growth include our ability to continue to make selective acquisitions  both in our core markets as well as in new complementary markets  regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water  safe use of water  increased demand for clean water  continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes and a healthy economic environment 
we have completed acquisitions since divesting our industrial and oil and gas business in our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control and related complementary markets 
we target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following an entry into new markets  an increase in shelf space with existing customers  a new or improved technology or an expansion of the breadth of our water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control products for the commercial  industrial and residential markets 
products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement  which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes 
we are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products 
we believe that the product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  represent a competitive advantage for us 
our performance in was mixed  driven by different opportunities and challenges within each region in which we participate 
in north america  we saw sequential quarterly improvement during as the us residential marketplace began to recover 
however  the commercial market continued to lag 
in emea  we experienced pockets of growth in certain pan european product lines  such as specialty drains  and in certain countries  such as germany 
our emea business also further expanded its sales into eastern europe and the middle east 
other parts of europe  such as italy and more recently france  were significantly affected by the general economic downturn 
in asia  we had solid growth as we expanded our sales and marketing efforts 
overall  sales grew organically by as compared to organic sales growth excludes the impacts of acquisitions  divestitures and foreign exchange from year over year comparisons 
we believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis 
organic sales in north america and asia grew by and  respectively  but were substantially offset by a reduction in emea organic sales of operationally  much of the focus in the us in concerned our transition to lead free production 
our operating results were negatively impacted  especially in the first half of as we began the transition process 
the additional costs were driven by preproduction runs  vendor material recertification  increased material costs and some production inefficiencies caused by the transition 
in the first half of  we expect that our us operations may experience incremental costs related to the commissioning of our new lead free foundry  currently scheduled to come on line in the second quarter of the impact of commodity costs during was somewhat muted  especially with our most important raw material  copper 
we saw spot costs increase in the first and third quarters  only to abate somewhat in the second and fourth quarters 
pricing  in turn  was fairly stable  although we experienced some pricing pressures in certain geographies and in certain product lines in north america 
in europe  we were able to selectively increase pricing for certain products 
however  we believe the economic uncertainty in europe may continue affecting how our competitors are pricing in end markets 
we continually review our business and implement restructuring plans as needed 
we recently completed restructuring projects in the us and europe which have shut down and consolidated certain of our operations 
please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of our restructuring activities 
acquisitions and disposals on december   we disposed of the outstanding shares of flomatic corporation flomatic  to a third party in an all cash transaction 
flomatic was acquired as part of the danfoss socla sas socla acquisition in april flomatic specializes in manufacturing various valves for the well water industry  a product line not core to our business 
the operating results of flomatic have been classified in discontinued operations for and a net loss on disposal of approximately million was charged to discontinued operations in on january   we completed the acquisition of tekmar control systems tekmar in a share purchase transaction 
a designer and manufacturer of control systems used in heating  ventilation  and air conditioning applications  tekmar is expected to enhance our hydronic systems product offerings in the us and canada 
the initial purchase price paid was cad million  with an earn out based on future earnings levels being achieved 
the initial purchase price paid was equal to approximately million based on the exchange rate of canadian dollar to us dollars as of january  the total purchase price will not exceed cad million 
recent developments on february   we declared a quarterly dividend of eleven cents per share on each outstanding share of class a common stock and class b common stock

our net sales in each of these segments for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  year ended december  change to consolidated net sales net sales sales net sales sales change dollars in millions north america emea asia total the change in net sales was attributable to the following change as a of consolidated net sales change as a of segment net sales north america emea asia total north america emea asia total north america emea asia dollars in millions organic foreign exchange acquisitions total organic net sales in into the north america wholesale market increased by million  or  compared to minimal increases were noted in our four major product categories ranging from in water quality products to in hvac and gas products 
organic sales into the north american diy market in increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to increased product sales of million in residential and commercial flow control products and million in water quality products 
organic net sales in the emea wholesale market were essentially flat compared to wholesale sales increased million due to stronger plumbing and valves sales into the middle east and eastern europe  and increased drain sales on a pan european basis by million 
however  those gains were offset by wholesale sales reductions of million in italy and million in france  both due to a poor overall economy  and a reduction of pre insulated pipe products sales of million 
organic sales into the oem market in decreased by million  or  compared to the decline was primarily due to decreased sales in the nordic region of million from lower demands by heating pump and electrical heating manufacturers  lower sales in france and italy of million and million  respectively  due to the economic slowdown  and a reduction in our pre insulated piping lines of million 
declines were offset by increased sales of million related to our drains product line 
the net decrease in sales due to foreign exchange was primarily due to the depreciation of the euro and the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
we cannot predict whether these currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales

in north america  gross margin declined due to non commodity cost increases as well as manufacturing inefficiencies driven by pre production costs and outsourcing costs caused by certain us plants transitioning to lead free production 
north america gross margin was also affected by product mix as diy sales grew faster than wholesale sales and there were selective price concessions to meet market competition 
north america gross margin increased during the second half of as lead free related costs abated 
emea gross margin increased as compared to  partially due to acquisition accounting charges of million made in in connection with the socla acquisition and partially due to better product mix and improved pricing in selling  general and administrative expenses

professional service costs increased due to higher legal fees and legal settlement costs  and it and tax related projects undertaken in insurance costs increased due to higher product liability charges in north america 
personnel costs were reduced in primarily due to the separation costs incurred in for the former chief executive officer and lower retirement costs in related to the pension freeze  and depreciation and amortization costs were lower in principally due to the asset write downs taken at austroflex in the decrease in sg a expenses from foreign exchange was primarily due to the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar

as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents 
our ability to fund operations from cash and cash equivalents could be limited by market liquidity as well as possible tax implications of moving proceeds across jurisdictions 
of this amount  approximately million of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries 
our us operations currently generate sufficient cash flows to meet our domestic obligations 
we also have the ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates  utilize the committed funds under our credit agreement or recall intercompany loans 
however  if amounts held by foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund operations in the united states  we could be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds 
such charges may include a federal tax of up to on dividends received in the us  potential state income taxes and an additional withholding tax payable to foreign jurisdictions of up to 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and we do not have any current plans to repatriate them to fund operations in the united states 
covenant compliance under the credit agreement  we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests 
the financial ratios include a consolidated interest coverage ratio based on consolidated earnings before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation  and amortization consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement

we have several note agreements as further detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these note agreements require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rent expense during the period to consolidated fixed charges 
consolidated fixed charges are the sum of consolidated interest expense for the period and consolidated rent expense 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to the credit agreement and had million of unused and available credit under the credit agreement and million of stand by letters of credit outstanding on the credit agreement 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december  in january  a stand by letter of credit was reduced by million 
we generated million of net cash from operating activities of discontinued operations in related primarily to a legal settlement regarding the disposal of a former chinese subsidiary 
we generated million of net cash from investing activities of discontinued operations resulting primarily from proceeds received upon the disposal of flomatic in december working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities as of december  was million compared to million as of december  the decrease was primarily due to a million private placement note payable due in may being classified as a current liability at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of december  compared to to as of december   reduced by the note payable reclassification 
we expect to repay the private placement note with either cash on hand or borrow from our credit facility  or a combination of both 
cash flows in  we generated million of cash from operating activities as compared to million in we generated approximately million of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure  which we reconcile below  defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets  compared to free cash flow of million in free cash flow as a percentage of net income from continuing operations was in as compared to in in  we used million of net cash from investing activities primarily for the purchase of socla and for capital equipment 
in  we used million of net cash from financing activities 
borrowings and repayments primarily related to funds borrowed under our credit agreement for the purchase of socla and then partially repaid 
other cash outflows included million used to repurchase one million shares of class a common stock during and for million of dividend payments 
cash flows in  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
we generated approximately million of free cash flow 
free cash flow as a percentage of net income from continuing operations was in in  we used million of net cash from investing activities primarily for the purchase of austroflex and for capital equipment 
we elected to participate in a settlement offer from ubs  ag ubs for all of our outstanding auction rate securities ars investments 
under the terms of the settlement offer  we were issued rights by ubs entitling the holder to require ubs to purchase the underlying ars at par value during the period from june   through july  we elected to exercise this right in and received million from ubs in settlement of all outstanding ars investments 
in addition  during  we invested in nine month certificates of deposits totaling approximately million 
in  we generated million of net cash from financing activities primarily from issuing million  year private placement notes in june the notes  partially offset by the repayment of million in private placement notes and million of dividend payments 
the notes were issued pursuant to a note purchase agreement the note purchase agreement 
we will pay interest on the outstanding balance of the notes at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually on june and december until the principal on the notes shall become due and payable 
we may  at our option  upon notice  subject to the terms of the note purchase agreement  prepay at any time all or part of the notes in an amount not less than million by paying the principal amount plus a make whole amount as defined in the note purchase agreement

events of defaults under the note purchase agreement include failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants  as well as bankruptcy and other insolvency events 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  then a majority of the note holders have the right to accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding notes under the note purchase agreement 
in limited circumstances  such acceleration is automatic 
non gaap financial measures we believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash  to repay debt and to fund acquisitions 
other companies may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as an indication of our performance 
free cash flow should also not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as defined by gaap 
the cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income from continuing operations is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operations to free cash flow and calculation of our cash conversion rate is provided below years ended december  in millions net cash provided by continuing operations less additions to property  plant  and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment free cash flow net income from continuing operations as reported cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income from continuing operations our net debt to capitalization ratio  a non gaap financial measure used by management  decreased to for from for the decrease in the ratio resulted from cash being generated through operations during  which serves to reduce net debt 
management believes this to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and as a basis to evaluate our financial structure 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define net debt to capitalization differently 
a reconciliation of long term debt including current portion to net debt and our net debt to capitalization ratio is provided below december  in millions current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  net of current portion less cash and cash equivalents net debt a reconciliation of capitalization is provided below december  in millions net debt total stockholders equity capitalization net debt to capitalization ratio contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are presented in the following table payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations  including current maturities a operating lease obligations capital lease obligations a pension contributions interest earnout payments a other b total a as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet b includes commodity and capital commitments  ceo separation costs and other benefits at december  we maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
amounts outstanding were approximately million as of december  and million as of december   respectively 
our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and  to a lesser extent  foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance 
these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down  therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating lease commitments  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
application of critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
there were no changes in our accounting policies or significant changes in our accounting estimates during in  we changed the amortization period of pension gains and losses as discussed below under the caption pension benefits 
we periodically discuss the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with our audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs 
provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale  derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer programs  which are primarily annual volume incentive plans  allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us 
we record estimated reductions to revenue  made at the time of sale  for customer programs based on estimated purchase targets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the development of our allowance for doubtful accounts varies by region but in general is based on a review of past due amounts  historical write off experience  as well as aging trends affecting specific accounts and general operational factors affecting all accounts 
in addition  factors are developed in certain regions utilizing historical trends of sales and returns and allowances and cash discount activities to derive a reserve for returns and allowances and cash discounts 
we uniformly consider current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also aggressively monitor the creditworthiness of our largest customers  and periodically review customer credit limits to reduce risk 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs determined primarily on a first in first out basis 
we utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve 
we identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to four years in sales 
this is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months 
new products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis 
a portion of our products contain recoverable materials  therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
in certain countries  additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process 
the reserve is established based on the prior year inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance 
goodwill and other intangibles we have made numerous acquisitions over the years which included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
we believe this approach yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value as our reporting units are not easily compared to other corporations involved in similar businesses 
revised accounting guidance issued in september allows us to review goodwill for impairment utilizing either qualitative or quantitative analyses 
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then performing the two step quantitative impairment test is unnecessary 
we first identify those reporting units that we believe could pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
for each reporting unit identified  our qualitative analysis includes a review of the most recent fair value calculation to identify the extent of the cushion between fair value and carrying amount  to determine if a substantial cushion existed 
a review of events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent fair value calculation to determine if those events or circumstances would have affected our previous fair value assessment 
items identified and reviewed include macroeconomic conditions  industry and market changes  cost factor changes  events that affect the reporting unit  financial performance against expectations and the reporting unit performance relative to peers 
we then compile this information and make our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine it is not more likely than not  then no further quantitative analysis is required 
we determined we have eight reporting units in continuing operations  one of which  water quality  has no goodwill 
in  we performed a qualitative analysis for the drains and water re use formerly orion  dormont and asia reporting units 
as it was determined  the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value 
the second analysis for goodwill impairment involves a quantitative two step process 
in  we performed a quantitative impairment analysis for residential and commercial  emea  bl cher and brae  including an impairment analysis during the second quarter for the emea reporting unit due to results below expectations 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other market data 
we develop our assumptions based on our historical results including sales growth  operating profits  working capital levels and tax rates 
we believe that the discounted cash flow model is sensitive to the selected discount rate 
we use third party valuation specialists to help develop appropriate discount rates for each reporting unit 
we use standard valuation practices to arrive at a weighted average cost of capital based on the market and guideline public companies 
the higher the discount rate  the lower the discounted cash flows 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
during the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we recognized a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million and million  respectively  related to our brae reporting unit within our north america segment 
the charges were taken as a result of reduced expectations regarding the reporting unit 
as of our october  testing date  we had approximately million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
our impairment testing indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values  thereby resulting in no impairment 
the results of this impairment analysis are summarized in the table below goodwill balance at october  book value of equity of reporting unit at october  estimated fair value implied value of equity at october  in millions reporting unit europe bl cher residential commercial the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment are related to our outlook of the business long term performance  which included key assumptions as to the appropriate discount rate and long term growth rate 
in connection with our october  impairment test  we utilized discount rates ranging from to  growth rates beyond our planning periods ranging from to and long term terminal growth rates from to 
future increases in discount rates due to changing interest rates or a declining economic environment could impact our assumptions and the value of our reporting units 
intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
during  and  we recognized non cash pre tax charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  as an impairment of certain of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
in addition  during  we recognized non cash pretax charges of million as an impairment of certain amortizable intangible assets in our emea segment 
the company determined that the prospects for austroflex  part of our emea segment  were lower than originally estimated due to current operating profits below forecast and tempered future growth expectations 
accordingly  the company performed a fair value assessment and  as a result  wrote down the long lived assets by million  or approximately  including customer relationships of million  trade names of million  and property  plant and equipment of million 
fair value was based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions and utilized an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
revised accounting guidance issued in allows us to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets consistent with the goodwill guidance noted previously 
for our impairment assessment  we performed quantitative assessments for all indefinite lived intangible assets 
the methodology we employed was the relief from royalty method  a subset of the income approach 
that impairment review occurred as of october  product liability and workers compensation costs because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies  we are generally self insured for potential product liability claims and for workers compensation costs associated with workplace accidents 
we are subject to a variety of potential liabilities in connection with product liability cases and we maintain product liability and other insurance coverage  which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices 
for product liability cases in the us  management establishes its product liability accrual by utilizing third party actuarial valuations which incorporates historical trend factors and our specific claims experience derived from loss reports provided by third party administrators 
in other countries  we maintain insurance coverage with relatively high deductible payments  as product liability claims tend to be smaller than those experienced in the us changes in the nature of claims or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of this estimate and require changes to the provisions 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on management estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience  discounted based on risk free interest rates 
we employ third party actuarial valuations to help us estimate our workers compensation accrual 
in other countries where workers compensation costs are applicable  we maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported and is subject to changes in discount rates 
we determine the trend factors for product liability and workers compensation liabilities based on consultation with outside actuaries 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed in more detail in part i  item business product liability  environmental and other litigation matters 
as required by gaap  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
when it is possible to estimate reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued  that estimate is aggregated and disclosed 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters  the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued  if any  and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period 
however  based on information currently known to us  management believes that the ultimate outcome of all legal contingencies  as they are resolved over time  is not likely to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
pension benefits we account for our pension plans in accordance with gaap  which involves recording a liability or asset based on the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows weighted average discount rate this rate is used to estimate the current value of future benefits 
this rate is adjusted based on movement in long term interest rates 
expected long term rate of return on assets this rate is used to estimate future growth in investments and investment earnings 
the expected return is based upon a combination of historical market performance and anticipated future returns for a portfolio reflecting the mix of equity  debt and other investments indicative of our plan assets 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in these assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
on october   our board of directors voted to cease accruals effective december  under both the pension plan and supplemental employees retirement plan 
we recorded a curtailment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in connection with this action 
effective november   we began amortizing the unamortized gains and losses over the remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of our former policy of average remaining service period 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes 
effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes  including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year 
management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material variances from expectations are identified 
we recognize deferred taxes for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued an amendment to the requirements for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount  then performing the impairment test is unnecessary 
we adopted this new standard effective with our annual impairment testing date of october  for the year ending december  the adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  our consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollars  are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the canadian dollar  and the us dollar and the chinese yuan 
our foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
for  we recorded a million loss in other income associated with the change in the fair value of such contracts 
we have historically had a low exposure on the cost of our debt to changes in interest rates 
information about our long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod  cast iron  steel and plastic  which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur
