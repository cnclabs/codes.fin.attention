see note acquisitions in the notes to the financial statements 
first defiance risk management is a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary of the company to insure the company and its subsidiaries against certain risks unique to the operations of the company and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today s insurance marketplace 
first defiance risk management pools resources with several other similar insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves 
first defiance risk management was incorporated on december recent developments impact of legislation over the last four and a half years  congress and the us department of the treasury have enacted legislation and taken actions to address the disruptions in the financial system  declines in the housing market  and the overall regulation of financial institutions and the financial system 
in this regard  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike  including several provisions that profoundly affect the regulation of community banks  thrifts  and bank and thrift holding companies  such as first defiance 
also  the dodd frank act abolished the office of thrift supervision effective july  and transferred its functions to the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  fdic  and federal reserve 
the dodd frank act relaxed rules regarding interstate branching  allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts  changed the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage  imposed new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies  and imposed limits on debit card interchange fees charged by issuer banks commonly known as the durbin amendment 
the dodd frank act also established the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb as an independent bureau within the federal reserve  which has broad authority to regulate consumer financial products and services and entities offering such products and services  including banks 
many of the consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies are now performed by the cfpb 
the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit  savings  and payment services and products 
in this regard  the cfpb has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against  and examine  financial institutions 
state officials also will be authorized to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb 
this bureau also is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations  engage in consumer financial education  track consumer complaints  request data  and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities 
the cfpb also is directed to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive practices and ensure that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services  and that such markets are fair  transparent  and competitive 
although the cfpb has begun to implement its regulatory  supervisory  examination  and enforcement authority  there continues to be significant uncertainty as to how the agency s strategies and priorities will impact first defiance 
the cfpb has indicated that mortgage lending is an area of supervisory focus and that it will concentrate its examination and rulemaking efforts on the variety of mortgage related topics required under the dodd frank act  including steering consumers to less favorable products  discrimination  abusive or unfair lending practices  predatory lending  origination disclosures  minimum mortgage underwriting standards  mortgage loan originator compensation  and servicing practices 
the cfpb recently published several final regulations impacting the mortgage industry  including rules related to ability to pay  mortgage servicing  and mortgage loan originator compensation 
the ability to repay rule makes lenders liable if they fail to assess ability to repay under a prescribed test  but also creates a safe harbor for so called qualified mortgages 
the qualified mortgages standards include a tiered cap structure that places limits on the total amount of certain fees that can be charged on a loan  a cap on debt to income ie  total monthly payments on debt to monthly gross income  exclusion of interest only products  and other requirements 
the debt to income cap does not apply for the first seven years the rule is in effect for loans that are eligible for sale to fannie mae or freddie mac or eligible for government guarantee through the fha or the veterans administration 
failure to comply with the ability to repay rule may result in possible cfpb enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual  class action  and attorney fees damages  all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time 
first defiance s management team is currently assessing the impact of these requirements on our mortgage lending business 
in addition  the federal reserve and other federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a proposed rule under the dodd frank act that would exempt qualified residential mortgages from the securitization risk retention requirements of the dodd frank act 
the final definition of what constitutes a qualified residential mortgage may impact the pricing and depth of the secondary market into which the company may sell mortgages it originates 
at this time  first defiance cannot predict the content of the final cfpb and other federal agency regulations or the impact they might have on first defiance s financial results 
the cfpb s authority over mortgage lending  and its authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators  or to rescind or ignore past regulatory guidance  could increase first defiance s compliance costs and litigation exposure 
first defiance s management team continues to actively monitor the implementation of the dodd frank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and assess its probable impact on the business  financial condition  and results of operations of first defiance 
however  the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on the financial services industry in general  and first defiance in particular  continues to be uncertain 
new proposed capital rules on june   the federal reserve approved proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to first defiance and first federal 
the fdic and the occ subsequently approved these proposed rules on june  the proposed rules implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
basel iii refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision in december  the rules text released in december  and loss absorbency rules issued in january  which include significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements 
the proposed rules received extensive comments during a comment period that ran through october further guidance from the bank regulatory agencies is expected in early the proposed rules include new risk based capital and leverage ratios  which would be phased in from to  and would refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios 
the proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to first defiance and first federal under the proposals would be i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of for all institutions 
the proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements  which must consist entirely of common equity tier capital and would result in the following minimum ratios i a common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of  and iii a total capital ratio of 
the new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in january at of risk weighted assets and would increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in january the federal bank regulatory agencies also proposed revisions to the prompt corrective action framework  which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions  including first federal  if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness 
these revisions would take effect january  under the prompt corrective action requirements  which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer  insured depository institutions would be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of increased from 
the proposed rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk weighted assets  which we would be required to utilize beginning january  the standardized approach proposed rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights  and also addresses i a proposed alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with section a of the dodd frank act  ii revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation  iii rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans  iv revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo style transactions  and v disclosure requirements for top tier banking organizations with billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the advance approach rules that apply to banks with greater than billion in consolidated assets 
based on our current capital composition and levels  management believes it would be in compliance with the requirements as set forth in the proposed rules if they were presently in effect

first federal maintains a problem loan remediation process that focuses on detection and resolution 
first federal maintains a strong process of internal control that subjects the loan portfolio to periodic internal reviews as well as independent third party loan review 
expansion opportunities first defiance believes it is well positioned to take advantage of acquisitions or other business opportunities in its market areas  including fdic assisted transactions 
first defiance believes it has a track record of successfully accomplishing both acquisitions and de novo branching in its market area 
this track record puts the company in a solid position to enter or expand its business

common stock offering during the first quarter of  the company completed an underwritten public common stock offering by issuing  shares of the company s common stock  including  shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option  at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
the net proceeds to the company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were million 
financial condition assets at december  totaled billion compared to billion at december   a decrease of million or 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in assets was due in part to the company s restructure of the balance sheet  which included selling million in securities and paying off million in fhlb advances 
the company continues to deploy lower yielding overnight deposits into securities on the short to intermediate end of the yield curve until loan demand becomes consistent 
securities the securities portfolio decreased million to million at december  the activity in the portfolio included million of purchases  million of amortization and maturities  million of principal pay downs and million of securities being sold

the company also recorded  of other than temporary impairment on one collateralized debt obligation in see note investment securities in the notes to the financial statements for additional information 
loans loans receivable  net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs  increased million to billion at december  for more details on the loan balances  see note loans receivable in the notes to the financial statements 
the majority of first defiance s non residential real estate and commercial loans are to small and mid sized businesses 
the combined commercial  non residential real estate and multi family real estate loan portfolios totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively  and accounted for approximately and of first defiance s loan portfolio at the end of those respective periods 
first defiance believes it has been able to establish itself as a leader in its market area in the commercial and commercial real estate lending area by hiring experienced lenders and providing a high level of customer service to its commercial lending clients 
the one to four family residential portfolio totaled million at december   compared with million at the end of at the end of  those loans comprised of the total loan portfolio  down from at december  construction loans  which include one to four family and commercial real estate properties  increased to million at december  compared to million at december  these loans accounted for approximately and of the total loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
home equity and home improvement loans declined to million at december   from million at the end of at the end of  those loans comprised of the total loan portfolio  down from at december  consumer finance and mobile home loans were just million at december   down from million at the end of these loans comprised just and of the total portfolio at december  and  respectively 
in order to properly assess the collateral dependent loans included in its loan portfolio  the company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans 
the company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new collateral dependent real estate loans  and all renewed collateral dependent real estate loans where significant new money is extended 
the appraisal process is handled by the credit department  which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal 
first defiance s loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account officer in any way in making their determination of value 
first federal generally does not require updated appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower 
when a collateral dependent loan is downgraded to classified status  first federal reviews the most current appraisal on file and if necessary  based on first federal s assessment of the appraisal  such as age  market  etc  first federal will discount this amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors 
this amount may then be discounted further by first federal s estimation of the carrying and selling costs 
in most instances  if the appraisal is more than twelve to fifteen months old  we may require a new appraisal 
finally  first federal assesses whether there is any collateral short fall  taking into consideration guarantor support and liquidity  and determines if a charge off is necessary 
when a collateral dependent loan moves to non performing status  first federal generally gets a new third party appraisal and charges the loan down appropriately based upon the new appraisal and an estimate of costs to liquidate the collateral 
all properties that are moved into the other real estate owned oreo category are supported by current appraisals  and the oreo is carried at the lower of cost or fair value  which is determined based on appraised value less first federal s estimate of the liquidation costs 
first federal does not adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser 
when setting reserves and charge offs on classified loans  appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon first federal s experience with liquidating similar properties 
all loans over days past due and or on non accrual are classified as non performing loans 
non performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the day delinquency occurs 
as stated above  once a collateral dependent loan is identified as non performing  first federal generally gets an appraisal 
appraisals are received within approximately days after they are requested 
the first federal loan loss reserve committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary charge off decisions at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter 
any partially charged off collateral dependent loans are considered non performing  and as such  would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before first federal will consider an upgrade to performing status 
first federal may consider moving the loan to accruing status after approximately six months of satisfactory payment performance 
for loans where first federal determines that an updated appraisal is not necessary  other means are used to verify the value of the real estate  such as recent sales of similar properties on which first federal had loans as well as calls to appraisers  brokers  realtors and investors 
first federal monitors and tracks its loan to value quarterly to determine accuracy and any necessary charge offs 
based on these results  changes may occur in the processes used 
loan modifications constitute a troubled debt restructuring if first federal for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
for loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings  first federal either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan s effective interest rate or it may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
for those loans measured for impairment utilizing the present value of future cash flows method  any discount is carried as a reserve in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
for those loans measured for impairment utilizing the fair value of the collateral  any shortfall is charged off 
as of december  and december   first federal bank had million and million  respectively  of loans that were still performing and which were classified as troubled debt restructurings 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the estimated probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio 
consideration is given to economic conditions  changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower s ability to pay  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non performing loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
in addition to extensive in house loan monitoring procedures  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of all commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships that exceed million of aggregate exposure over a twelve month period 
management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with these types of loans 
the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb incurred credit losses within the existing loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
the allowance for loan loss is made up of two basic components 
the first component is the specific allowance in which the company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual credits that are cash flow dependent  yet there is a discount between the present value of the future cash flows and the carrying value 
this was million at december  the second component is the general reserve 
the general reserve is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolios based on quantitative and qualitative factors 
due to the uncertainty of risks in the loan portfolio  the company s judgment on the amount of the allowance necessary to absorb loans losses is approximate 
due to regulatory guidance  the company no longer carries specific reserves on collateral dependent loans  and instead charges off any shortfall 
first federal analyzes all loans on its classified and special mention lists at least quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower  the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantor in determining the amount of impairment of individual loans and the charge off to be taken 
for purpose of the general reserve analysis  the loan portfolio is stratified into nine different loan pools based on loan type and by market area to allocate historic loss experience 
the loss experience factor applied to the non impaired loan portfolio was based upon historical losses of the most recent weighted rolling eight quarters ending december  the stratification of the loan portfolio resulted in a quantitative general allowance of million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in the quantitative allowance was due to a decrease in the historical loss factors relating to commercial  commercial real estate  residential and consumer loans 
in addition to the quantitative analysis  a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the non impaired loan portfolio for various factors 
the overall qualitative factors are based on nine sub factors 
the nine sub factors have been aggregated into three qualitative factors  economic  environment and risk 
economic changes international  national and local economic business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments 
changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
environment changes in the nature and volume in the loan portfolio 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collect  charge off and recovery practices 
changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process 
changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff 
risk changes in the trends of the volume and severity of delinquent and classified loans  and changes in the volume of non accrual loans  trouble debt restructuring  and other loan modifications 
changes in the political and regulatory environment 
the qualitative analysis at december  indicated a general reserve of million compared with million at december  management reviewed the overall economic  environmental and risk factors and determined that it was appropriate to increase several of these due to the continued uncertainty of the economy and the impact on gdp of the fiscal cliff decisions as well as the impacts of the debt ceiling negotiations 
the fluctuation in unemployment rates in some of the counties we serve also contributed to an increase in the economic factors 
finally the risk profile was increased due to a continued focus by our regulators for stability in the allowance levels 
first defiance s general reserve percentages for main loan segments not otherwise classified ranged from for construction loans to for nonresidential real estate loans 
as a result of the quantitative and qualitative analyses  along with the change in specific reserves  the company s provision for loan losses for was million compared to million for the allowance for loan losses was million at december  and million at december  and represented and of loans  net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs  respectively 
that decrease was mainly the result of higher charge off activity and improvement in overall credit risk profile 
the pace of the decline in real estate values has slowed and in some markets has stabilized 
while some collateral dependent loans no longer have enough collateral value to support the outstanding balance management believes it has processes in place to identify and assess market values 
management has expanded its credit monitoring functions even further beyond its traditionally strong focus 
additional asset review functions and more delinquent loan reporting requirements have been added to assist in this monitoring 
management will continually review credit concentrations by industry and has placed lower limits on lending within certain types of loan categories 
management has also segmented the commercial real estate portfolio to track the general performance of these segments to further refine the predictive process of identifying potential problem loans 
the provision was offset by charge offs of million and recoveries of million resulting in a decrease to the overall allowance for loan loss of million 
in management s opinion  the overall allowance for loan losses of million as of december  is adequate 
management also assesses the value of real estate owned as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate 
in  first defiance recorded real estate owned write downs that totaled  these amounts were included in other non interest expense 
management believes that the values recorded at december  for real estate owned and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets 
total classified loans decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  first defiance s ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared with at december  management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for those loans at december  are appropriate 
at december   first defiance had total non performing assets of million  compared to million at december  non performing assets include loans that are days past due  real estate owned and other assets held for sale 
non performing assets at december  and by category were as follows table nonperforming asset december in thousands non performing loans single family residential   construction non residential and multi family residential real estate  commercial   consumer finance home equity and improvement total non performing loans   real estate owned and repossessed assets   total non performing assets   allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing assets allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans total loans are net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs 
the decrease in non performing loans between december  and december  is primarily in non residential and multi family residential real estate as well as in the commercial loans 
the balance of non residential and multi family residential real estate and commercial non performing loans was million and million higher at december  compared to december   respectively 
approximately million of non performing loans are still considered non performing loans at december  and million of real estate owned at december  were in real estate owned at december  the commercial and non residential real estate and multi family real estate loans that are non performing at december  are comprised of relationships  with relationships making up million of the million total 
by comparison  at december   relationships made up million of commercial and non residential real estate and multi family real estate loans total of million 
non performing loans in the single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate and commercial loan categories represent  and of the total loans in those categories respectively at december  compared to  and respectively for the same categories at december  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate and that the provision for loan losses recorded in is consistent with both charge off experience and the risk inherent in the overall credits in the portfolio 
non performing assets  which include non accrual loans and real estate owned  decreased to million at december  from million at december  first federal s asset review committee meets monthly to review the status of work out strategies for all criticized relationships  which include all non accrual loans 
based on such factors as anticipated collateral values in liquidation scenarios  cash flow projections  assessment of net worth of guarantors and all other factors which may mitigate risk of loss  the asset review committee makes recommendations regarding proposed charge offs which are approved by the senior loan committee or the loan loss reserve committee

loans acquired with impairment certain loans acquired in the combanc  genoa  and pavilion acquisitions had evidence that the credit quality of the loan had deteriorated since its origination and  in management s assessment at the acquisition date  it was probable that first defiance would be unable to collect all contractually required payments due 
in accordance with fasb asc topic subtopic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  these loans were recorded based on management s estimate of the fair value of the loans 
at the acquisition date of january   loans with a contractual receivable of million were acquired from combanc and were deemed impaired

first federal usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan to value is greater than to purchase private mortgage insurance pmi 
management also periodically reviews and monitors the financial viability of its pmi providers 
first federal originates and retains a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios that exceed where pmi is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths 
the loan to value ratios on these loans are generally limited to and exceptions must be approved by first federal s senior loan committee 
management monitors the balance of one to four family residential loans  including home equity loans and committed lines of credit that exceed certain loan to value standards for owner occupied residences  for non owner occupied residences and one to four family construction loans  for developed land and for raw land 
during  management purchased two groups of single family loans to medical professionals that had ltv s greater than 
these loans were primarily variable rate loans originated in ohio in these purchases led to the growth in the high loan to value mortgage pool 
total loans that exceed those standards described above at december  totaled million  compared to million at december  these loans are generally paying as agreed 
first defiance does not make interest only first mortgage residential loans  nor does it have residential mortgage loan products or other consumer products that allow negative amortization 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill at december  was million compared to million at december  no impairment of goodwill was recorded in or core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  during  changes to the core deposit intangibles and other intangibles were due to the recognition of million of amortization expense

those advances have final maturity dates ranging from to in addition  first defiance has one  fixed rate advance with a rate of 
the change in fhlb advances is the result of paying off four putable advances totaling million  three strike rate advances totaling million  and two single maturity fixed rate advances totaling million 
the large pay down in fhlb advances was in large part due to a balance sheet restructure that took place in the fourth quarter of in october  the company executed a balance sheet restructuring strategy to enhance the company s current and future profitability while increasing its capital ratios and protecting the balance sheet against rising rates 
the strategy required taking an after tax loss of approximately  through selling million in securities for a gain of million and paying off million in fhlb advances with a prepayment penalty of million 
the anticipated ongoing positive effects of this strategy include increases the net interest margin and net interest income  improves all capital ratios and increases return on average assets and return on average equity 
at december   first defiance also had million of securities that were sold with agreements to repurchase  compared to million of repurchase funding at december  capital resources total shareholders equity decreased million to million at december  this decrease is primarily the result of the company s early payoff of the capital purchase program funds obtained from the treasury in the amount of million  preferred stock dividends of  and million in common stock dividends

net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as demand for new lending opportunities increased slightly in  the company continued to invest some of its liquidity into investment securities 
this may continue into as management deems it appropriate within its liquidity strategy and consideration of overall loan demand

noninterest income noninterest income increased by million or in to million from million for the year ended december  that followed a decrease of  or in from million in service fees and other charges decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for and million for the decline in income in and mainly related to a new rule issued by the federal reserve board that became effective in the third quarter of as well as changes in customer patterns 
this rule prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines and one time debit card transactions  unless a consumer consents  or opts in  to the overdraft service for those types of transactions 
consumers must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution s overdraft services  including the fees associated with the service  and the consumer s choices 
first federal s overdraft privilege program generally provides for the automatic payment of modest overdraft limits on all accounts deemed to be in good standing when the account is accessed using paper based check processing  a teller withdrawal  a point of sale terminal  an ach transaction  an online banking or voice response transfer  or an atm 
to be in good standing  an account must be brought to a positive balance within a day period and have not excessively used the overdraft privilege program 
overdraft limits are established for all customers without discrimination using a risk assessment approach for each account classification 
the approach includes a systematic review and evaluation of the normal deposit flows made to each account classification to establish reasonable and prudent negative balance limits that would be routinely repaid by normal  expected and reoccurring deposits 
the risk assessment by portfolio approach assumes a minimal degree of undetermined credit risk associated with unidentified individual accounts that are overdrawn for or more days 
consumer accounts overdrawn for more than days are automatically charged off 
fees are charged as a one time fee per occurrence  up to five charges per day  and the fee charged for an item that is paid is equal to the fee charged for a non sufficient fund item that is returned 
overdrawn balances  net of allowance for losses  are reflected as loans on first defiance s balance sheet 
the fees charged for this service are established based both on the return of processing costs plus a profit  and on the level of fees charged by competitors in the company s market area for similar services 
these fees are considered to be compensation for providing a service to the customer and therefore deemed to be noninterest income rather than interest income 
fee income recorded for the years ending december  and related to the overdraft privilege product  net of adjustments to the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts  were million and million  respectively 
accounts charged off are included in noninterest expense 
the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts was  at december  and  at december  noninterest income also includes gains  losses and impairment on investment securities 
in  first defiance realized a million net gain on securities compared to a  net gain in and a  net loss in in  and  first defiance recognized other than temporary impairment otti charges for certain impaired investment securities  where in management s opinion  the value of the investment will not be recovered 
the total otti charges in were  and gains on sale or call of securities were million 
management recorded  of otti on its investment of one trust preferred collateralized debt obligation cdos as a result of management s analysis of the securities 
the company held eight cdos at december  four of those cdos were written down in full prior to january  the remaining four cdos have a total amortized cost of million at december  of these four  two  with a total amortized cost of million  were identified as otti in prior periods 
the final two cdos  with a total amortized cost of million  continue to pay principal and interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the securities and no credit loss impairment has been identified in management s analysis 
therefore  these two cdo investments have not been deemed by management to be otti 
in  the total otti charges in were  and gains on sale or call of securities were  the total otti charges in were  and losses on sale or call of securities were  management recorded  of otti on its investments of three trust preferred collateralized debt obligations cdos and a  write down of its perpetual preferred securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac as a result of management s analysis of the securities 
in  there were securities called or matured and four securities sold  resulting in a net loss of  in october  the company executed a balance sheet restructuring strategy to enhance the company s current and future profitability while increasing its capital ratios and protecting the balance sheet against rising rates 
the strategy required taking an after tax loss of approximately  through selling million in securities for a gain of million and paying off million in fhlb advances with a prepayment penalty of million 
the anticipated ongoing positive effects of this strategy include increases the net interest margin and net interest income  improves all capital ratios and increases return on average assets and return on average equity 
mortgage banking income includes gains from the sale of mortgage loans  fees for servicing mortgage loans for others an offset for amortization of mortgage servicing rights  and adjustments for impairment in the value of mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage banking income totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in from is attributable to a million increase in the gain on sale of loans  offset by a  negative change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and an increase of million in mortgage servicing rights amortization expense 
the negative change of  in servicing rights valuation adjustments was due to an impairment charge of  in compared with an impairment charge of  in the impairment charge is a reflection of the decline in the fair value of certain sectors of the company s portfolio of mortgage servicing rights 
first defiance originated million of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in compared with million in the million decrease in from is attributable to a million decrease in the gain on sale of loans and a  negative change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights which were partially offset by an increase of  in servicing revenue and a decrease of  in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights expense

concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one way a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio  northeast indiana and southeast michigan market areas 
management has also identified lending for income generating rental properties as an industry concentration 
total loans for income generating property totaled million at december   which represents of the company s loan portfolio 
management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated with this type of lending 
loans in this category are generally paying as agreed without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency 
the delinquency rate in this category  which is any loan days or more past due  was at december  there are no other industry concentrations that exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
cash generated from operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  the origination  amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities

for additional information about first defiance and first federal s capital requirements  see note regulatory matters to the consolidated december  financial statements 
critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro economic factors relative to the economy of the united states as a whole and the economy of the northwest ohio  northeast indiana and southeast michigan regions in which the company does business 
factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history  a customer s recent financial performance  an assessment of the value of collateral held  knowledge of the customer s character  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the existence of any customer or industry concentrations  changes in a customer s competitive environment and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations 
economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation  specific plant or business closings in the company s market area  the impact of strikes or other work stoppages  the impact of weather or environmental conditions  especially relative to agricultural borrowers  and other matters that may have an impact on the economy as a whole 
in addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems  management considers its historical losses  the results of independent loan reviews  an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards  and other factors in providing for loan losses that have not been specifically classified 
management believes that the level of its allowance for loan loss is sufficient to cover the estimates loss incurred but not yet recognized on the loan portfolio 
refer to the section titled allowance for loan losses and note  statement of accounting policies for a further description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  which are acquired through loan origination activities 
first defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights 
key assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing  assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages  the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream 
in assessing the value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio  management utilizes a third party that specializes in valuing servicing portfolios 
that third party reviews key assumptions with management prior to completing the valuation 
prepayment speeds are determined based on projected median prepayment speeds for and year mortgage backed securities 
those speeds are then adjusted up or down based on the size of the loan 
the discount rate used in this analysis is the pretax yield generally required by purchasers of bulk servicing rights as of the valuation date 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment 
refer also to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note statement of accounting policies  and note mortgage banking  for a further description of first defiance s valuation process  methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses 
valuation of securities first defiance believes the valuation of certain securities is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
this is pertaining to the company s investment in certain trust preferred debt obligations securities cdos 
as required by fasb asc topic  declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary  are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses 
the amount of other than temporary impairment that does not relate to the credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the fair values of these cdos  which are backed by trust preferred securities issued by banks  thrifts and insurance companies  have a fair value of million as of december  the market for these securities at december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which cdos trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
there are currently very few market participants who are willing and or able to transact for these securities 
the market values for these securities and any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the us treasury are very depressed relative to historical levels 
thus in today s market  a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general versus being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue 
given the conditions in the debt markets today and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets  management has determined the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of determining fair value at december   an income valuation approach technique present value technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than the market approach valuation used at the prior measurement dates and the company s cdos will be classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the measurement date 
the company s cdo valuations were supported by an analysis prepared by an independent third party 
their approach to determining fair value involved several steps detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in the cdo  collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the cdo default  recovery and prepayment amortization probabilities and discounted cash flow modeling 
goodwill first defiance has two reporting units first federal and first insurance 
at december   we had goodwill of million  including million in first federal  representing of total goodwill and million in first insurance  representing of total goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if it is determined that we should do so 
the evaluation for impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no additional testing is required and impairment loss is not recorded 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  further valuation procedures are performed and could result in impairment of goodwill being recorded 
further valuation procedures would include allocating the estimated fair value to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
if the implied value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
if for any future period we determine that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances  we will record a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income  but not our risk based capital ratios 
we have core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions which are subject to amortization 
we determine the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon independent core deposit and customer relationship analyses at the time of the acquisition 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of any identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable had occurred during the years ended december  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  first defiance s net interest income would increase by over the base case scenario 
it should be noted that other areas of first defiance s income statement  such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income 
the majority of first defiance s lending activities are in non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio was million  which was split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than seven years 
first defiance also has significant balances of home equity and improvement loans million at december  of which million fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
approximately million of home equity and improvement loans have fixed rates but the maturities on those loans range from three to five years 
first defiance also has consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  as well as to provide liquidity  first federal sells a majority of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market 
in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
for  this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from basis points to basis points 
the likelihood of a decrease in interest rates as of december  was considered to be remote given the current interest rate levels and therefore was not included in this analysis but management believed it to be prudent to include a down basis point environment 
the results of this analysis are reflected in the following table 
table economic value of equity analysis december  economic value of equity as of economic value of equity present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp december  economic value of equity as of economic value of equity present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience an increase in its economic value of equity 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is relatively low because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented
