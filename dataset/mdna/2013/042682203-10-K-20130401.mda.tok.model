readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth elsewhere in this report 
please see risk factors  above  and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
general we are a defense and security products and services company  engaged in two business areas interactive simulation for military  law enforcement and commercial markets  and batteries and charging systems for the military 
we operate in two business units we develop  manufacture and market advanced high tech multimedia and interactive digital solutions for use of force training and driving training of military  law enforcement  security and other personnel our training and simulation division  and we manufacture and sell lithium and zinc air batteries for defense and security products  including our soldier wearable integrated power equipment system swipes power hubs  and other military applications our battery and power systems division 
between and december  we were also engaged in utilizing advanced engineering concepts to manufacture military and paramilitary armored vehicles  and employing sophisticated lightweight materials to produce aviation armor  through our armor division 
in december  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our armor division in order to focus on the more profitable and growth oriented aspects of our business 
we completed the sale of our armor division in june the discontinuation of the armor division for accounting purposes resulted in a one time  pre tax charge during the fourth quarter of of approximately million  reflecting an impairment of goodwill and intangibles million  an impairment of other long lived assets million  a write off of a joint venture investment  and costs associated with change of control provisions and other non statutory severance expenses 
almost all these charges are non cash impacting items 
in  an additional pre tax adjustment of approximately  was recorded to reflect a loss upon the sale 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts  stock compensation  taxes  inventory  contingencies and deferred warranty revenue  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
a portion of our revenue is derived from license agreements that entail the customization of faac s simulators to the customer s specific requirements 
revenues from initial license fees for such arrangements are recognized in accordance with fasb asc based on the percentage of completion method over the period from signing of the license through to customer acceptance  as such simulators require significant modification or customization that takes time to complete 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement  which corresponds to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
the complexity of the estimation process and the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and specification and testing requirement changes 
we account for our other revenues from ies simulators in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and awards issued to employees in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc under fasb asc  stock based awards to employees are required to be recognized as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected term  which affect the calculated values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations 

table of contents accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters may be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we have provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which includes federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under fasb asc  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses in certain jurisdictions and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
we provide valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets resulting principally from the carryforward of tax losses 
management currently believes that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in the us and israel will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
we do not provide for us federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are re invested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be re invested indefinitely 
we have indefinitely lived intangible assets consisting of trademarks and goodwill 
pursuant to fasb asc  these indefinitely lived intangible assets are not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
however  these assets are tax deductible  and therefore amortized over years for tax purposes 
as such  deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax deductibility of these indefinitely lived intangible assets 
the resulting deferred tax liability  which is expected to continue to increase over time  will have an indefinite life  resulting in what is referred to as a naked tax credit 
this deferred tax liability could remain on our balance sheet indefinitely for continuing operations unless there is an impairment of the related assets for financial reporting purposes  or the business to which those assets relate were to be disposed of 
due to the fact that the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life  it should not be netted against our deferred tax assets which primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards when determining the required valuation allowance 
doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense 
we have adopted the provisions of the fasb asc fasb asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
we must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation 
if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate  the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial statements 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and may be subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 

table of contents inventories our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our revenue forecast  which is also used for our short term manufacturing plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
for fiscal  no significant changes were made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of inventory valuation or the methodology applied 
goodwill as of december   we had recorded goodwill of million subsequent to the goodwill impairment in the amount of million in connection with our decision to reflect the operations of the armor division as discontinued  referred to below 
we allocate goodwill acquired in a business combination to the appropriate reporting unit as of the acquisition date 
currently our reporting units are also our reportable segments and the associated goodwill was determined when the specific businesses in the reportable segments were purchased 
under fasb asc  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests  and tests between annual tests in certain circumstances  based on estimated fair value in accordance with fasb asc  and written down when impaired 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu amends the guidance in accounting standards codification asc under the revised guidance  when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit 
if we determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would not be required 
if we cannot determine on the basis of qualitative factors that goodwill is not impaired  goodwill is then tested for impairment by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for the reportable units 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we may be required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in subsequent periods or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment review using the financial results as of the quarter ended june  along with our forecasted plan developed in the fourth quarter 
we use a june date because this allows us to use internal resources that are available before we start our annual audit process we wait until our june financials were reviewed by our external auditors before we start the actual goodwill impairment analysis 
in both and  we determined  using qualitative factors  that the training and simulation goodwill was not impaired 
in both and  we completed the first step of the quantitative analysis of the goodwill in the battery and power systems reporting unit  in which we computed a fair value of that reporting unit 
because the fair value was greater than the carrying value of the unit at the measurement date  the second step of the quantitative impairment assessment was not required and no goodwill was impaired 
although the valuation for battery and power systems division exceeded the reporting unit s carrying value by  we will continue to monitor the actual results of the reporting unit versus the forecast used for the impairment review and re evaluate the goodwill as required 

table of contents subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment review  in december  in connection with our decision to sell our armor division and to reflect the operations of the armor division as discontinued  we identified an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets identified with the armor division and  as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of although the cumulative carrying value of our reporting units included in continuing operations exceeded our market value as of the impairment review  management nevertheless determined that the fair value of the respective reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values  and therefore  there would be no impairment charges relating to goodwill 
several factors contributed to this determination the long term horizon of the valuation process versus a short term valuation using current market conditions  the valuation by individual business segments versus the market share value based on our company as a whole  the fact that our stock is thinly traded and widely dispersed with minimal institutional ownership  and thus not followed by major market analysts  leading management to conclude that the market in our securities was not acting as an informationally efficient reflection of all known information regarding us  and control premiums reflected in the reporting unit fair values but not in our stock price 
in view of the above factors  management felt that in the current market our stock was undervalued  especially when compared to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying entities 
other intangible assets other intangible assets are amortized to the statement of operations over the period during which benefits are expected to accrue  currently estimated at one to ten years 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results in order to estimate future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record additional impairment charges 
contingencies we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for any contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change due to future developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in the settlement strategy in dealing with any contingencies  which may result in higher net loss 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 

table of contents warranty reserves upon shipment of products to our customers  we defer revenue for the estimated cost to repair or replace products along with the appropriate margin for goods that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically twelve months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the deferred revenue is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty deferred revenue is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
the majority of financial transactions of epsilor is in new israeli shekels nis and a substantial portion of epsilor s costs is incurred in nis 
management believes that the nis is the functional currency of epsilor 
accordingly  the financial statements of epsilor have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
executive summary overview of results of operations we incurred operating losses for the years ended december  and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of products that we manufacture and the services that we provide  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a consistent basis 
a portion of our operating loss during and arose as a result of non cash and impairment charges 
these charges were primarily related to our prior acquisitions  financings and stock based awards to employees 
to the extent that we continue certain of these activities during  we would expect to continue to incur such non cash charges in the future 
acquisitions in acquisition of subsidiaries  part of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition of subsidiaries is recorded based on the estimated expected life of the assets 
accordingly  for a period of time following an acquisition  we incur a non cash charge related to amortization of intangible assets in the amount of a fraction based on the useful life of the intangible assets of the amount recorded as intangible assets 
such amortization charges continued during we are required to review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that an intangible asset has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
in the case of goodwill  the assets recorded as goodwill are not amortized  instead  we are required to perform an annual impairment review 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that goodwill has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
we incurred non cash charges for amortization of intangible assets in and in the amount of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we incurred non cash charges in discontinued operations for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the amount of million during in respect of our armor division 
see critical accounting policies goodwill  above 

table of contents financings and issuances of restricted shares  restricted stock units  options and warrants the non cash charges that relate to our financings occurred in connection with our issuance of convertible debt securities with detachable warrants 
when we issued convertible securities  we recorded a discount representing the value of the detachable warrants and the derivative features of the debt that was amortized ratably over the life of the debenture 
when a debenture is converted  however  the entire remaining unamortized discount was immediately recognized as expense in the quarter in which the debenture was converted 
during and  we recorded credits of approximately zero and  respectively  attributable to debt discount amortization 
during and  we issued restricted shares and restricted stock units to certain of our employees and to our directors 
each restricted stock unit is equal to one share of company stock and is redeemable only for stock 
these shares were issued as stock bonuses or were the required annual grant to directors  and are restricted for a period of up to three years from the date of issuance 
relevant accounting rules provide that the aggregate amount of the difference between the purchase price of the restricted shares or restricted stock units in this case  generally zero and the market price of the shares on the date of grant is taken as a general and administrative expense  amortized over the life of the period of the restriction 
we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in and in the amount of  and  respectively 
during the third quarter of and pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement dated august   we issued and sold to a group of institutional investors senior convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million due august  these notes were convertible at any time prior to august  at a conversion price of per share 
as part of the securities purchase agreement  we issued to the purchasers of our senior convertible notes due august   warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at any time prior to august  at a price of per share 
due to certain exercise price reset provisions  the warrants were accounted for as liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value reflected as financial income or expense amounting to  of income in through the date such warrants expired unexercised 
overview of operating performance and backlog overall  our pre tax loss from continuing operations for was million on revenues of million  compared to a pre tax loss of million on revenues of million during as of december   our overall backlog for continuing operations totaled million 
in our training and simulation division  revenues increased from approximately million in to million in as of december   our backlog for our training and simulation division totaled million 
in our battery and power systems division  revenues increased from approximately million in to approximately million in as of december   our backlog for our battery and power systems division totaled million 
common stock repurchase program in february  we authorized the repurchase in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions of up to million of our common stock 
pursuant to this plan  through december  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for   net of commissions  all of which was purchased after april  at december   we had remaining authorization for the repurchase of up to  in shares of our common stock 
the repurchase program  which expires on august   is subject to the discretion of our management

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
during  we through our subsidiaries recognized revenues as follows training and simulation division faac  ies and rti recognized revenues from the sale of military operations and vehicle simulators  interactive use of force training systems and from the provision of maintenance services in connection with such systems 
battery and power systems division efb and epsilor efl recognized revenues from the sale of batteries  chargers  adapters and power hub products to the military and commercial customers  and under certain development contracts with the us army 
battery and power systems division epsilor efl also recognized revenues from the sale of water activated battery wab lifejacket lights 
revenues for continuing operations for totaled million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors increased revenues from our training and simulation division million more in versus  due primarily to revenue in related to a major new contract vcts 
increased revenues from our battery and power systems division million more in versus  due to an increase of million in us sales of swipes  partially offset by a million decrease in israeli sales 
the table below details the percentage of total recognized revenue by type of arrangement for the years ended december  and year ended december  type of revenue sale of products maintenance and support agreements long term research and development contracts total cost of revenues 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased revenues in our training and simulation division and the higher costs associated with the new vcts contract  as well as increased sales in the us of the swipes system 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue remained essentially flat in our battery and power systems division but increased in our training and simulation division due primarily to the product mix and the vcts contract 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were million  compared to million during  an increase of  or  due primarily to increased spending in the battery and power systems division for continuing research on the swipes system  offset by a small reduction of expenses in the training and simulation division 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses for were million  compared to million in  an increase of  or  due primarily to an increase in the sales force and increases in the demonstration of new products to the military in the battery and power systems division 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million  compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in corporate and division compensation of  and a  reduction in legal expense compared to amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets totaled million in  compared to million in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to decreased charges for fully amortized capitalized software in our training and simulation division 
financial expenses  net 
financial expense totaled  in  compared to financial expense of  in  an increase of  or  due primarily to an increase in corporate interest and bank charges of  along with a  decrease in credits recorded in for warrants 
the expense increase was offset by a foreign currency adjustment of 
income taxes 
with respect to some of our subsidiaries that generated net income during  we were able to offset federal taxes against our accumulated loss carry forward 
we recorded  in tax expense in  compared to million in tax expense in  a decrease of  or  mainly concerning state and local taxes and taxes in israel along with naked credits naked credits occur when deferred tax liabilities that are created by indefinite lived assets such as goodwill cannot be used as a source of taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets 
this amount includes the required adjustment of taxes due to the deduction of goodwill naked credits for us federal taxes  which totaled  and million respectively  in non cash expenses in and net loss 
due to the factors cited above  net loss from continuing operations was reduced to million in from million in  a difference of million 
discontinued operations 
as cited above  we have discontinued our armor division see note d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which generated a net loss of  during  we had incurred additional expenses related to the sale of the armor division 
almost all of these charges are non cash impacting items 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and  in restricted collateral deposits  as compared to december   when we had million in cash and million in restricted collateral deposits 
we also had  in available  unused bank lines of credit with our main bank as of december   under a million credit facility under our faac subsidiary  which is secured by our assets and the assets of our other subsidiaries and guaranteed by us 
effective april   we and faac entered into an agreement with a different primary bank that has provided us with a replacement million credit facility under our faac subsidiary  which is secured by arotech assets and the assets of our other domestic subsidiaries and guaranteed by arotech and our other domestic subsidiaries  at a rate of libor plus basis points 
this credit facility was scheduled to expire may the new credit agreement contains certain covenants  including minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  quarterly maximum increase in net advance to affiliates of less than of ebitda and an annual fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to at the end of and as of the filing date of this report  we met all required current covenants 
in february  to support our growth  our primary bank increased our credit line by  from million to million  and the expiration of the credit line was extended to may  the new credit agreement carries an interest rate of day libor plus basis points and an unused line of credit fee of 
the new credit agreement also contains certain covenants  which are measured on a rolling twelve month basis  limiting the maximum increase in net advance to affiliates to less than of ebitda in and meeting a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to 
table of contents we used available funds in primarily for sales and marketing  continued research and development expenditures  and other working capital needs 
we purchased approximately  of property and equipment during our net property and equipment amounted to million as of december  net cash used in operating activities for and was million and million  respectively  a net change in usage of million 
this difference was due primarily to the increased working capital funding requirements for our major projects at both the simulation and training division vcts and battery and power systems division swipes 
the timing of cash inflows and outflows has impacted us due to the substantial purchases of products to fulfill these contracts 
additionally  the increases in working capital were offset by a decrease in the net loss from continuing operations of million 
net cash used in operating activities has been impacted by a significant increase in unbilled receivables 
net cash provided by used in investing activities for and was  and million  a net change of million 
this difference was due primarily to the release of million in restricted funds due to the completion of a significant contract by the training and simulation division along with a reduction of million in property and equipment purchases 
this was offset by a redemption of available for sale securities of  recorded in net cash provided by financing activities for and was million and million  respectively  a change of million 
this difference was due primarily to changes in short term borrowing under our primary line of credit to support the timing differences associated with our major projects at the training and simulation division and the battery and power systems division 
as of december   we had approximately million in short term bank debt and million in long term debt outstanding for continuing operations  including current maturities  as compared to december   when we had approximately million in short term bank debt and million in long term debt outstanding for continuing operations  including current maturities 
subject to all of the reservations regarding forward looking statements set forth above  we believe that our present cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations and availability under our lines of credit should be sufficient to satisfy our current estimated cash requirements through the remainder of in this connection  we note that from time to time our working capital needs are partially dependent on our subsidiaries lines of credit 
over the long term  we will need to be profitable  at least on a cash flow basis  and maintain that profitability in order to avoid future capital infusions 
additionally  we would need to raise additional capital or sell assets in order to fund any future acquisitions 
effective corporate tax rate we and certain of our subsidiaries incurred net operating losses during the years ended december  and with respect to some of our us subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were able to offset federal taxes against our net operating loss carryforward 
these subsidiaries are  however  subject to state taxes that cannot be offset against our net operating loss carryforward 
we also set up a tax liability for the impact of the deductions taken for goodwill 
as of december   we had a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately million that is available to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances  expiring primarily from through  and foreign net operating and capital loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances
