executive summary korn ferry international referred to herein as the company  korn ferry  or in the first person notations we  our  and us is a premier global provider of talent management solutions that helps clients design strategies to assist clients in building and attracting their talent 
we are the premier provider of executive recruitment  leadership and talent consulting and talent acquisition solutions with the broadest global presence in the recruitment industry 
our services include executive recruitment  consulting and solutions services through leadership talent consulting ltc and recruitment for non executive professionals and recruitment process outsourcing rpo through futurestep 
approximately of the executive recruitment searches we performed in fiscal were for board level  chief executive and other senior executive and general management positions 
our  clients in fiscal included many of the world s largest and most prestigious public and private companies  including approximately of the fortune  middle market and emerging growth companies  as well as government and nonprofit organizations 
we have built strong client loyalty  with of assignments performed during fiscal having been on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted assignments in the previous three fiscal years 
in an effort to maintain our long term strategy of being the leading provider of talent management solutions  our strategic focus for fiscal centers upon enhancing the integration of our multi service strategy

we further plan to explore new products and services  continue to pursue a disciplined acquisition strategy  enhance our technology and processes and aggressively leverage our brand through thought leadership and intellectual capital projects as a means of delivering world class service to our clients 
during fiscal  nearly of our top clients utilized at least two of our service lines 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of minneapolis based pdi ninth house pdi  a leading  globally recognized provider of leadership assessment and development solutions and global novations  llc  global novations a leading provider of diversity and inclusion and leadership development solutions see note acquisitions for additional information regarding acquisitions completed during fiscal 
as a result of the uncertainties and challenges that continue to face the global economy and financial markets  we implemented a restructuring plan in fiscal in order to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
the company also implemented a restructuring plan focused on the integration synergies associated with the current year acquisitions 
in fiscal  the company recorded restructuring charges of million of which million were for severance costs and million in facility costs due to the consolidation and elimination of office space around the world 
as previously announced  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the company disaggregated its previously reported business segment  executive recruitment  into two business segments  executive recruitment and ltc 
the company now operates in three global business segments executive recruitment  ltc and futurestep 
see note business segments  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company s global business segments 
amounts reported for prior periods in this report have been reclassified to conform to the revised global business segments 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the chief operating decision maker s review of fee revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  which is further adjusted to exclude restructuring charges  transaction and integration costs  and certain separation costs adjusted ebitda 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures 
they have limitations as analytical tools  should not be viewed as substitutes for financial information determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap  nor are they necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies 
management believes the presentation of these non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding korn ferry s performance by excluding certain charges and other items that may not be indicative of korn ferry s ongoing operating results 
the use of these non gaap financial measures facilitate comparisons to korn ferry s historical performance 
korn ferry includes these non gaap financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its evaluation of korn ferry s ongoing operations and financial and operational decision making 
the accounting policies for the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  except that the above noted items are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
fee revenue increased million  or decrease excluding fee revenue from the recently acquired pdi and global novations in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  with increases in fee revenue in futurestep and ltc  offset by decreases in fee revenue in all regions of executive recruitment 
during fiscal  we recorded operating income of million with executive recruitment  ltc  and futurestep segments contributing million  million  and million  respectively  offset by corporate expenses of million 
net income for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
adjusted ebitda was million with executive recruitment  ltc  and futurestep segments contributing million  million  and million  respectively  offset by corporate expenses of million 
adjusted ebitda decreased million in fiscal  from adjusted ebitda of million in fiscal our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million  or  to million at april  compared to million at april   mainly due to bonuses earned in fiscal and paid during the first quarter of fiscal and the purchase price paid as a result of the acquisitions of global novations and pdi during fiscal  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities 
as of april   we held marketable securities to settle obligations under our executive capital accumulation plan ecap with a cost value of million and a fair value of million 
our obligations for which these assets were held in trust totaled million as of april  our working capital decreased by million to million in fiscal we believe that cash on hand and funds from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements in the next twelve months 
we had no long term debt or any outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at april  or we are required to maintain million of restricted cash to provide collateral for the standby letters of credit associated with certain lease premises 
as of april  and  we had million and million  respectively  of standby letters of credit issued under our previous credit facility 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our periodic filings requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions and changes in the estimates are reported in current operations as new information is learned or upon the amounts becoming fixed and determinable 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide professional services related to executive recruitment activities and recruitment for non executive professionals  on a retained basis  recruitment process outsourcing and leadership talent consulting services 
for executive recruitment activities and recruitment for non executive professionals we generally recognize revenue in three monthly installments commencing the month of client acceptance as this is the period over which the recruitment services are performed 
fees earned in excess of the initial contract amount are recognized upon completion of the engagement  which reflect the difference between the final actual compensation of the placed executive and the estimate used for purposes of the previous billings 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
in addition to recruitment for non executive professionals  futurestep provides recruitment process outsourcing services and fee revenue is recognized as services are rendered 
fee revenue from ltc services is recognized as services are rendered for consulting engagements and other time based services  measured by total hours incurred to the total estimated hours at completion 
it is possible that updated estimates for the consulting engagement may vary from initial estimates with such updates being recognized in the period of determination 
ltc revenue is also derived from the sale of solution services  which includes revenue from licenses and the sale of products 
revenue from licenses is recognized using a straight line method over the term of the contract generally months  which begins upon execution and is invoiced in the same month 
products sold by the company mainly consist of books covering a variety of topics including performance management  team effectiveness  and coaching and development 
the company recognizes revenue for its products when the product has been sold 
furthermore  a provision for doubtful accounts on recognized revenue is established with a charge to general and administrative expenses based on historical loss experience  assessment of the collectability of specific accounts  as well as expectations of future collections based upon trends and the type of work for which services are rendered 
annual performance related bonuses 
each quarter  management records its best estimate of its annual performance related bonuses  which requires management to  among other things  project annual consultant employees who originate business productivity as measured by engagement fees billed and collected by executive search consultants and revenue for ltc and futurestep consultants  company performance including profitability  competitive forces and future economic conditions impact our results 
at the end of each fiscal year  annual performance related bonuses take into account final individual consultant productivity  company results including profitability  the achievement of strategic objectives and the results of individual performance appraisals  and the current economic landscape 
management takes these factors into consideration  and any changes in the estimate are reported in current operations 
because annual performance based bonuses are communicated and paid only after the company reports its full fiscal year results  actual performance based bonus payments may differ from the prior year s estimate 
such changes in the bonus estimates historically have been immaterial and are recorded in current operations in the period in which they are determined 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our consolidated balance sheet and statement of income 
management engages an independent actuary to periodically review these assumptions in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare valuations are carrying value of receivables  marketable securities  goodwill  intangible assets  fair value of contingent consideration  and recoverability of deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results 
of the assets mentioned above  goodwill is the largest asset requiring a valuation 
fair value of goodwill for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital for market participants 
a market approach  utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction to the extent available  is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit 
the company also reconciles the results of these analyses to its market capitalization 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of january  while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values  if our assumptions are not realized  it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
however  it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
as of our testing date  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and none of the reporting units were considered at risk 
as a result  no impairment charge was recognized 
there was also no indication of impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units may include such items as follows a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate especially in emea  an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree  and volatility in equity and debt markets

we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets

the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the csv on our coli contracts
