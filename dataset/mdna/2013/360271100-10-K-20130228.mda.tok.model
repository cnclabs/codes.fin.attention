overview fulton financial corporation is a financial holding company comprised of six wholly owned banking subsidiaries which provide a full range of retail and commercial financial services in pennsylvania  delaware  maryland  new jersey and virginia 
the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent  or fte as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets  such as loans  investments  lines of business or properties 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  non interest expenses and income taxes 
the following table presents a summary of the corporation s earnings and selected performance ratios net income in thousands diluted net income per common share return on average assets return on average common equity return on average tangible common equity net interest margin efficiency ratio presented on an fte basis  using a federal tax rate and statutory interest expense disallowances 
see also the net interest income section of management s discussion 
net income increased million  or  to million in during  the corporation continued to focus on its relationship banking strategy  built upon a foundation of dedicated people and a commitment to superior customer service 
this focus and general  albeit slow  economic improvement allowed the corporation to make progress on its corporate objectives  which included the following net income per share growth net income per share increased  or  in comparison to this increase was driven largely by a decrease in the provision for credit losses and an increase in mortgage banking income due to higher volumes of residential mortgage loan sales and higher spreads earned on sales  partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and higher non interest expenses 
return on average assets improvement return on average assets improves when net income increases at a higher rate than average assets 
in  return on average assets increased eight basis points  or  in comparison to  due to the increase in net income  which exceeded a increase in average assets 
average asset growth included a increase in investment securities and a increase in loans 
net interest margin management the corporation net interest margin decreased basis points  or  in comparison to prior to  the low interest rate environment had a positive effect on the corporation net interest margin as rates on interest bearing liabilities decreased more quickly than yields on interest earning assets  as the repricing of the loan portfolio lagged the repricing of deposits 
over time  as the low interest rate environment persisted  the downward repricing of interest bearing liabilities slowed as rates approached their implied floors 
in  the decrease in yields on interest earning assets exceeded the decrease in rates in interest bearing liabilities  leading to net interest margin compression for the first time since asset quality improvement overall asset quality improved in with decreases in non performing loans and overall delinquency levels resulting in a decrease in the provision for credit losses of million  or 
prudent capital deployment total shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion  or of total assets  as of december  during  the corporation deployed capital for organic growth  increased its quarterly cash dividend and initiated a common stock repurchase program  resulting in the repurchase of million outstanding shares of common stock through the expiration of the plan on december  in january  the corporation board of directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to eight million shares  or approximately of its outstanding shares  through june  leverage market opportunities during  the corporation added new retail and small business relationships  contributing to strong growth in demand and savings accounts 
the corporation also expanded its branch network through the addition of six new branches 
if economic conditions continue to improve  the corporation believes that it is well positioned for growth 
the challenges facing the corporation in will include achieving quality earning asset growth  effectively managing the net interest margin and controlling the level of non interest expenses in light of increased compliance and regulatory demands 
the corporation anticipates higher loan growth and further improvement in asset quality if the economy continues to expand and consumer and business confidence increases 
the corporation primary focus in will be quality earning asset growth 
in keeping with this focus  the corporation affiliate and departmental business plans will continue to place tactical priority not only on loan growth  which will be critical in mitigating the impact of net interest margin compression  but also on growth in savings and demand deposits and non interest income growth 
critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for a more detailed description of the corporation accounting policies related to each of the critical accounting estimates below see note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the corporation s allowance for credit losses includes specific allowances allocated to impaired loans evaluated for impairment under the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc section  and allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc subtopic management estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio is dependent on the proper application of its methodology for determining its allowance needs 
the most critical judgments inherent in that methodology include the ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner 
for commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans to commercial borrowers  an internal risk rating process is used 
risk ratings are initially assigned to loans by loan officers and are reviewed on a regular basis by credit administration staff 
the corporation loan review officers provide an independent assessment of risk rating accuracy 
ratings change based on the ongoing monitoring procedures performed by credit administration staff  or if specific loan review activities identify a deterioration or an improvement in the loan 
while assigning risk ratings involves judgment  the risk rating process allows management to identify riskier credits in a timely manner and to properly allocate resources to managing troubled accounts 
the corporation does not assign internal risk ratings for residential mortgages  home equity loans  consumer loans  installment loans and lease receivables and construction loans to individuals because these portfolios consist of a larger number of loans with smaller balances 
instead  these portfolios are evaluated for risk through the monitoring of delinquency status 
proper collateral valuation of impaired loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section substantially all of the corporation s impaired loans with balances greater than million are measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan s collateral 
collateral could be in the form of real estate  in the case of impaired commercial mortgages and construction loans  or business assets  such as accounts receivable or inventory  in the case of commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans may also be secured by real property 
for loans secured by real estate  estimated fair values are determined primarily through certified third party appraisals  discounted to arrive at expected sale prices  net of estimated selling costs 
when a real estate secured loan becomes impaired  a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary 
this decision is based on various considerations  including the age of the most recent appraisal  the loan to value ratio based on the original appraisal  the condition of the property  the corporation s experience and knowledge of the market  the purpose of the loan  environmental factors  payment status  the strength of any guarantors  and the existence and age of other indications of value such as broker price opinions  among others 
the corporation generally obtains updated certified third party appraisals for impaired loans secured predominately by real estate every months 
when updated certified appraisals are not obtained for loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section that are secured by real estate  fair values are estimated based on the original appraisal values  as long as the original appraisal indicated a very strong loan to value position and  in the opinion of the corporation internal loan evaluation staff  there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value since the original appraisal was performed 
original appraisals are typically used only when the estimated collateral value  as adjusted appropriately for age of appraisal  results in a current loan to value ratio that is lower than the corporation loan to value requirements for new loans  generally less than 
proper measurement of allowance needs for pools of loans measured for impairment under fasb asc subtopic for loan loss allocation purposes  loans are segmented into pools with similar characteristics 
these pools are by general loan type  or portfolio segments  as presented in the table under the heading  loans  net of unearned income  within note d  loans and allowance for credit losses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on class segments  which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan 
for commercial loans  class segments include loans secured by collateral and unsecured loans 
construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate  loans to commercial borrowers secured by residential real estate and loans to individuals secured by residential real estate 
consumer loan class segments are based on collateral types and include direct consumer installment loans and indirect automobile loans 
commercial loans  commercial mortgages and certain construction loans are further segmented into separate pools based on internally assigned risk ratings 
residential mortgages  home equity loans  consumer loans  and lease receivables are further segmented into separate pools based on delinquency status 
a loss rate is calculated for each pool through a regression analysis based on historical losses as loans migrate through the various risk rating or delinquency categories 
estimated loss rates are based on a probability of default pd and a loss given default lgd 
the loss rate is adjusted to consider qualitative factors  such as economic conditions and trends 
overall assessment of the risk profile of the loan portfolio 
the allocation of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed to evaluate its appropriateness in relation to the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio 
the corporation considers risk factors such as local and national economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  the diversity of borrower industry types  and the composition of the portfolio by loan type 
an unallocated allowance is maintained for factors and conditions that exist at the balance sheet date  but are not specifically identifiable  and to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
for additional details related to the allowance for credit losses  see note d  loans and allowance for credit losses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions is not amortized to expense  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
a quantitative annual impairment test is not required if  based on a qualitative analysis  the corporation determines that the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
reporting unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  selection of comparable market transactions  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an interim impairment test is required 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 
for additional details related to the annual goodwill impairment test  see note f  goodwill and intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income  non deductible expenses and credits 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income 
if any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
recognition and measurement of tax positions is based on management s evaluations of relevant tax code and appropriate industry information about audit proceedings for comparable positions at other organizations 
virtually all of the corporation s unrecognized tax benefits are for positions that are taken on an annual basis on state tax returns 
increases to unrecognized tax benefits will occur as a result of accruing for the nonrecognition of the position for the current year 
decreases will occur as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations for the oldest outstanding year which includes the position or through settlements of positions with the tax authorities 
see also note l  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements fasb asc topic establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three categories from highest to lowest priority level inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  or quoted prices for identical instruments in non active markets 
also includes valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices  such as interest rates or other market corroborated means 
level inputs that are largely unobservable  as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued 
the corporation has categorized all assets and liabilities measured at fair value both on a recurring and nonrecurring basis into the above three levels 
the determination of fair value for assets categorized as level items involves a great deal of subjectivity due to the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  determining when a market is no longer active and placing little or no reliance on distressed market prices requires the use of management s judgment 
the corporation level assets include available for sale debt securities in the form of pooled trust preferred securities  certain single issuer trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and auction rate securities 
the corporation also categorizes impaired loans  net of allowance allocations  other real estate owned oreo and mortgage servicing rights as level assets measured at fair value on a non recurring basis 
the corporation engages third party valuation experts to assist in valuing most available for sale investment securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis which are classified as level or level items 
the pricing data and market quotes the corporation obtains from outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness 
see note r  fair value measurements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by fasb asc topic new accounting standard in february  the fasb issued asc update  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asc update clarifies the requirements for the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into net income in their entirety  companies must disclose the effect of the reclassification on each affected statement of income line item 
for all other reclassifications  companies must cross reference to other required accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap disclosures 
this standards update is effective for the first interim period beginning on or after december  for the corporation  this standards update is effective in connection with its march  interim filing on form q 
the adoption of asc update will not materially impact the corporation financial statements

the increase in interest and noninterest bearing demand and savings personal account balances resulted from a combination of factors  including the corporation promotional efforts  customers migration away from certificates of deposit and increased savings by customers 
the million decrease in time deposits was primarily in accounts with original maturity terms of less than three years million  or and jumbo certificates of deposit million  or 
the decrease in certificates of deposit was primarily due to customers not reinvesting maturing funds in certificates of deposit in the current low interest rate environment and migration to non maturing products

the million  or  increase in federal funds purchased was due to the change in the corporation net funding position  as short term borrowings were used to meet the funding needs caused by an increase in investment securities and loans  in addition to the decrease in total deposits and long term debt 
the million  or  decrease in fhlb advances was a result of fhlb maturities  which were not replaced with new long term borrowings

due to the earnings improvement achieved throughout and the strength of its capital  the corporation increased its dividend to common shareholders to per share in  compared to per share in the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  all of the corporation s bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations 
see also note k  regulatory matters  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the corporation s capital ratios in comparison to regulatory requirements at december regulatory minimum for capital adequacy total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to average assets the basel committee on banking supervision basel is a committee of central banks and bank regulators from major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s regulators with the purpose of ensuring that financial institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
in december  basel released a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulations  referred to as basel iii 
basel iii includes defined minimum capital ratios  which must be met when implementation occurs 
an additional capital conservation buffer will increase the minimum ratios by  when fully phased in 
fully phased in capital standards under basel iii will require banks to maintain more capital than the minimum levels required under current regulatory capital standards 
as basel iii is only a framework  the specific changes in capital requirements are to be determined by each country banking regulators 
in june  us federal banking regulators released two notices of proposed rulemaking nprs that would implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
a third npr related to banks that are internationally active or that are subject to market risk rules is not applicable to the corporation 
the first npr  regulatory capital rules regulatory capital  implementation of basel iii  minimum regulatory capital ratios  capital adequacy  transition provisions  and prompt corrective action  would apply to all depository institutions  bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more  and savings and loan holding companies collectively  banking organizations 
consistent with the international basel framework  this npr would increase the quantity and quality of capital required by proposing a new minimum common equity tier capital ratio of of risk weighted assets and raising the minimum tier capital ratio from to of risk weighted assets  retain the current minimum total capital ratio of of risk weighted assets and the minimum tier leverage capital ratio at of average assets  introduce a capital conservation buffer of above the minimum risk based capital requirements  which must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments  and revise the definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses 
as proposed  this npr would come into effect on january  and the new minimum regulatory capital requirements would be fully phased in on january  however  the final rules have not yet been issued and are not yet applicable to the corporation 
the second npr  regulatory capital rules standardized approach for risk weighted assets  market discipline and disclosure requirements  also would apply to all banking organizations 
this npr would revise and harmonize the rules for calculating risk weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses that have been identified over the past several years 
banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets and off balance sheet exposures riskier items require higher capital cushions and less risky items require smaller capital cushions 
as proposed  this npr would come into effect on january   however  final rules have not been issued 
as of december   the corporation believes its current capital levels would meet the fully phased in minimum capital requirements  including capital conservation buffers  as proposed in the nprs

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  debt security market price risk  foreign currency price risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk  debt security market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s equity investments consisted of million of federal home loan bank fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  million of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions and million of other equity investments 
the equity investments most susceptible to market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million as of december  gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses in this portfolio were approximately million and  respectively  as of december  management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the issuers 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
during  the corporation entered into an agreement with a private investor to purchase approximately of the outstanding common shares in a single financial institution as a passive investment 
as of december   the corporation total investment in the common stock of that financial institution had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million  accounting for approximately of the corporation investments in the common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions 
no other investment within the corporation financial institutions stock portfolio exceeded of the portfolio fair value 
another source of equity market price risk is the corporation s million investment in fhlb stock  which the corporation is required to own in order to borrow funds from the fhlb 
fhlbs obtain funding primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
the us government does not guarantee these obligations  and each of the fhlb banks is  generally  jointly and severally liable for repayment of each other s debt 
the financial stress on the fhlb system appears to be easing and the new york  pittsburgh and atlanta regional banks within the fhlb system  to which the corporation is a member  have resumed redemptions of capital stock 
however  the corporation s fhlb stock and its ability to obtain fhlb funds could be adversely impacted if the financial health of the fhlb system worsens 
in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services income may be impacted by fluctuations in the equity markets 
a portion of this revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios  many of which include equity investments 
if the values of those investment portfolios decrease  whether due to factors influencing us securities markets in general or otherwise  the corporation s revenue would be negatively impacted 
in addition  the corporation s ability to sell its brokerage services in the future will be dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in financial markets 
debt security market price risk debt security market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of debt securities  unrelated to interest rate changes  could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s debt security investments consist primarily of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  state and municipal securities  us government sponsored agency securities  us government debt securities  auction rate securities and corporate debt securities 
all of the corporation investments in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have principal payments that are guaranteed by us government sponsored agencies 
municipal securities as of december   the corporation had million of municipal securities issued by various municipalities in its investment portfolio 
ongoing uncertainty with respect to the financial viability of municipal issuers places much greater emphasis on the underlying strength of issuers 
continued pressure on local tax revenues of issuers due to adverse economic conditions could also have an adverse impact on the underlying strength of issuers 
the corporation evaluates existing and potential holdings primarily on the creditworthiness of the issuing municipality and then  to a lesser extent  on the underlying credit enhancement 
municipal securities can be supported by the general obligation of the issuing municipality  meaning they can be repaid by any means available to the issuing municipality 
as of december   approximately of municipal securities were supported by the general obligation of corresponding municipalities 
approximately of these securities were school district issuances  which are also supported by the respective states of the issuing municipalities 
auction rate securities as of december   the corporation s investments in student loan auction rate securities  also known as auction rate certificates arcs  had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
arcs are long term securities that were structured to allow their sale in periodic auctions  resulting in both the treatment of arcs as short term instruments in normal market conditions and fair values that could be derived based on periodic auction prices 
however  beginning in  market auctions for these securities began to fail due to an insufficient number of buyers  resulting in an illiquid market 
this illiquidity has resulted in recent market prices that represent forced liquidations or distressed sales and do not provide an accurate basis for fair value 
therefore  as of december   the fair values of the arcs were derived using significant unobservable inputs based on an expected cash flows model which produced fair values which were materially different from those that would be expected from settlement of these investments in the illiquid market that presently exists 
the expected cash flow model  prepared by a third party valuation expert  produced fair values which assumed a return to market liquidity sometime within the next five years 
expected cash flows models performed prior to june assumed a return to market liquidity sometime within the next three years 
the three year expected term was based on the corporation assumption that market liquidity would resume  in some form  within a relatively short period of time 
although there has been a significant reduction in the corporation outstanding arcs due to redemptions in and  a more protracted period of sporadic trust refinancing and periodic tenders of bonds is expected 
the corporation believes that the trusts underlying the arcs will self liquidate as student loans are repaid 
the credit quality of the underlying debt associated with the arcs is also a factor in the determination of their estimated fair value 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the arcs were rated above investment grade  with approximately million  or  aaa rated and million  or  aa rated 
approximately million  or  of arcs were either not rated or rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency 
of this amount  approximately million  or  of the loans underlying these arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
in total  approximately million  or  of the loans underlying the arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
at december   all arcs were current and making scheduled interest payments 
during  arcs with a par value of million were called by their issuers at par value 
during the year ended december   the corporation recorded  of other than temporary impairment charges for two individual arcs from the same issuer based on an expected cash flow model 
as of december   after other than temporary impairment charges  the two other than temporarily impaired arcs had a cost basis of million and a fair value of  these other than temporarily impaired arcs have principal payments supported by non guaranteed private student loans  as opposed to federally guaranteed student loans 
in addition  the student loans underlying these other than temporarily impaired arcs had actual defaults of approximately  resulting in an erosion of parity levels  or the ratio of total underlying arc collateral to total bond values  to approximately as of december  additional impairment charges for arcs may be necessary depending upon the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
corporate debt securities the corporation holds corporate debt securities in the form of pooled trust preferred securities  single issuer trust preferred securities and subordinated debt issued by financial institutions  as presented in the following table as of december  amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands single issuer trust preferred securities subordinated debt pooled trust preferred securities corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions the fair values for pooled trust preferred securities and certain single issuer trust preferred securities were based on quotes provided by third party brokers who determined fair values based predominantly on internal valuation models which were not indicative prices or binding offers 
the corporation s investments in single issuer trust preferred securities had an unrealized loss of million as of december  the corporation did not record any other than temporary impairment charges for single issuer trust preferred securities in  or the corporation held eight single issuer trust preferred securities that were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december  the majority of the single issuer trust preferred securities rated below investment grade were rated bb or ba 
single issuer trust preferred securities with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december  were not rated by any ratings agency 
the corporation held ten pooled trust preferred securities as of december  nine of these securities  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million  were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with ratings ranging from c to ca 
for each of the nine pooled trust preferred securities rated below investment grade  the class of securities held by the corporation was below the most senior tranche  with the corporation s interests being subordinate to other investors in the pool 
the amortized cost of pooled trust preferred securities is the purchase price of the securities  net of cumulative credit related other than temporary impairment charges  determined using an expected cash flow model 
the most significant input to the expected cash flow model is the expected payment deferral rate for each pooled trust preferred security 
the corporation evaluates the financial metrics  such as capital ratios and non performing asset ratios  of the individual financial institution issuers that comprise each pooled trust preferred security to estimate its expected deferral rate 
during  the corporation recorded  of other than temporary impairment charges for pooled trust preferred securities 
additional impairment charges for corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions may be necessary in the future depending upon the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation

interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a regular basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments and through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short term and long term needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide details related to the corporation s sources and uses of cash 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income  as adjusted for non cash charges  most notably the provision for credit losses 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in due mainly to a net increase in loans 
financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in due to a decrease in time deposits  repayments of long term debt  dividends paid on common shares outstanding and acquisitions of treasury stock exceeding cash inflows from a net increase in demand and savings deposits and short term borrowings 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the corporation meets its cash needs through dividends and loans from subsidiary banks  and through external borrowings  if necessary 
management continuously monitors the liquidity and capital needs of the corporation at the parent company level and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to meet regulatory capital requirements and to meet its cash needs 
as of december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  deposits in other financial institutions  federal funds sold  loans held for sale and securities available for sale totaled billion  or of total assets  as compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  the following table presents the expected maturities of available for sale investment securities  at estimated fair value  as of december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal auction rate securities corporate debt securities total collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities includes small business administration securities  whose maturities are dependent upon prepayments on the underlying loans

weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of and statutory interest expense disallowances 
maturities of auction rate securities are based on contractual maturities 
maturities for mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balances and weighted average rates are shown in one period 
the corporation weighted average yield on its  of held to maturity mortgage backed securities outstanding as of december  was 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase

contractual maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding as of december  were as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total the corporation maintains liquidity sources in the form of core demand and savings deposits  time deposits in various denominations  including jumbo time deposits  repurchase agreements and short term promissory notes 
the corporation can access additional liquidity from these sources  if necessary  by increasing interest rates 
borrowing availability with the fhlb and federal reserve bank  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
as of december   the corporation had million of term advances outstanding from the fhlb with an additional borrowing capacity of approximately billion under these facilities 
as of december   the corporation had aggregate availability under federal funds lines of billion  with million outstanding 
a combination of commercial real estate loans  commercial loans and securities are pledged to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia to provide access to federal reserve bank discount window borrowings

the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flow periods 
included within the billion of floating rate loans above are billion of loans  or of the total  that float with the prime interest rate  billion  or  of loans which float with other interest rates  primarily the london interbank offered rate libor  and billion  or  of adjustable rate loans 
the billion of adjustable rate loans include loans that are fixed rate instruments for a certain period of time  and then convert to floating rates 
the following table presents the percentage of adjustable rate loans  at december   stratified by the period until their next repricing fixed rate term percent of total adjustable rate loans one year two years three years four years five years greater than five years as of december   approximately billion of loans had interest rate floors  with approximately billion priced at their interest rate floor 
of this total  approximately billion are scheduled to reprice during the next twelve months 
the weighted average interest rate increase that would be necessary for these loans to begin repricing to higher rates was approximately 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of the corporation interest rate risk  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rates 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having no contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl to a range of to 
as of december   the cumulative six month ratio of rsa rsl was 
simulation of net interest income and net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to interest rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income  in a non parallel instantaneous shock  to of the base case net interest income for a basis point shock  for a basis point shock and for a basis point shock 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve 
the shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and or volumes in the balance sheet  nor do they account for competitive pricing over the forward month period 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current level of interest rates  the and basis point downward shock scenarios are not shown rate shock annual change in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million these results include the effect of implicit and explicit floors that limit further reduction in interest rates 
economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
for a non parallel instantaneous shock  the policy limit for economic value of equity at risk for every basis point shock movement is of the economic value of equity 
as of december   the corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits for every basis point shock
