item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of key factors  drivers and risks regarding the company and the building wire industry 
executive overview encore wire sells a commodity product in a highly competitive market 
management strongly believes that the historical strength of the company s growth and earnings is attributable to the following main factors industry leading order fill rates and responsive customer service 
product innovations and product line expansions based on listening to and understanding customer needs 
low cost manufacturing operations  resulting from a state of the art manufacturing complex 
low distribution and freight costs due in large part to the one campus business model 
a focused management team leading an incentivized work force 
low general and administrative overhead costs 
a team of experienced independent manufacturers representatives with strong customer relationships across the united states 
these factors  and others  have allowed encore wire to grow from a startup in to what management believes is one of the largest copper electric building wire companies in the united states of america 
encore has built a loyal following of customers throughout the united states 
these customers have developed a brand preference for encore wire in a commodity product line  due to the reasons noted above  among others 
the company prides itself on striving to grow sales by expanding its product offerings where profit margins are acceptable 
senior management monitors gross margins daily  frequently extending down to the individual order level 
management strongly believes that this hands on focused approach to the building wire business has produced success thus far and will lead to continued success 
the construction and remodeling industries drive demand for building wire 
housing construction activity in the united states declined significantly in and continued its downward trend through  improving slightly in and nationally  commercial construction had been strong through  but slowed significantly in  and continued downward through the company s unit sales volume  as measured in pounds of copper wire sold  declined in versus and declined another in versus in  the company s unit sales volume increased compared to in  copper unit sales declined versus total unit sales including pounds of aluminum wire sold increased in versus  as the company continued to expand its building wire product line as discussed throughout this report 
the company believes that the overall decline of unit volumes sold since is primarily the result of the slowdown in construction throughout the united states 
the company also believes that the reduced percentage decline in the company s unit sales volume in and the increase in was caused  in part  by the exit of a former competitor from the industry in the first quarter of according to various industry and national economic forecasts the future is unclear for the next few years 
the credit crisis and the resulting tightening of credit could continue to negatively impact the availability of capital to fund construction projects for some time to come 
data on remodeling is not as readily available  however  remodeling activity historically trends up when new construction slows down 

table of contents general the company s operating results in any given time period are driven by several key factors  including the volume of product produced and shipped  the cost of copper and other raw materials  the competitive pricing environment in the wire industry and the resulting influence on gross margins and the efficiency with which the company s plants operate during the period  among others 
price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense  and the company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices 
copper  a commodity product  is the principal raw material used by the company in manufacturing its products 
copper accounted for approximately  and of the company s cost of goods sold during fiscal  and  respectively 
the price of copper fluctuates  depending on general economic conditions and in relation to supply and demand and other factors  which causes monthly variations in the cost of copper purchased by the company 
additionally  the sec has recently issued an order amending a rule to allow shares of a physically backed copper exchange traded fund etf to be listed and publicly traded 
such fund and other copper etfs like it hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares 
the acquisition of copper cathode by copper etfs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the united states  which could materially increase the company s cost of copper 
in addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages  we believe that etfs and similar copper backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper 
the company cannot predict copper prices in the future or the effect of fluctuations in the cost of copper on the company s future operating results 
wire prices can  and frequently do change on a daily basis 
this competitive pricing market for wire does not always mirror changes in copper prices  making margins highly volatile 
with the company s expansion into aluminum conductors in some of its building wire products  aluminum will slowly grow its percentage share of the raw materials cost for the company 
the company built a plant to expand the production of aluminum building wire as previously announced 
the building was completed in mid  while the installation of all the machinery and equipment was ongoing as of december  production will ramp up considerably in the first quarter of  and the plant should be fully operational by mid year 
in  aluminum wire sales constituted less than of total net sales 
historically  the cost of aluminum has been much less than copper and also less volatile 
with the volatility of both raw material prices and wire prices in the company s end market  hedging raw materials can be risky 
historically  the company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases
