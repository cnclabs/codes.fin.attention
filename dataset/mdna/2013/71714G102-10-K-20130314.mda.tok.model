item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  which present our results of operations for the years ended december  and as well as our financial positions at december  and  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biodefense company engaged in the development and commercialization of next generation medical countermeasures against biological and chemical threats 
our current biodefense portfolio includes the following product candidates sparvax  a next generation recombinant protective antigen rpa anthrax vaccine  rbche recombinant butyrylcholinesterase bioscavanger  a medical countermeasure for nerve agent poisoning by organophosphorous compounds  including nerve gases and pesticides  and valortim  a fully human monoclonal antibody for the prevention and treatment of anthrax infection 
in addition  we were awarded by the delaware court of chancery in september the right to receive of all net profits as defined in the court s final judgment related to the sale of siga technologies  inc s siga arestvyr and related products for years following initial commercial sale of the drug once siga earns million in net profits from sales of arestvyr and related products 
in may  the court issued its final judgment 
siga has appealed aspects of the decision to the delaware supreme court 
in response  we have cross appealed other aspects of the decision 
in january  the delaware supreme court heard oral argument in the case 
we can provide no assurances that siga will not prevail on its appeal  that we will be successful in our appeal  or that the delaware supreme court will not overturn the trial court s decision 
if the delaware supreme court rules in favor of siga  our award can be modified  reduced or reversed completely 
as a result  we may lose all of our rights  we may incur additional expense or our ability to recover any amounts could be delayed further 
critical accounting policies a summary of our critical accounting policies  including those that require the use of significant estimates and judgment  follows 
a more comprehensive description of all of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue from different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  cost reimbursable grants and fixed price contracts 
revenues on cost plus fee contracts are recognized in an amount equal to the costs incurred during the period plus an estimate of the applicable fee earned 
the estimate of the applicable fee earned is determined by reference to the contract if the contract defines the fee in terms of risk based milestones and specifies the fees to be earned upon the completion of each milestone  then the fee is recognized when the related milestones are earned  as further described below  otherwise  we estimate the fee earned in a given period by using a proportional performance method based on costs incurred during the period as compared to total estimated project costs and application of the resulting fraction to the total project fee specified in the contract 
when we use the milestone method of revenue recognition  milestone payments including milestone payments for fees contained in research and development arrangements are recognized as revenue when i the milestones are achieved  ii no further performance obligations with respect to the milestone exist  iii collection is reasonably assured  and iv substantive effort was necessary to achieve the milestone 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met it is commensurate with either our performance to meet the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  it relates solely to past performance  the value of the milestone is reasonable relative to all the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement 
if a milestone is deemed not to be substantive  the company recognizes the portion of the milestone payment as revenue that correlates to work already performed  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue as the company completes its performance obligations 
revenue on fixed price contracts without substantive milestones as described above is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as the contract progresses generally related to the costs incurred in providing the services required under the contract 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on the ability to make reasonable dependable estimates and the fact that circumstances may necessitate frequent revision of estimates does not indicate that the estimates are unreliable for the purpose for which they are used 
as a result of our revenue recognition policies and the billing provisions contained in our contracts  the timing of customer billings may differ from the timing of recognizing revenue 
amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we recorded approximately million and million as deferred revenue as of december  and  respectively 
amounts recognized as revenue in excess of amounts billed to customers are reflected on the balance sheet as unbilled accounts receivable 
we analyze each cost reimbursable grant to determine whether we should report such reimbursements as revenue or as an offset to our expenses incurred 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded approximately million  million and million  respectively  of costs reimbursed by the government as an offset to research and development expenses 
included in the grants was approximately million in therapeutic discovery tax grants which was offset against research and development expense in research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred  advance payments are deferred and expensed as performance occurs 
research and development costs include salaries  facilities expense  overhead expenses  material and supplies  pre clinical expense  clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses  share based compensation expense  contract services and other outside services 
share based payments we have a long term incentive compensation plan the ltip under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the quoted market value on the date of grant 
the ltip also provides for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights  restricted or unrestricted stock awards  stock equivalent units or performance based stock awards 
we account for share based awards to employees and non employee directors at fair value 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the expected term of the option and the anticipated volatility of the option 
intangible assets and goodwill we continually assess the realizability and recoverability of our intangible assets and goodwill 
these assessments contain substantial judgment in determining the fair value of such assets and with respect to future usage of the assets and potential cash flows associated with them 
financial instruments our financial instruments  and or embedded features contained in those instruments  often are classified as derivative liabilities and are recorded at their fair values 
the determination of fair value of these instrument and features requires estimates and judgments 
some of our stock purchase warrants are considered to be derivative liabilities due to the presence of net settlement features  the fair value of our warrants is determined based on the black scholes option pricing model 
use of the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of unobservable inputs such as the expected term  anticipated volatility and expected dividends 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december  revenue we recognized revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our revenue in was derived from contracts with the us government for the development of our product candidates 
year ended december  revenue in millions change sparvax rbche aes rbche protexia valortim total revenue our revenue changed in from primarily due to the following under our contract for the development of sparvax  we recognized approximately million of revenue in  an increase of million or from during  revenue for the company sparvax program was primarily attributable to completion of final drug product fdp manufacture  the initiation of bulk drug substance bds process characterization  progression in the development of bioanalytical and analytical assays  the execution of non clinical activities and the achievement of several contract milestones 
during  revenue was primarily attributable to activities related to the manufacturing platform for sparvax and additional work performed to develop and qualify analytical and stability indicating assays for characterization of the product 
milestone revenue for the achievement of key technical milestones was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in august  we received notification from the fda that our sparvax rpa anthrax vaccine program was placed on clinical hold 
the fda has requested additional stability data and information related to the stability indicating assays 
we have provided some supporting data and information to the fda and have commenced discussions with that agency as well as our customer  barda  regarding the clinical hold 
we cannot be certain that the fda will find our current data to be satisfactory and it is unclear at this point when or if we will be able to commence the planned phase ii human clinical trial with sparvax 
consequently  revenues we recognize in future periods under our sparvax contract will not include those related to this clinical trial until such time  if ever  as we are able to move forward with the clinical trial and overall sparvax revenues until such time will be substantially less than they otherwise would have been had we commenced the clinical trial as planned 
it is also unclear whether or to what extent the clinical hold will affect future government funding for our sparvax program 
under our contract with the department of defense dod for the development of an advanced expression system aes for rbche  our second generation rbche bioscavanger  we recognized approximately million  representing an increase of approximately million or from significant technical progress was made in the development of our second generation rbche bioscavanger in  including the establishment of final clones  genetic stability and fed batch evaluation to establish the bioreactor conditions for manufacturing 
on july   the dod exercised a million option to continue to fund work under this contract in under our niaid contracts for the advanced development of valortim  we recognized million of revenue in  a substantial decrease of million or from levels as a result of our contract with niaid for valortim ending in accordance with its terms in the first quarter additional government funding has not been awarded for valortim 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining additional financial support for this program 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses resulted from research and development activities related to sparvax  rbche bioscavanger and valortim 
research and development expenses include direct expenses salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies  contract research  consulting and clinical development costs and an allocation of indirect expenses 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were attributable to research programs as follows year ended december  in millions change anthrax therapeutic and vaccines chemical nerve agent bioscavenger internal research and development total research and development expenses research and development expenses for both and were net of cost reimbursements under certain of our government grants of million and million  respectively 
in  research and development expenses decreased approximately million from  primarily due to a reduction in i indirect operating expenses including overhead and internal research and development  and ii direct costs related to our valortim program as a result of the completion in the first quarter of of work under our contract with niaid  offset by higher direct sparvax program expenses 
as a result of the fda clinical hold related to sparvax  costs we recognize in future periods under our sparvax contract related to the sparvax clinical trial  may be substantially less than they otherwise would have been until such time  if ever  as we are able to move forward with the clinical trial 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative functions include executive management  finance and administration  government affairs and regulations  corporate development  human resources  legal  and compliance 
for each function  we may incur expenses such as salaries  supplies and third party consulting and other external costs and non cash expenditures such as expense related to stock option and restricted share awards 
an allocation of indirect costs such as facilities  utilities and other administrative overhead is also included in general and administrative expenses 
expenses associated with general and administrative functions were million for and million for  an approximate decrease 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to was largely due to i a million reduction in legal and professional expenses primarily related to the siga litigation and trial activities and ii a planned reduction in headcount  offset in part by a million insurance recovery that was received in depreciation expense depreciation expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was related to previously purchased assets being fully depreciated during the year ended december  other income expense other income in was million  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily the result of i a million difference in gains related to the changes in fair value of our derivative instruments  ii a million gain in from the sale of canadian assets held for sale  and iii approximately million of additional interest expense in generated from our loans with ge capital  offset by million of income related to the realization of the cumulative translation adjustment upon the substantial liquidation of pharmathene canada  inc in july income taxes the provision for income taxes was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to no provision in the provision for income taxes in resulted from the difference between the treatment of goodwill for income tax purposes and for us gaap 
year ended december  compared to december  revenue we recognized revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our revenue was derived primarily from contracts with the us government for the development of our product candidates 
year ended december  revenue in millions change sparvax rbche aes rbche protexia valortim other total revenue our revenue for the year ended december  changed from primarily due to the following under our contract for the development of sparvax  we recognized approximately million in  an increase of from levels 
the increase in revenue for the sparvax program during is attributable to additional work in preparation and execution of the scale up campaign at our us based sparvax bulk drug substance manufacturer as well as an increase in our billing rate under the contract 
additional activities related to the establishment of analytical and stability indicating assays for characterization of the product 
of the revenue amounts set forth above  million in and million in represent substantive milestone payments that were tied to our successful achievement of certain technical activities 
under the september contract for the advanced development of valortim  we recognized approximately million in a increase from levels 
revenue in reflects both clinical and non clinical work following the release of the fda partial clinical hold in december final patient dosing in clinical trial was completed in april and the in life portion of the trial ended in the third quarter revenue in was largely attributable to reimbursement of costs related to clinical and non clinical studies  including work in connection with the investigation related to the partial clinical hold and certain manufacturing related activities 
under the september contract for the advanced development of protexia  we recognized approximately million in the year ended december   of which million in represent substantive milestone payments that were tied to our successful achievement of certain technical activities 
the decline in revenue is attributed to completion of major development activities for this program in past years 
in  we generated additional revenue of million under the fixed price contract with the dod for the development of the aes for rbche  our nerve agent medical countermeasure  which was awarded in august research and development expenses our research and development expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were attributable to research programs as follows year ended december  change in millions anthrax therapeutic and vaccines chemical nerve agent protectants recombinant dual antigen plague vaccine internal research and development total research and development expenses for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased million from the prior year 
this change was primarily due to the increased technical activity and the achievement of key technical milestones on our sparvax program and the completion of the phase i valortim dose escalation clinical trial partially offset by a decrease in development expenses related to the clinical nerve agent protectants program as a result of the december  shut down of the protexia program 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were net of cost reimbursements under certain of our government grants of million and million  respectively 
included in the grants were million in therapeutic discovery tax grants 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in primarily resulted from a million reduction in bad debt expense and a property loss insurance recovery of million in  partially offset by an increase in non cash stock compensation expenses as well as taxes and other expenses 
the bad debt expenses in consisted primarily of provisions associated with an invoice to our us government customer for the work at avecia as well as the wind down of the third generation anthrax vaccine program 
depreciation and intangible amortization including impairment charges depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily a result of the impairment charge taken in december of approximately million with the closing of our canadian operations 
other income expense other income expense in was a net income of million  compared to a net expense of million in most of the change was due to i a significant reduction in interest expense of million resulting from the conversion of our convertible notes in the fourth quarter of  ii a significant change in the fair value of our derivatives instruments a million loss in compared to a million gain in primarily as a result of the change in our stock price  and iii a million gain on the sale of canadian assets held for sale in liquidity and capital resources overview our primary use of cash during was to fund our operations including our research and development programs and support our general and administrative activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and marketing developments  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  and any future change in our business strategy 
these cash requirements could change materially as a result of shifts in our business and strategy 
the need to raise additional capital will depend on many factors  including but not limited to  our future cash requirements  future contract funding  whether siga prevails in its appeal challenging the trial court ruling awarding us an interest in a portion of the net profits of arestvyr  the timing  amount  and profitability of sales of arestvyr  if any including the timing of siga s recognition of revenue related thereto  and if the trial court ruling is upheld  our ability to collect our portion of net profits related to arestvyr 
historically  we have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
to bridge the gap between payments made to us under our government contracts and grants and our operating and capital needs  we have had to rely on a variety of financing sources  including the issuance of equity securities and equity linked securities and proceeds from loans and other borrowings 
for the foreseeable future  we will continue to need these types of financing vehicles and potentially others to help fund our future operating and capital requirements 
global economic uncertainty continues to make capital markets more volatile and is threatening to once again tighten the credit markets 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we would be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  due to the us government s continuing substantial efforts to stabilize the economy  the us government may be forced or choose to reduce or delay spending in the biodefense field  which could decrease the likelihood of future government contract awards  the likelihood that the government will exercise its right to extend any of its existing contracts with us and or the likelihood that the government would procure products from us 
we have million of cash on hand at december  we also had approximately million in additional funding available to borrow on our revolving line of credit with ge capital 
as a result of the clinical hold placed on our sparvax program in  it is unclear when or if we will be able to commence the planned phase ii human clinical trial 
consequently we expect sparvax related revenues and corresponding research and development expenses until such time  if ever  as we are able to move forward with the clinical trial to be substantially less than they otherwise would have been had we commenced the clinical trial as planned 
nevertheless  we still currently anticipate that our cash on hand  amounts available under the line of credit  and cash to be collected from our various contracts currently in place  will be sufficient to meet the company s ongoing expenses and capital requirements through at least december  cash flows the following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended december   and year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effects of exchange rates on cash   total increase decrease in net cash   sources and uses of cash cash and cash equivalents were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the million increase at december  compared to december  was primarily attributable to the million term loan  which we closed in the first quarter  and the million borrowed under the revolving line of credit  partially offset by million of cash used in operations 
the million decrease at december  as compared to december  was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million from a registered direct public offering of common stock and warrants  as well as million related to the sale of assets in canada  offset by million of cash used in operations 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted for non cash share based compensation expense of million  the million gain on the realization of the cumulative translation adjustment related to pharmathene canada  inc  the decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments of million and other noncash expenses of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million and increase in deferred revenue of approximately million was partially offset by an increase in unbilled accounts receivable of approximately million 
net cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted for the change in market value of non cash derivative instruments of million  the sale of the assets held for sale for a net gain of million and depreciation of million 
net cash used in operations was also impacted by non cash shared based compensation expense of million  a decrease in unbilled accounts receivable of million  prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and accounts payable of million 
net cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted for the change in market value of derivative instruments of million  non cash interest of million  bad debt expense of million  and non cash shared based compensation expenses of million  decreases in unbilled accounts receivable of million and in accounts receivable of million  increases in depreciation and amortization of million including an impairment charge of million primarily associated with the write down of canadian assets  and an increase in accounts payable of million  and adjusted upward by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
investing activities there were no significant investing activities for the year ended december  the net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided of approximately million for the year ended december  investing activities in consisted primarily of the sale of the canadian farm operations 
investing activities for related primarily to liquidating available for sale investments to meet working capital requirements 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million provided by financing activities for the year ended december  the majority of our cash provided by financing for the year ended december   related to our debt arrangements with ge capital  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the term loan of million and approximately million under the revolving line of credit were outstanding as of december  in  we raised net proceeds of approximately million primarily from the issuance and sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants 
in april  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have issued and sold certain stock purchase warrants for fixed exercise prices that range from to 
since these warrants are classified in stockholders equity  any loss in value upon exercise as a result of the warrant being in the money will result in dilution to existing shareholders and such dilution will not be reflected in our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following are contractual commitments at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating facility leases    research and development agreements   term loan    total contractual obligations   this table does not include any royalty payments relating to future sales of products subject to license agreements the company has entered into in relation to its in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
in addition  the table does not include the final payment fee of  on the term loan  which is being accrued and expensed over the term of the agreement  using the effective interest method or the debt discount  which is being amortized over the term of the agreement 
the debt discount and final payment accrual at december  were  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
the company s current operations in foreign countries are minimal 
we have closed our active operations in canada and maintain only nominal operations in the united kingdom 
a change in exchange rates against the us dollar would not have a material impact on earnings  fair values or cash flow 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market interest rates would have a significant impact on their realized value 
our term loan with ge capital is at a fixed rate 
because of the fixed rate  a change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense associated with the loan 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is variable  therefore  a increase in market interest rates above the interest rate floor of  would increase interest expense associated with the line by  if the maximum amount of the line million was drawn for a full year 
the change in fair value of our derivative instruments is calculated utilizing the black scholes model  therefore  a increase decrease in the closing price of pharmathene s common stock at december   would have resulted in a change in fair value of derivative instruments and our earnings of approximately million
