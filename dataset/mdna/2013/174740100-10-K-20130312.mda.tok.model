item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company 
it is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the company and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report on form k 
overview we conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages 
as an insurance provider  we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders 
our core operations include issuing whole life insurance  endowments  credit insurance  final expense  and limited liability property policies 
the company derives its revenues principally from premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds  net investment income  and net realized capital gains and losses 
profitability of our insurance operations depends heavily upon the company s underwriting discipline  as we seek to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  management of claims  use of reinsurance  the size of our in force block  actual mortality and morbidity experience  and our ability to manage our expense ratio  which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors  including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes  proper evaluation of underwriting risks  the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends  the company s response to competitors  and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels 
the company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin 
for many of our insurance products  the company is required to obtain approval for the premium rates from state insurance departments 
the profitability of fixed annuities  riders and other spread based product features depends largely on the company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders 
the investment return  or yield  on invested assets is an important element of the company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid 
the majority of the company s invested assets have been held in available for sale and held to maturity securities  primarily in asset classes of corporate bonds  municipal bonds  and government obligation bonds 
the current and projected low interest rate environment is having a significant impact on the determination of insurance contract liabilities and assets regarding reserves and deferred acquisition costs 
the primary investment objective for the company is to maximize economic value  consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets  while generating sufficient after tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations 
the company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs  regulatory requirements and tax considerations

and consolidated subsidiaries current financial highlights our assets grew from billion as of december   to billion as of december  total stockholders equity increased from million at december   to million at december  insurance premiums rose and in and  respectively  primarily from sales in our life insurance segment  which increased million from amounts reported in net investment income increased and for and  respectively  and was flat in the average yield on the consolidated investment portfolio has declined significantly from a yield of in down to in and continued to decline at a more moderate pace to a yield of in the increase in the investment asset balances due to premium revenue growth was sufficient to offset the lower yield in the declining rate environment and resulted in an increase in net investment income 
realized net investment gains in the past three years resulted primarily from sales of securities that had been previously impaired due to declines in market values 
these gains were partially offset by other than temporary impairments on investment securities and other long term assets that were recorded in  and of   and  respectively  reported as realized losses 
claims and surrenders expense increased from the comparable period in as the home service segment was impacted by hurricane isaac which hit the louisiana coast on august  and caused increased property claims 
in addition  death claims expense in the current year is higher compared to due to the release of incurred but unreported death claims liability in of million 
changes in reserves resulted in liability increases from greater sales of endowment products that build up reserves at a faster pace than whole life longer term mortality based products 
additionally  the sustained low interest rate environment also results in a higher reserve development due to the lower interest yield assumptions in the current period compared to prior years 
life insurance 
for over thirty five years  cica and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for us dollar denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies 
we make our insurance products available using third party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants 
endowment product sales have been on the rise and represented approximately of new sales 
the company offers a ten  fifteen and twenty year endowment and our top selling endowment is a product that matures at age sixty five 
we also introduced a new product in that is an endowment at age eighteen with a payout over four or five years 
through the domestic market of our life insurance segment  we provide ordinary whole life  credit life insurance  and final expense policies to middle and lower income families and individuals in certain markets in the mid west and southern us the majority of our domestic revenues are generated by the operations of domestic life insurance companies we have acquired since home service insurance 
we provide final expense ordinary life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in louisiana  mississippi and arkansas 
our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders  and through networks of funeral homes that collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service 
economic and insurance industry developments significant economic issues impacting our business and industry currently and into the future are discussed below 
it is predicted that the interest rate environment will remain low for the foreseeable future  which translates into lower profit margins for insurers 
we have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed income investment portfolio  primarily invested in callable securities  has been reinvested at lower yields 
the company s conservative investment strategy has not changed  but it has been a challenging investment time  as the large number of bond calls resulted in significant cash balances to be reinvested 
the company experienced some delays in reinvesting the funds as management identified suitable bonds meeting our target characteristics of investment grade and yield parameters were identified 
our investment earnings also impact the reserve and deferred acquisition 
table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries costs dac balances  as assumptions are used in the development of the balances 
due to the recent decline in investment yields on our portfolio  our projection of long term investment returns has declined 
this has resulted in increasing the reserves on policies issued in the current year  as well as reducing the dac asset 
as an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age  we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living products rather than death products  as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime needs 
our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner later years  while continuously providing a death benefit 
we believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies  due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recent economic pressures  as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies 
we believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider 
many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry 
these events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance 
while we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers  we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future  forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us 
if we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage  either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments 
while our management has more than years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents  changes related to foreign government laws and regulations and application of them  along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
acquisition history last five years in  the company acquired ozark national life insurance company onlic  an arkansas domiciled life company 
this entity provided an arkansas field force of home service agents and funeral homes selling pre need and final expense policies and was merged into splic as of october   and is included in the home service segment 
in the first quarter of  the company completed its acquisition of integrity capital corporation icc 
icc is the parent of integrity capital insurance company icic  an indiana life insurance company 
both icc and icic were merged into cica effective april  on august   splic entered into assumption reinsurance agreements with escude life insurance company in rehabilitation  and benton life insurance company in rehabilitation 
at the time the agreements were executed  both companies were under receivership with the louisiana department of insurance 
in total  splic assumed approximately million in reserve liabilities and received approximately million in cash  with a minimal reinsurance ceding commission being paid 
these transactions are accounted for under business combination accounting and are not deemed material

premium income derived from life  accident and health  and property insurance sales  increased during the increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
new sales  termed as first year premiums  increased  and in the life segment in  and endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally with the year endowment and endowment to age as our top products 
in addition  most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision  which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums 
the policy loan asset balance increased and in and  year over year 
net investment income 
net investment income increased to million in compared to million in  despite a decline in the yield on investments as we experienced higher average invested assets as a result of investment of new premium revenue 
net investment income performance is summarized as follows 
years ended december  in thousands  except for net investment income average invested assets  at amortized cost yield on average invested assets yields on invested assets vary between segment operations due to different portfolio mixes in the segments 
the life segment has a higher concentration in us government securities while the home service segment has a larger concentration in the corporate and municipal sectors 
we have traditionally invested in fixed maturity securities with a large percent held in callable issues 
over the past three years  we have experienced significant call activity related to fixed maturity security holdings due to the historically low interest rate environment 
as these call proceeds were primarily invested into lower yielding securities  the yield on the portfolio has declined 
the recent declines in yield rates has been leveling off in recent periods as the reinvestment of calls is resulting in a 
table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries lesser impact relative to yield changes 
if market interest rates begin to rise  our call risk would diminish and our portfolio yield will rise over time  as new money investments would be made at higher rates 
investment income from fixed maturity securities accounted for approximately of total investment income for the year ended december  we have reduced investment holdings in bonds of us government sponsored enterprises  such as federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  which comprised of the total fixed maturity portfolio based on amortized cost at december  we have increased our investment purchases of corporate and municipal securities over the past several years  focusing on utility service sectors in these security categories 
in addition  we reinvested proceeds from bond calls totaling million into equity securities related to bond mutual funds in and continuing into these securities offer a competitive yield with a shorter duration 
years ended december  in thousands gross investment income fixed maturity securities equity securities mortgage loans policy loans long term investments other total investment income less investment expenses net investment income investment income from fixed maturity investments increased for the year of due to a rise in investment holdings based upon amortized cost of million 
the increase in earnings on asset balances of fixed maturity and equity securities from new money investments is offsetting the basis point yield decline for the year 
in addition  the increase in the policy loans asset balance  which represents policyholders utilizing their accumulated policy cash value  contributed to the increase to investment income

decrease in fair value of warrants 
in  all of the remaining warrants outstanding were either exercised or converted into our class a common stock  due to an election by the warrant holders  or expiration 
we recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the and gain was the result of the significant decrease in the number of warrants outstanding due to expirations and exercises 
the gain in was directly related to the decrease in the price of our class a common stock 
the warrant liability was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire 
current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues 
when the liability increased we incurred a loss  and when the liability decreased we recognized income

additionally  results include a million incurred but not reported release of liability related to our claim expense calculation 
policy surrenders increased in  and  but remained at a level that represents approximately of direct ordinary whole life insurance inforce 
the increase in surrender expense is primarily related to our international business and is expected to increase over time due to the aging of this block of business 
a significant portion of surrenders relates to policies that have been in force over fifteen years and no longer have a surrender charge associated with them 
total direct insurance inforce reported in and was billion compared to billion in endowment benefits increased in each of the last three years 
we have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount selected by the policy owner 
these benefits have been popular in the pacific rim and latin america  where the company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years 
like policy dividends  annual guaranteed endowments are factored into the premium and  as such  the increase has no impact on profitability 
the company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases and persists

the reported property claim amounts were lower than historical experience 
reserves 
the change in future policy benefit reserves has increased and in and due primarily to the current low interest rate environment necessitating higher reserves for policies issued in the last few years due to lower long term yield projections compared to prior assumptions

deferred policy acquisition costs 
capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs dac were million  million and million in  and these costs will vary based upon successful efforts related to newly issued policies and renewal business 
significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business which have higher commission rates 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is impacted by persistency and may fluctuate from year to year 
amortization costs increased in compared to as a result of the asset balance growth 
policy persistency was comparable in the life segment for the periods presented  but declined in the home service segment in and  resulting in higher amortization 
in addition  the prolonged low interest rate environment impacted the assumptions used in the development of the dac asset for new policies issued in and this resulted in a lower dac balance and increased amortization by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
cost of customer relationships acquired and other intangibles

endowment benefit expense results from the election by policyholders of a product feature that provides an annual benefit 
this is a fixed benefit over the life of the contract  and this expense will increase with new sales and improved persistency 
other policy benefits increased in the current year due primarily to interest paid on premium deposits and dividend accumulations  as these policyholder liability accounts have increased 
increase in future policy benefit reserves 
policy benefit reserves in increased compared to the same periods in  primarily from the effect of the current low interest rate environment on reserve development for policies issued in the last few years which have higher reserve build up compared to prior issue years 
the accounting guidance of long duration contracts we sell requires the company to lock in the original assumptions such as mortality  interest  surrenders and expenses at the time the initial policies are written  therefore gains or losses attributable to actual experience that differs from the original assumptions flows through the income statement in the period where in the differences occur

the reserve liability had been previously set up relative to this policy feature and was decreased by  based upon the system calculated value 
commissions 
commission expense decreased in compared to and because agents are compensated based upon month to month route premium growth that has been impacted by increased policy lapses 
this results in a lower commission to premium relationship as compensation is reduced

other general expenses 
the expenses are allocated by segment based upon an annual expense study performed by the company and were down in due to lower audit and actuarial fees as well as employee benefit related costs 
other general expenses decreased in compared to  due to an overall decrease in expenses and a reallocation of expenses that became effective january   which reduced the home service segment allocation by million and increased the life segment allocation for that year 
capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
dac capitalization is directly correlated to fluctuations in first year commissions

the company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on going basis relative to changes in credit ratings  market prices  earnings trends and financial performance  in addition to specific region or industry reviews 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case by case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the company determines other than temporary impairment otti by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the company intent to sell the security  or if it is more likely than not that the company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost 
when an otti has occurred  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  an otti is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the otti will be separated into the following a the amount representing the credit loss  and b the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
we recorded an otti write down in of  related to one coal powered energy issuer debt security holding which has a maturity date in the operations of this energy provider have been negatively impacted by the challenging environment in the coal fired generation sector and overall decline in the price of power it can charge to customers 
the company recorded an otti of  in related to one american airlines bond holding  as the issuer filed for bankruptcy 
an additional impairment of  was recorded in to write a security down to zero carrying value 
based upon our emphasis on investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of obligations of us government sponsored corporations and our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other than temporary  management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at december  were not impaired  and no additional other than temporary losses need to be recorded

reinsurance as is customary among insurance companies  our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite 
a primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and  by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain  to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements 
even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured  our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
we believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus 
the effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows 
for the years ended december  in thousands direct premiums reinsurance assumed reinsurance ceded net premiums our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer 
the primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large  well capitalized entities

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to a company ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources 
our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations 
premium deposits and revenues  investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds  while investment purchases  policy benefits  and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds 
we historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow  and there were no liquidity issues in or our investments consist of of marketable debt securities and of equity securities classified as available for sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs 
a primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals 
we include provisions within our insurance policies  such as surrender charges  that help limit and discourage early withdrawals 
since these contractual withdrawals  as well as the level of surrenders experienced  have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  our associated cash outflows have  historically  not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
we currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds 
cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs 
cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled fixed maturity security calls  maturities  redemptions  and prepayments  which totaled million  million and million in  and these cash flows  for the most part  are reinvested in fixed income securities 
net cash outflows from investment activity totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the outflows from investing activities for the year ended december   primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during the company cash flows from financing activities were million in  million in and million in the naic has established minimum capital requirements in the form of rbc 
rbc considers the type of business written by an insurance company  the quality of its assets  and various other aspects of an insurance company business to develop a minimum level of capital called authorized control level risk based capital and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles  plus certain investment reserves 
should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk based capital fall below  a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required 
at december   all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum rbc levels

the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  therefore  does not expect any future effects on the company financial condition related to any such arrangements 
we do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles  nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature  and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions 
parent company liquidity and capital resources citizens is a holding company and has had minimal operations of its own 
our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  cash  fixed income securities  mutual funds and investment real estate 
our cash flows depend primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments  primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries  cica and splic 
the ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of colorado  cica state of domicile  and louisiana  splic state of domicile  which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company 
we historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs 
however  cica and splic both dividend available funds from time to time in relation to new acquisition target strategies 
cica has contributed amounts in the form of dividends to citizens totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  a substantial portion of our international policyholders invest their policy cash dividends and benefits in our class a common stock through our stock investment plan the plan 
once a policyholder elects to participate in the plan  their policy benefits can be used to purchase citizens class a common stock through the plan in the open market 
in addition  our existing holders of class a common stock  our employees and our independent consultants are eligible to participate in the plan 
if fewer policyholders elect to participate in the plan  or if our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory or marketing impediments  the trading volume of our class a common stock may decline from its present levels

and consolidated subsidiaries critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate  or different estimates that could have been selected  could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
while we believe that our estimates  assumptions  and judgments are reasonable  they are based on information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly 
additionally  changes in our assumptions  estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them 
see footnote no 
 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our financial statements for further information on our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are as follows policy liabilities future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields  dividends on participating business  mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves 
management judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation 
we continue to use the original assumptions including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits the lock in concept unless a premium deficiency exists 
management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of december  management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended december   and are based upon assumptions  including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation  that do not warrant revision 
deferred policy acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions and policy issuance  underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business  are deferred 
these deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated  using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
we utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance 
the factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period 
the factor method ensures that policies that lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation 
the factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value  provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors 
inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred  the ending asset balance and the annual amortization 
approximately of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions 
the remaining are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance business 
those costs generally include costs related to the production  underwriting and issuance of new business 
a recoverability test that considers  among other things  actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually 
these annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium for the next years 
the available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated 
the deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions 
the two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early deferred 
table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries policy acquisition recoverability period 
the two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs 
management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended december   and limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value 
this belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business  utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing 
cost of customer relationships acquired cost of customer relationships acquired ccra is established when we purchase a block of insurance 
ccra is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
we utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance  including a static model and a dynamic model 
inherent in the amortization of ccra are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization 
the assumptions used are based upon interest  mortality and lapses at the time of purchase 
a recoverability test that considers  among other things  actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually 
these annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium for the next thirty years 
the ccra is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions 
management believes our ccra and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended december   and this belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing 
goodwill current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment 
most of the company reporting units  for which goodwill has been allocated  are equivalent to the company operating segment  as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test follows a multi step process as defined under current accounting guidance 
an initial review may be performed whereby the assessment is based upon a qualitative factors before performing the first test step 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
management determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations  peer company price to earnings multiples  the level of the company class a common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit 
other assumptions can include levels of economic capital  future business growth  and earnings projections 
valuation of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities the evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer financial condition or future prospects  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period 
based upon current accounting guidance  investment securities must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase 
the classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
fixed maturity securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity 
securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with the unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries the company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations  for determining if an otti exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines 
in evaluating the possible impairment of securities  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial conditions and near term prospects of the issuer  and the ability and intent of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in analyzing an issuer financial condition  the company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  by government sponsored agencies  or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and reviews of the issuer financial condition 
if management determines that an investment experienced an otti  management must then determine the amount of otti to be recognized in earnings 
if management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of otti related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
if management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the otti will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain as other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold 
the company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset liability management decisions  future market movements  business plan changes  or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time 
premium revenue and related expenses premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or  for short duration contracts  over the contract period on a pro rata basis 
benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts 
this matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments 
our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges 
tax accounting a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that it is more likely than not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit 
these determinations inherently involve management judgment 
in addition  the company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized 
this valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset 
management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and capital position
