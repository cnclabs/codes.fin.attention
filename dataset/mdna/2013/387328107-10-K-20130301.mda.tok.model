item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we also utilize the design build and construction management general contract methods of project delivery 
unlike traditional projects where owners first hire a design firm or design a project themselves and then put the project out to bid for construction  design build projects provide the owner with a single point of responsibility and a single contact for both final design and construction 
although design build projects carry additional risk as compared to traditional bid build projects  the profit potential can also be higher 
under the construction management general contract method of delivery  we contract with owners to manage the design phase of the contract with the understanding that we will negotiate a contract on the construction phase when the design nears completion 
revenue from design build and construction management general contract projects represented and of large project construction revenue in and  respectively 
construction materials revenue from our construction materials segment was million and million and of our total revenue in and  respectively 
the construction materials segment mines and processes aggregates and operates plants that produce construction materials for internal use and for sale to third parties 
we have significant aggregate reserves that we have acquired by ownership in fee or through long term leases 
aggregate products used in our construction projects represented approximately of our tons sold during and ranged from to over the last five years 
the remainder is sold to third parties 
real estate granite land company glc is an investor in a diversified portfolio of land assets and provides real estate services for other granite operations 
glc s current investment portfolio consists of residential as well as retail and office site development projects for sale to home and commercial property developers 
the range of its involvement in an individual project may vary from passive investment to management of land use rights  development  construction  leasing and eventual sale of the project 
generally  glc has teamed with partners who have local knowledge and expertise in the development of each property 

table of contents glc s current investments are located in washington  california and texas 
revenue from glc was million and million and of our total revenue in and  respectively 
in october  we announced our enterprise improvement plan that includes plans to orderly divest of our real estate investment business 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and restructuring charges under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
business strategy our fundamental objective is to increase long term shareholder value as measured by the appreciation of the value of our common stock over a period of time as well as dividend yields 
a specific measure of our financial success is the achievement of a return on net assets greater than the cost of capital  creating granite value added 
the following are key factors in our ability to achieve these objectives aggregate materials we own and lease aggregate reserves and own processing plants that are vertically integrated into our construction operations 
by ensuring availability of these resources and providing quality products  we believe we have a competitive advantage in many of our markets as well as a source of revenue and earnings from the sale of construction materials to third parties 
controlled growth we intend to grow our business by working on many types of infrastructure projects as well as by expanding into new geographic areas organically and through acquisitions 
in addition  we focus our efforts on larger projects wherein our financial strength and project experience provide us with a competitive advantage 
decentralized profit centers each of our operating groups is established as an individual profit center which encourages entrepreneurial activity while allowing the groups to benefit from centralized administrative and support functions 
diversification to mitigate the risks inherent in the construction business as the result of general economic factors  we pursue projects i in both the public and private sectors  ii in federal  rail  power and renewable energy markets  iii for a wide range of customers within each sector from the federal government to small municipalities and from large corporations to individual homeowners  iv in diverse geographic markets  v that are construction management general contractor  design build  fixed price and fixed unit price and vi of various sizes  durations and complexity 
in addition to pursuing opportunities with traditional project funding  we continue to evaluate other sources of project funding eg  public private partnerships 
employee development we believe that our employees are key to the successful implementation of our business strategies 
significant resources are employed to attract  develop and retain extraordinary talent and fully promote each employee s capabilities 
infrastructure construction focus we concentrate our core competencies on this segment of the construction industry  which includes the building of roads  highways  bridges  dams  tunnels  mass transit facilities  airport and railroad infrastructure  underground utilities and site preparation 
this focus allows us to most effectively utilize our specialized strengths  which include grading  paving and construction of concrete structures 
ownership of construction equipment we own a large fleet of well maintained heavy construction equipment 
the ownership of construction equipment enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability of the equipment at a favorable cost 
profit based incentives profit center managers are incentivized with cash compensation and restricted equity awards  payable upon the attainment of pre established annual financial and non financial metrics 
selective bidding we focus our resources on bidding jobs that meet our selective bidding criteria  which include analyzing the risk of a potential job relative to i available personnel to estimate and prepare the proposal  ii available personnel to effectively manage and build the project  iii the competitive environment  iv our experience with the type of work  v our experience with the owner  vi local resources and partnerships  vii equipment resources  viii the size and complexity of the job and ix profitability 
our operating principles include accident prevention we believe accident prevention is a moral obligation as well as good business 
by identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards  we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents 
quality and high ethical standards we believe in the importance of performing high quality work 
additionally  we believe in maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and an effective corporate compliance program 
sustainability our focus on sustainability encompasses many aspects of how we conduct ourselves and practice our core values 
we believe sustainability is important to our customers  employees  shareholders  and communities  and is also a long term business driver 
by focusing on specific initiatives that address social  environmental and economic challenges  we can minimize risk and increase our competitive advantage 

table of contents raw materials we purchase raw materials consisting of aggregate products  cement  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt  natural gas  propane and steel from numerous sources 
our aggregate reserves supply a portion of the raw materials needed in our construction projects 
the price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to market conditions and production capacities 
we do not foresee the lack of availability of any raw materials in the near term 
seasonality our operations are typically affected by weather conditions during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year which may alter our construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues  profitability and the required number of employees 
customers customers in our construction segment include certain federal agencies  state departments of transportation  county and city public works departments  school districts and developers and owners of industrial  commercial and residential sites 
customers of our large project construction segment are predominantly in the public sector and currently include various state departments of transportation  local transit authorities and federal agencies 
customers of our construction materials segment include internal usage on our own construction  as well as third party customers including  but not limited to  contractors  landscapers  manufacturers of products requiring aggregate materials  retailers  homeowners  farmers and brokers 
during the years ended december  and  our largest volume customer was the california department of transportation caltrans 
revenue recognized from contracts with caltrans represented of our total revenue  of our construction revenue and of our large project construction revenue in and of our total revenue  of our construction revenue and of our large project construction revenue in during the year ended  our largest volume customer was maryland state highway administration md sha 
revenue recognized from contracts with md sha represented of our total revenue and of our large project construction revenue in public sector revenue in california represented  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
contract backlog our contract backlog is comprised of the unearned portion of revenue on awarded contracts that have not been completed  including of the unearned revenue of our consolidated joint ventures and our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts 
we generally include a project in our contract backlog at the time a contract is awarded and funding is in place 
certain federal government contracts where funding is appropriated on a periodic basis are included in contract backlog at the time of the award 
substantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer  however  we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past see contract provisions and subcontracting 
many projects in our construction segment are added and completed within a year and therefore may not be reflected in our beginning or year end contract backlog 
contract backlog by segment is presented in contract backlog under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our contract backlog was approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
approximately billion of the december  contract backlog is expected to be completed during 
table of contents equipment at december  and  we owned the following number of construction equipment and vehicles december  heavy construction equipment trucks  truck tractors  trailers and vehicles our portfolio of equipment includes backhoes  barges  bulldozers  cranes  excavators  loaders  motor graders  pavers  rollers  scrapers  trucks and tunnel boring machines that are used in our construction  large project construction and construction materials business segments 
we believe that ownership of equipment is generally preferable to leasing because it ensures the equipment is available as needed and normally results in lower costs 
we pool certain equipment for use by our construction  large project construction and construction materials segments to maximize utilization 
we continually monitor and adjust our fleet size so that it is consistent with the size of our business  considering both existing backlog and expected future work 
on a short term basis  we lease or rent equipment to supplement existing equipment in response to construction activity peaks 
in and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on purchases of construction equipment and vehicles 
employees on december   we employed approximately  salaried employees who work in management  estimating and clerical capacities  plus approximately  hourly employees 
the total number of hourly personnel is subject to the volume of construction in progress and is seasonal 
during  the number of hourly employees ranged from approximately  to  and averaged approximately  three of our wholly owned subsidiaries  granite construction company  granite construction northeast  inc  and kenny construction company  are parties to craft collective bargaining agreements in many areas in which they work 
we believe our employees are our most valuable resource and that our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company 
among salaried and non union hourly employees  this dedication is reinforced by an equity ownership at december  through our employee stock purchase plan  profit sharing and k plan and performance based incentive compensation arrangements 
our managerial and supervisory personnel have an average of approximately eleven years of service with us 
competition competitors of our construction segment typically come from small local construction companies as well as large regional  national and international construction companies 
we compete with numerous companies in individual markets  however  there are few companies which compete in all of our market areas 
many of our construction segment competitors have the ability to perform work in either the private or public sectors 
when opportunities for work in one sector are reduced  competitors tend to look for opportunities in the other sector 
this migration has the potential to reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
the scale and complexity of jobs in the large project construction segment preclude many smaller contractors from bidding such work 
consequently  our large project construction segment competition typically comes from large regional  national and global construction companies 
we own and or have long term leases on aggregate resources that we believe may provide a competitive advantage in certain markets for both the construction and large project construction segments 
competitors of our construction materials segment range from small local materials companies to large regional  national and global materials companies 
we compete with numerous companies in individual markets  however  there are few companies which compete in all of our market areas 
the unprecedented demand for construction materials during through prompted many materials suppliers to increase production and sales capacities in many of the markets in which we compete 
the subsequent reduction in demand  primarily driven by a reduction in residential and commercial development  has increased the level of competition to sell construction materials 
factors influencing our competitiveness include price  estimating abilities  knowledge of local markets and conditions  project management  financial strength  reputation for quality  the availability of aggregate materials  and machinery and equipment 
historically  the construction business has not required large amounts of capital  particularly for the smaller size construction work pursued by our construction segment  which can result in relative ease of market entry for companies possessing acceptable qualifications 
although the construction business is highly competitive  we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate 

table of contents contract provisions and subcontracting our contracts with our customers are primarily fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete placed or cubic yard of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  errors in our estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk of performing all the work for the specified amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts excluding fixed unit price contracts in our contract backlog decreased to approximately at december  compared with approximately at december  our construction contracts are obtained through competitive bidding in response to solicitations by both public agencies and private parties and on a negotiated basis as a result of solicitations from private parties 
project owners use a variety of methods to make contractors aware of new projects  including posting bidding opportunities on agency websites  disclosing long term infrastructure plans  advertising and other general solicitations 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as the nature and volume of advertising and other solicitations  contract backlog  available personnel  current utilization of equipment and other resources  our ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
our contract review process includes identifying risks and opportunities during the bidding process and managing these risks through mitigation efforts such as contract negotiation  insurance and pricing 
contracts fitting certain criteria of size and complexity are reviewed by various levels of management and  in some cases  by the executive committee of our board of directors 
bidding activity  contract backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
there are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance and results as compared to a project s original bid 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  cost associated with scope changes where final price negotiations are not complete  extended overhead due to owner  weather and other delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment or materials 
all of these factors can impose inefficiencies on contract performance  which can increase costs and lower profits 
conversely  positive variations in any of these or other factors can decrease costs and improve profitability 
however  the ability to realize improvements on project profitability is often more limited than the risk of lower profitability 
design build projects typically incur additional costs such as right of way and permit acquisition costs and carry additional risks such as design error risk and the risk associated with estimating quantities and prices before the project design is completed 
these unknown factors may cause higher than anticipated construction costs and additional liability to the contract owner 
we manage this additional risk by adding contingencies to our bid amounts  obtaining errors and omissions insurance and obtaining indemnifications from our design consultants where possible 
however  there is no guarantee that these risk management strategies will always be successful 
most of our contracts  including those with the government  provide for termination at the convenience of the contract owner  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we have not been materially adversely affected by these provisions in the past 
many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met and these amounts could be significant 
we act as prime contractor on most of our construction projects 
we complete the majority of our projects with our own resources and subcontract specialized activities such as electrical and mechanical work 
as prime contractor  we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  we may be subject to increased costs associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities  among other criteria  we determine whether to require the subcontractor to furnish a bond or other type of security to guarantee their performance 
disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our best efforts to subcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged contractors or suppliers 
as with all of our subcontractors  some may not be able to obtain surety bonds or other types of performance security 

table of contents insurance and bonding we maintain general and excess liability  construction equipment and workers compensation insurance  all in amounts consistent with industry practice 
in connection with our business  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our contract backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
the capacity of the surety market is subject to market based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation 
when the surety market capacity shrinks it results in higher premiums and increased difficulty obtaining bonding  in particular for larger  more complex projects throughout the market 
in order to help mitigate this risk  we employ a co surety structure involving three sureties 
although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity have significantly affected our ability to grow our business  there is no assurance that it will not significantly affect our ability to obtain new contracts in the future see item a 
risk factors 
environmental regulations our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non compliance and others  such as the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  impose strict  retroactive  joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances 
we continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws 
while compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
in addition  our aggregate materials operations require operating permits granted by governmental agencies 
we believe that tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and other factors will make it increasingly difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist 
in july  the california air resources board carb approved a regulation that will require california equipment owners operators to reduce diesel particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions from in use off road diesel equipment and to meet progressively more restrictive emission targets from to in december  carb approved a similar regulation for in use on road diesel equipment that includes more restrictive emission targets from to the emission targets will require california off road and on road diesel equipment owners to retrofit equipment with diesel emission control devices or replace equipment with new engine technology as it becomes available  which will result in higher equipment related expenses 
in december  carb amended both regulations to grant economic relief to affected fleets by extending initial compliance dates from to as well as adding additional compliance requirements 
to date  costs to prepare the company for compliance have been minimal 
at this time we do not expect the full cost of compliance to be significant and we will continue to manage compliance costs  however  it is not possible to determine the future cost of compliance 
as is the case with other companies in our industry  some of our aggregate products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica  a common mineral 
also  some of our construction and material processing operations release  as dust  crystalline silica that is in the materials being handled 
excessive  prolonged inhalation of very small sized particles of crystalline silica has allegedly been associated with respiratory disease including silicosis 
the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust 
we have implemented dust control procedures to measure compliance with requisite thresholds and to verify that respiratory protective equipment is made available as necessary 
we also communicate  through safety information sheets and other means  what we believe to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive  prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular

table of contents item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise adversely affect our business 
unfavorable economic conditions have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business 
the recent turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
in particular  low tax revenues  budget deficits  financing constraints and competing priorities have resulted in  and may continue to result in  cutbacks in new infrastructure projects in the public sector and could have an adverse impact on collectibility of receivables from government agencies 
in addition  levels of new commercial and residential construction projects have been adversely affected by oversupply of existing inventories of commercial and residential properties  low property values and a restrictive financing environment 
the depressed demand for construction and construction materials in both the public and private sectors has resulted in intensified competition  which has had an adverse impact on both our revenues and profit margins and could impact growth opportunities 
although conditions are stabilizing  these factors have also had an adverse impact on the levels of activity and financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity of our real estate investment and development business 
deterioration of the united states economy could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
congress inability to lower united states debt substantially could result in a decrease in government spending  which could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new infrastructure projects 
in addition  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the united states as well as throughout the world  which may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain financing and or could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
deterioration in general economic activity and infrastructure spending or congress deficit reduction measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
as a part of our growth strategy we have made and may make future acquisitions  and acquisitions involve many risks 
these risks include difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from ongoing operations  potential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to increase our liabilities  record goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to subsequent impairment testing and potential impairment charges  as well as amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our strategic diversification plan  as well as  the acquisition of kenny construction company includes growing our international operations in canada and us territories  which are subject to a number of special risks 
as part of our strategic diversification efforts we plan on entering into more construction contracts in canada or us territories  which may subject us to a number of special risks  including risks associated with lesser developed legal systems in which to enforce contractual rights  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  foreign currency exchange volatility  uncertain and changing tax rules  regulations and rates  logistical and communication challenges  potentially adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  changes in labor conditions  general economic  political and financial conditions in foreign markets  and exposure to civil or criminal liability under the foreign corrupt practices act  the canadian corruption of foreign public officials act  anti boycott rules  trade and export control regulations  and the corporate manslaughter and corporate homicide act  as well as other international regulations 
due to the special risks associated with non us operations  our exposure to such risks may not be proportionate to the percentage of our revenues attributable to such operations 

table of contents changes to our outsourced software vendors as well as any sudden loss  breach of security  disruption or unexpected data or vendor loss associated with our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on third party software to run critical accounting  project management and financial information systems 
if software vendors decide to discontinue further development  integration or long term software maintenance support for our information systems  or there is any system interruption  delay  breach of security  loss of data or loss of a vendor  we may need to migrate some or all of our accounting  project management and financial information to other systems 
despite business continuity plans  these disruptions could increase our operational expense as well as impact the management of our business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
an inability to safeguard our information technology environment could result in business interruptions  remediation costs and or legal claims 
to protect confidential customer  vendor  financial and employee information  we employ information security measures that secure our information systems from cybersecurity attacks or breaches 
even with these measures  we may be subject to unauthorized access of digital data with the intent to misappropriate information  corrupt data or cause operational disruptions 
if a failure of our safeguarding measures were to occur  it could have a negative impact to our business and result in business interruptions  remediation costs and or legal claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
we work in a highly competitive marketplace 
we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work  and some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater resources than we do 
during economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for public works projects  competition for the fewer available public projects typically intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in new awards at acceptable profit margins 
in addition  downturns in residential and commercial construction activity increases the competition for available public sector work  further impacting our revenue  contract backlog and profit margins 
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel  joint venture partners and subcontractors in a competitive environment 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel  joint venture partners  advisors and subcontractors 
changes in general or local economic conditions and the resulting impact on the labor market and on our joint venture partners may make it difficult to attract or retain qualified individuals in the geographic areas where we perform our work 
if we are unable to provide competitive compensation packages  high quality training programs  attractive work environments or to establish and maintain successful partnerships  our ability to profitably execute our work could be adversely impacted 
strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of our craft workforce 
although strikes or work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our operations or results in the past  such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations and results if they occur in the future 
failure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses 
construction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces and often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment  moving vehicles  chemical and manufacturing processes  and highly regulated materials 
on many sites  we are responsible for safety and  accordingly  must implement safety procedures 
if we fail to implement these procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective  we may suffer the loss of or injury to our employees  as well as expose ourselves to possible litigation 
despite having invested significant resources in safety programs and being recognized as an industry leader  a serious accident may nonetheless occur on one of our worksites 
as a result  our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients  and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
government contracts generally have strict regulatory requirements 
approximately of our consolidated revenue in was derived from contracts funded by federal  state and local government agencies and authorities 
government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations  contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation  administration  performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance 
claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought for violations of regulations  requirements or statutes 
we may also be subject to qui tam whistle blower litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the federal civil false claims act  which could include claims for up to treble damages 
further  if we fail to comply with any of the regulations  requirements or statutes or if we have a substantial number of accumulated occupational safety and health administration  mine safety and health administration or other workplace safety violations  our existing government contracts could be terminated and we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting  including federally funded projects at the state level 
should one or more of these events occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents government contractors are subject to suspension or debarment from government contracting 
our substantial dependence on government contracts exposes us to a variety of risks that differ from those associated with private sector contracts 
various statutes to which our operations are subject  including the davis bacon act which regulates wages and benefits  the walsh healy act which prescribes a minimum wage and regulates overtime and working conditions  executive order which establishes equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements and the drug free workplace act  provide for mandatory suspension and or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances involving statutory violations 
in addition  the federal acquisition regulation and various state statutes provide for discretionary suspension and or debarment in certain circumstances that might call into question a contractor s willingness or ability to act responsibly  including as a result of being convicted of  or being found civilly liable for  fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining  attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract 
the scope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts and the statutory or regulatory grounds for debarment and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we may be unable to identify qualified disadvantaged business enterprise dbe contractors to perform as subcontractors 
certain of our government agency projects contain minimum dbe participation clauses 
if we subsequently fail to complete these projects with the minimum dbe participation  we may be held responsible for breach of contract damages which may include restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects as well as monetary damages 
to the extent we are responsible for monetary damages  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates  we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
fixed price and fixed unit price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost 
as more fully described in contract provisions and subcontracting under item business  the profitability of our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid 
design build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions 
design build is increasingly being used as a method of project delivery as it provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction 
we generally subcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms 
however  in the event of a design error or omission causing damages  there is risk that the subcontractor or their errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the liability 
in this case we may be responsible  resulting in a potentially material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
many of our contracts have penalties for late completion 
in some instances  including many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay  generally in the form of contractually agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent these events occur  the total cost of the project could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or a loss on that project 
accounting for our revenues and costs involves significant estimates 
as further described in critical accounting policies and estimates under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  accounting for our contract related revenues and costs  as well as other expenses  requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates  these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
failure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results 
as further described in contract provisions and subcontracting under item business  we subcontract portions of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors  but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work 
although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees  we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher risk subcontractors 
in this case we may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated  resulting in a potentially adverse impact on our cash flows and liquidity 
in addition  the total costs of a project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project  which could have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents we use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations 
diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based products are used to fuel and lubricate our equipment and fire our asphalt concrete processing plants 
in addition  they constitute a significant part of the asphalt paving materials that are used in many of our construction projects and are sold to third parties 
although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts  many contracts provide no such protection 
we also use steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
we pre purchase commodities  enter into supply agreements or enter into financial contracts to secure pricing 
we have not been significantly adversely affected by price fluctuations in the past  however  there is no guarantee that we will not be in the future 
we are subject to environmental and other regulation 
as more fully described in environmental regulations under item business  we are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  workplace safety and a variety of socioeconomic requirements 
noncompliance with such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties  or termination or suspension of government contracts as well as civil and criminal liability 
in addition  some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
we occasionally evaluate various alternatives with respect to our facilities  including possible dispositions or closures 
investigations undertaken in connection with these activities may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated  and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities 
while compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurance that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination will not require us to make significant remediation or restoration expenditures 
weather can significantly affect our quarterly revenues and profitability 
our ability to perform work is significantly affected by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature 
changes in weather conditions can cause delays and otherwise significantly affect our project costs 
the impact of weather conditions can result in variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability  particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
our joint venture contracts with project owners subject us to joint and several liability 
as further described in joint ventures  off balance sheet arrangements under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in connection with complex construction projects 
if our joint venture partner fails to perform under one of these contracts  we could be liable for completion of the entire contract 
if the contract were unprofitable  this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
increasing restrictions on securing aggregate reserves could negatively affect our future operations and results 
tighter regulations and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure aggregate reserves 
although we have thus far been able to secure reserves to support our business  our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by an increasingly difficult permitting process 

table of contents granite land company is greatly affected by the strength of the real estate industry 
our real estate investment and development activities are subject to numerous factors beyond our control including local real estate market conditions  substantial existing and potential competition  general national  regional and local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability and changes in demographic conditions 
if our outlook for a project s forecasted profitability deteriorates  we may find it necessary to curtail our development activities and evaluate our real estate assets for possible impairment 
our evaluation includes a variety of estimates and assumptions and future changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect future impairment analyses 
if our real estate assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment would result in a write down of the asset in the period of the impairment 
see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on impairment charges 
our decision in october to orderly divest of our real estate investment business resulted in changes to the business plans of certain of our real estate affiliates and the recognition of impairment charges primarily in the fourth quarter of  with no significant impairment charges during the years ended december  and the business plans of our real estate affiliates include estimates of our ability to obtain certain development rights  our ability to obtain financing  the future condition of the real estate and financial markets  and the timing of cash flows 
a continued decline in the residential and or commercial real estate markets may decrease  or lengthen  the timing of expected cash flows of certain development projects to the point that we would be required to recognize additional valuation impairments in the future 
our real estate investments are subject to mortgage financing and may require additional funding 
granite land company s real estate investments generally utilize short term debt financing for their development activities 
such financing is subject to the terms of the applicable debt or credit agreement and generally is secured by mortgages on the applicable real property 
glc s failure to comply with the covenants applicable to such financing or to pay principal  interest or other amounts when due thereunder would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreement and could have the effects described in the following risk factor relating to our debt and credit agreements 
due to the tightening of the credit markets  banks have required lower loan to value ratios often resulting in the need to pay a portion of the debt when short term financing is renegotiated 
if our real estate investment partners are unable to make their proportional share of a required repayment  glc may elect to provide the additional funding which could materially affect our financial position  cash flows and liquidity 
also  if we determine we are the primary beneficiary  as defined by the applicable accounting guidance  we may be required to consolidate additional real estate investments in our financial statements 
failure to remain in compliance with covenants under our debt and credit agreements  service our indebtedness  or fund our other liquidity needs could adversely impact our business 
the recent recession and credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our debt and credit agreements and related restrictive covenants are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our failure to comply with any of these covenants  or to pay principal  interest or other amounts when due thereunder  would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreements 
under certain circumstances  the occurrence of an event of default under one of our debt or credit agreements or the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness under one of our agreements may constitute an event of default under one or more of our other debt or credit agreements 
default under our debt and credit agreements could result in us no longer being entitled to borrow under the agreements  termination of the agreements  the requirement that any letters of credit under the agreements be cash collateralized  acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements and or foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under the agreements 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we could be forced to curtail our operations  reorganize our capital structure including through bankruptcy proceedings or liquidate some or all of our assets in a manner that could cause holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investment in us 
force majeure events  including natural disasters and terrorists actions  could negatively impact our business  which may affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
force majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties  such as natural and man made disasters  as well as terrorist actions  could negatively impact the economies in which we operate 
we typically remain obligated to perform our services after such extraordinary events unless the contract contains a force majeure clause relieving us of our contractual obligations in such an extraordinary event 
if we are not able to react quickly to force majeure events  our operations may be affected significantly  which would have a negative impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents unavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative effect on our operations and results 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts 
although we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future  and our inability to obtain such coverage could have an adverse impact on our ability to procure new work  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
an inability to obtain bonding could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
as more fully described in insurance and bonding under item business  we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts 
our inability to obtain reasonably priced surety bonds in the future could significantly affect our ability to be awarded new contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
a change in tax laws or regulations of any federal  state or international jurisdiction in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we continue to assess the impact of various us federal  state and international legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our us federal  state and or international taxes 
we cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation 
however  if such proposals were to be enacted  or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations  the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us  including increasing our tax burden  increasing our cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we may be required to contribute cash to meet our unfunded pension obligations in certain multi employer plans 
three of our wholly owned subsidiaries  granite construction company  granite construction northeast  inc and kenny construction company participate in various multi employer pension plans on behalf of union employees 
union employee benefits generally are based on a fixed amount for each year of service 
we are required to make contributions to the plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements 
pension expense is recognized as contributions are made 
under the employee retirement income security act  a contributor to a multi employer plan is liable  upon termination or withdrawal from a plan  for its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested liability 
while we currently have no intention of withdrawing from a plan and unfunded pension obligations have not significantly affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to make material cash contributions to one or more of these plans to satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations in the future 
our contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or  if realized  will be profitable 
projects reflected in our contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations  scope adjustments  time extensions or other changes 
such changes may adversely affect the revenue and profit we ultimately realize on these projects 
the foregoing list is not all inclusive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us 
these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
for these reasons  the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

item properties quarry properties as of december   we had active and inactive permitted quarry properties available for the extraction of sand and gravel and hard rock  all of which are located in the western united states 
all of our quarries are open pit and are primarily accessible by road 
we process aggregates into construction materials for internal use and for sale to third parties 
the following map shows the approximate locations of our permitted quarry properties as of december

we estimate our permitted proven and probable aggregate reserves to be approximately million tons with an average permitted life of approximately years at present operating levels which vary from site to site 
present operating levels are determined based on a three year annual average aggregate production rate of million tons 
reserve estimates were made by our geologists and engineers based primarily on drilling studies 
reserve estimates are based on various assumptions  and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions could have a material impact on the accuracy of our reserve estimates 
our plant equipment is powered mostly by electricity provided by local utility companies 
proven reserves are determined through the testing of samples obtained from closely spaced subsurface drilling and or exposed pit faces 
proven reserves are sufficiently understood so that quantity  quality  and engineering conditions are known with sufficient accuracy to be mined without the need for any further subsurface work 
actual required spacing is based on geologic judgment about the predictability and continuity of each deposit 
probable reserves are determined through the testing of samples obtained from subsurface drilling but the sample points are too widely spaced to allow detailed prediction of quantity  quality  and engineering conditions 
additional subsurface work may be needed prior to mining the reserve

table of contents item legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings that are pending against us and our affiliates alleging  among other things  breach of contract or tort in connection with the performance of professional services  the various outcomes of which cannot be predicted with certainty 
the most significant of these proceedings are as follows us highway project our wholly owned subsidiaries  granite construction company gcco and granite northwest  inc  are members of a joint venture known as yaquina river constructors yrc which was contracted by the oregon department of transportation odot to construct a new road alignment of us highway near eddyville  oregon 
during the fall and winter of  extraordinary rain events produced runoff that overwhelmed installed erosion control measures and resulted in discharges to surface water and alleged violations of yrc s stormwater permit 
during  odot and yrc reached a settlement agreement that ended yrc s responsibility to construct the project 
also during  yrc  gcco  the united states environmental protection agency and the us department of justice doj entered into a consent decree  which provides for a civil penalty payment after entry of the decree by the court and environmental monitoring by gcco of certain oregon projects 
this matter has not and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity 
investigation related to grand avenue project disadvantaged business enterprise dbe issues on march   the us department of transportation  office of inspector general served upon our wholly owned subsidiary  granite construction northeast  inc granite northeast  a united states district court eastern district of new york grand jury subpoena to produce documents 
the subpoena sought all documents pertaining to the use of a dbe firm the subcontractor  and the subcontractor s use of a non dbe lower tier subcontractor consultant  on the grand avenue bus depot and central maintenance facility for the borough of queens project the grand avenue project  a granite northeast project 
the subpoena sought any documents regarding the use of the subcontractor as a dbe on any other projects and any other documents related to the subcontractor or to the lower tier subcontractor consultant 
granite northeast produced the requested documents  together with other requested information 
subsequently  granite northeast was informed by the doj that it is a subject of the investigation  along with others 
in january  granite northeast met with assistant united states attorneys from the doj  along with other federal and state agents the agencies  to discuss the status of the government s criminal investigation of the grand avenue project participants  including granite northeast 
in addition to the documents produced in response to the grand jury subpoena  granite northeast is in the process of providing information to the doj concerning other projects for which granite northeast has claimed dbe credit 
granite northeast is fully cooperating with the agencies investigation 
we cannot  however  rule out the possibility of actions being brought against granite northeast which could result in civil  criminal  and or administrative penalties or sanctions 
beyond the amount accrued for this matter  granite is unable to estimate at this time any additional losses that may be reasonably probable 
however  under certain circumstances the resolution of the matters under investigation could have direct or indirect consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
other legal proceedings government inquiries we are a party to a number of other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
from time to time  we also receive inquiries from public agencies seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and related laws and regulations 
we believe that the nature and number of these proceedings and compliance inquiries are typical for a construction firm of our size and scope 
our litigation typically involves claims regarding public liability or contract related issues 
while management currently believes  after consultation with counsel  that the ultimate outcome of pending proceedings and compliance inquiries  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
were one or more unfavorable rulings to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and or liquidity for the period in which the ruling occurs 
in addition  our government contracts could be terminated  we could be suspended or debarred  or payment of our costs disallowed 
while any one of our pending legal proceedings is subject to early resolution as a result of our ongoing efforts to settle  whether or when any legal proceeding will be resolved through settlement is neither predictable nor guaranteed 
we record amounts in our consolidated balance sheets representing our estimated liability relating to legal proceedings and government inquiries 
during the years ended december  and  there were no significant additions or revisions to the estimated liability that were recorded in our consolidated statements of operations  or significant changes to our accrual for such litigation loss contingencies on our consolidated balance sheets

prior years have been adjusted to conform to this new standard 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the acquisition of kenny construction company are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are one of the largest diversified heavy civil contractors and construction materials producers in the united states  engaged in the construction and improvement of streets  roads  highways  mass transit facilities  airport infrastructure  bridges  trenchless and underground utilities  electrical utilities  tunnels  dams and other infrastructure related projects 
we own aggregate reserves and plant facilities to produce construction materials for use in our construction business and for sale to third parties 
we also operate a real estate investment and development company 
our permanent offices are located in alaska  arizona  california  colorado  florida  illinois  nevada  new york  pennsylvania  texas  utah and washington 
our construction contracts are obtained through competitive bidding in response to solicitations by both public agencies and private parties and on a negotiated basis as a result of solicitations from private parties 
project owners use a variety of methods to make contractors aware of new projects  including posting bidding opportunities on agency websites  disclosing long term infrastructure plans  advertising and other general solicitations 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as the nature and volume of advertising and other solicitations  contract backlog  available personnel  current utilization of equipment and other resources  our ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
our contract review process includes identifying risks and opportunities during the bidding process and managing these risks through mitigation efforts such as insurance and pricing 
contracts fitting certain criteria of size and complexity are reviewed by various levels of management and  in some cases  by the executive committee of our board of directors 
bidding activity  contract backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
our typical construction project begins with the preparation and submission of a bid to a customer 
if selected as the successful bidder  we generally enter into a contract with the customer that provides for payment upon completion of specified work or units of work as identified in the contract 
we usually invoice our customers on a monthly basis 
our contracts frequently call for retention that is a specified percentage withheld from each payment until the contract is completed and the work accepted by the customer 
additionally  we defer recognition of profit on projects until they reach at least completion see revenue and earnings recognition for construction contracts under critical accounting policies and estimates and our profit recognition is based on estimates that change over time 
our revenue  gross margin and cash flows can differ significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors including the projects stage of completion  the mix of early and late stage projects  our estimates of contract costs and the payment terms of our contracts 
the timing differences between our cash inflows and outflows require us to maintain adequate levels of working capital 
the four primary economic drivers of our business are the overall health of the economy  federal  state and local public funding levels  population growth resulting in public and private development  and the need to replace or repair aging infrastructure 
a stagnant or declining economy will generally result in reduced demand for construction and construction materials in the private sector 
this reduced demand increases competition for private sector projects and will ultimately also increase competition in the public sector as companies migrate from bidding on scarce private sector work to projects in the public sector 
greater competition can reduce our revenues and or have a downward impact on our gross profit margins 
in addition  a stagnant or declining economy tends to produce less tax revenue for public agencies  thereby decreasing a source of funds available for spending on public infrastructure improvements 
some funding sources that have been specifically earmarked for infrastructure spending  such as diesel and gasoline taxes  are not as directly affected by a stagnant or declining economy  unless actual consumption is reduced 
however  even these can be temporarily at risk as state and local governments take actions to balance their budgets 
additionally  high fuel prices can have a dampening effect on consumption  resulting in overall lower tax revenue 
conversely  increased levels of public funding as well as an expanding or robust economy will generally increase demand for our services and provide opportunities for revenue growth and margin improvement 

table of contents in december  we purchased of the outstanding stock of kenny construction company  a northbrook  illinois based national contractor and construction manager  for a purchase price of million  subject to possible post closing adjustments 
this acquisition expands our presence in the power  tunnel and underground markets  and enables us to leverage our capabilities and geographic footprint 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in october  we announced our enterprise improvement plan which includes continued actions to reduce our cost structure  enhance operating efficiencies and strengthen our business to achieve long term profitable growth 
the enterprise improvement plan includes new business plans to orderly divest of our real estate investment business and certain fixed assets consistent with our business strategy to focus on our core business 
as a result of the enterprise improvement plan  we incurred restructuring charges related to workforce reductions as well as real estate and fixed asset impairments 
the majority of restructuring charges associated with the enterprise improvement plan were recorded in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and restructuring charges below for further information 
our market sector information reflects four groups defined as follows california  northwest  which primarily includes our offices in alaska  nevada  utah and washington  east  which primarily includes our offices in arizona  florida  new york and texas  and kenny  which primarily includes our offices in colorado  illinois and pennsylvania 
each of these groups includes operations from our construction and large project construction lines of business
