c ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest expense  interest income  income tax benefit provision  and depreciation  amortization and impairment 
adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting ebitda for certain items that we believe are non cash or non operational  consisting of i cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  ii debt refinancing costs  iii loss from unconsolidated ventures  iv minority interests  and v other income expense  net 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow data  a measure of liquidity or an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with gaap 

table of contents ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because they are widely used by security analysts  creditors  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
this information is a material component of certain financial covenants in debt obligations 
failure to comply with the financial covenants could result in the imposition of restrictions on our financial flexibility 
when viewed with gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe the ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculation provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt and meet our ongoing liquidity requirements 
ebitda is also a financial metric used by management as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations 
however  because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies or comparable for other purposes 
also  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as non gaap financial measures  have material limitations as compared to cash flow provided by operating activities 
ebitda does not reflect the future payments for capital expenditures  financing related charges and deferred income taxes that may be required as normal business operations 
management compensates for these limitations by using our gaap results to supplement the ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands net income loss interest expense interest income income tax provision benefit depreciation  amortization and impairment ebitda adjustments other adjusted ebitda includes foreign currency transaction adjustments and loss on extinguishment of debt
