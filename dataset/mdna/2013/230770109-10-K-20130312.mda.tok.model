our business development team identifies  evaluates and negotiates product acquisition  in licensing and out licensing opportunities 
our product development team develops proprietary product formulations  manages our clinical trials  prepares all regulatory submissions and manages our medical call center 
our quality and manufacturing professionals oversee the manufacture of our products 
our marketing and sales professionals are responsible for our commercial activities  and we work closely with our third party distribution partners to ensure availability and delivery of our products 
we have been profitable since  with annual revenues funding our development and marketing programs and generating positive cash flow 
in  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock  and listed on the nasdaq exchange 
the following is a summary of our highlights and recent developments 
for more information  please see part i  item i  business  of this form k 
in  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for acetadote and caldolor with harbin gloria pharmaceuticals co  ltd  a chinese pharmaceutical company that has expertise in developing  registering  manufacturing and commercializing products in the china market 
we extended our international reach of caldolor into both canada and australia 
through cet  we expanded our collaborations on early stage drug development activities 
cet partners with universities and other research organizations to develop promising  early stage product candidates  and cumberland has the opportunity to negotiate rights to further develop and commercialize them 
including an expansion of our laboratory footprint 
we recently completed a pediatric pain study of patients 
patients receiving intravenous ibuprofen demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of postoperative doses and total amount of fentanyl required after surgery 
we recently completed two caldolor registry studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of caldolor when administered over a shortened infusion time in treating pain and fever in adult patients 
the studies involved patients at medical sites throughout the us we continued our international expansion in late and finalized agreements to commercialize caldolor with soho indistri pharmas in indonesia and sandor medicaids pvt 
ltd  in india 
the uspto issued the acetadote patent which is assigned to us and is scheduled to expire in may following the issuance of the acetadote patent  we received paragraph iv certification notices from innopharma  inc  paddock laboratories  llc  mylan institutional llc  sagent agila llc and perrigo company challenging the acetadote patent 
we responded by filing five separate infringement lawsuits 
further  on november   we brought suit against the fda alleging that the fda denial of our citizen petition  which requested that the fda refrain from approving any applications for acetylcysteine injection containing edta  and acceptance for review and approval of any innopharma  inc product containing edta was arbitrary and in violation of law 
we have settled the litigation with paddock laboratories  llc and perrigo company while the remaining lawsuits are still pending 
on november   we received a notice of allowance from the uspto for the second acetadote patent  which is set to expire in august in november  we implemented a realignment of our national sales organization to more efficiently cover key targets in support of our three marketed products 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on past experience and on other factors we deem reasonable given the circumstances 
past results help form the basis of our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not determined from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are most critical with respect to our accounting for revenue recognition  marketable securities  inventory  intangible assets  research and development accounting  provision for income taxes and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
together  sab  and topic of the accounting standards codification 
our revenue is derived primarily from the product sales of acetadote  caldolor and kristalose 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred upon either shipment of the product or arrival at its destination based on the shipping terms of the transaction 
when these conditions are satisfied  we recognize gross product revenue  which is the price we charge generally to our wholesalers for a particular product 
other income  which is a component of net revenues  includes upfront payments under licensing agreements along with grant and rental income 
other income was less than two percent of net revenues in  less than one percent in  and less than three percent in our net product revenue reflects the reduction of gross product revenue at the time of initial sales recognition for estimated accounts receivable allowances for chargebacks  cash discounts and damaged product as well as provisions for sales related accruals of rebates  product returns and administrative fees and fee for services 
our financial statements reflect accounts receivable allowances of million at both december  and  for chargebacks  discounts and allowances for product damaged in shipment 
the following table reflects our sales related accrual activity for the periods indicated below balance  january current provision current provision for prior period sales actual product returns and credits issued balance  december the allowances for chargebacks  discounts  and damaged products and sales related accruals for rebates and product returns are determined on a product by product basis and are established by management as our best estimate at the time of sale based on each product s historical experience  adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances and accruals 
additionally  these allowances and accruals are established based on the following the contractual terms with customers  analysis of historical levels of discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates  communications with customers  purchased information about the rate of prescriptions being written and the level of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  if known  and expectations about the market for each product  including any anticipated introduction of competitive products 
the allowances for chargebacks and accruals for rebates and product returns are the most significant estimates used in the recognition of our revenue from product sales 
of the accounts receivable allowances and our sales related accruals  our accrual for fee for services and product returns represents the majority of the balance 
sales related accrued liabilities for rebates  product returns  service fees  and administrative fees totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  our estimated liability for fee for services represented million  million and million  respectively  while our accrual for product returns totaled million  million and million  respectively 
if the actual amount of cash discounts  chargebacks  rebates  and product returns differs from the amounts estimated by management  material differences may result from the amount of our revenue recognized from product sales 
a change in our rebate estimate of one percentage point would have impacted net sales by approximately million in each of the three years ended december  a change in our product return estimate of one percentage point would have impacted net sales by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a general rule  we do not allow customers to purchase additional product prior to a scheduled price increase 
we occasionally make an exception to this policy when we offer odd lot quantities at a slightly reduced price or when a customer opens a new facility and requests special terms on its initial purchase 
to date  we believe these types of transactions have not been material 
moreover  when we offer special terms  we review the transaction against our revenue recognition policy for proper treatment 
if we determine such transactions have become material  we will disclose the impact in the notes to our financial statements 
while we do not have regular access to our customers inventory levels  we review each order from all of our customers 
to the extent that an order reflects more than a normal purchasing pattern  management discusses the order with the customer prior to agreeing to process the order 
fair value of marketable securities we invest in variable rate demand notes and a portfolio of government backed securities including us treasuries  government sponsored enterprise debentures and government sponsored adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  in order to maximize our return on cash 
we classify these investments as trading securities  and mark the investments to fair value at the end of each reporting period  with the adjustment being recognized in the statement of income as a component of interest income 
these investments are generally valued using observable market prices by third party pricing services  or are derived from such services pricing models 
the level of management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments for which there is a quoted price in an active market is minimal 
similarly there is little subjectivity or judgment required for instruments valued using valuation models that are standard across the industry and where all parameter inputs are quoted in active markets 
inputs to the models may include  but are not limited to  reported trades  executable bid and ask prices  broker dealer quotations  prices or yields of securities with similar characteristics  benchmark curves or information pertaining to the issuer  as well as industry and economic events 
the pricing services may use a matrix approach  which considers information regarding securities with similar characteristics to determine the valuation for a security 
inventories we record amounts for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about remaining shelf life  future demand and market conditions 
the estimated inventory obsolescence amounts are calculated based upon specific review of the inventory expiration dates and the quantity on hand at december  in comparison to our expected inventory usage 
the amount of actual inventory obsolescence and unmarketable inventory could differ either higher or lower in the near term from the estimated amounts 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
income taxes we provide for deferred taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
our principal differences are related to the timing of deductibility of certain items such as depreciation  amortization and expense for options issued to nonemployees 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using management s estimate of tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management believes those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options is recognized when the benefit is used to offset income taxes payable 
as of december   we have unrecognized federal net operating loss carryforwards associated with the exercise of nonqualified options of million 
share based payments we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
in addition  incremental compensation expense is recognized upon the modification  cancellation or repurchase of equity awards 
the fair value of stock options and warrants are calculated using the black scholes option pricing model on the date of grant 
we estimate volatility in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering and  therefore  a lack of company specific historical or implied volatility data  we have determined the share price volatility based on an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that we consider to be our peers 
the comparable peer companies used for our estimated volatility are publicly traded companies with operations which we believe to be similar to ours 
when identifying companies as peers  we consider such characteristics as the type of industry  size and or type of product s  research and or product development capabilities  and stock based transactions 
we intend to continue to consistently estimate our volatility to value stock options in this manner until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of our own shares becomes available  or circumstances change such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us 
in this latter case  we would utilize other similar entities whose share prices are publicly available 
we estimate the expected life of employee share options based on the simplified method allowed by sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
under this approach  the expected term is presumed to be the average between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term 
the expected term for options granted to non employees is generally the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury note  stripped principal  on the date of grant with a term substantially equal to the corresponding option s expected term 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends nor do we plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
during  we began issuing restricted stock awards at no cost in lieu of stock options to employees  directors and consultants 
compensation expense for restricted stock granted to employees and directors is generally equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
if a sufficient disincentive for nonperformance does not exist at the date of grant  the compensation cost is remeasured at each reporting date at the then current fair market value of the underlying common stock until the award vests 
in the second quarter of  we implemented an option exchange program the exchange program whereby certain outstanding stock options could be exchanged for shares of restricted stock 
the exchange program was designed to provide a value for value exchange of equity instruments 
the fair value of each exchanged option was determined on the date the exchange program commenced using the black scholes option fair value model 
the company did not grant any stock options during and the following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of employee and non employee options granted during as well as the exchange program in exchange program employee options non employee options dividend yield expected term years expected volatility risk free interest rate research and development we accrue for and expense research and development costs based on estimates of work performed  patient enrollment or fixed fee for services 
as work is performed and or invoices are received  we adjust our estimates and accruals 
to date  our accruals have been within our estimates 
total research and development costs are a function of studies being conducted and will increase or decrease based on the level of activity in any particular year 
intangible assets intangible assets include product rights  license agreements and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of our intangible assets  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including quoted market prices  third party independent appraisals and discounted cash flow models  as considered necessary 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net product revenues 
net product revenue decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in acetadote revenue of million  offset by the positive impact of both increased kristalose revenue of million and increased caldolor revenue of million 
the decrease in acetadote revenue was primarily driven by lower volumes of acetadote sales  especially in comparison to where we experienced a increase over volumes 
the increase in volumes during was due in part to our introduction of the new formulation of acetadote 
the formulation is free of edta and other stabilization and chelating agents and is also preservative free 
the new formulation of acetadote has been well received in the market  and continues to be the treatment of choice for acetaminophen overdose 
additionally  acetadote revenue was positively impacted by the shortage of the oral form of n acetylcysteine due to manufacturing delays 
during  the volume decline was partially offset by the impact of increases in the average selling price 
during  acetadote product revenue was positively impacted by million in sales under our product licensing agreement with perrigo for our authorized generic product 
the increase in kristalose net revenue was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of the g and g packets  with a small increase in overall sales volumes 
the increase in caldolor revenue was due to increased volume 
gross product revenue for caldolor increased million in as compared to the increase in revenue and gross revenue was primarily due to increased volume associated with continued success in penetrating our target market 
we have continued to focus more of our sales and marketing resources to driving pull through use of caldolor in facilities stocking the product 
in the fourth quarter of  we notified our wholesalers that we discontinued the mg offering of caldolor in the united states and concentrate our sales efforts on mg 
as a result  during  we recognized additional expense amounts for potential returns related to the mg product  of which a majority was related to sales in prior years 
other revenue 
other revenue increased million in as compared to the increase was primarily a result of an upfront payment we received in connection with an out licensing agreement with our commercial partner in china  harbin gloria pharmaceuticals 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in to in the decrease is primarily due to a change in product mix 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense totaled million in  representing a decrease of million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreases in royalty expenses and employee related expenses for recruitment  travel and training  partially offset by increased costs incurred as a result of the realignment of our sales force of million 
research and development 
research and development expense totaled million in  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase consisted of a million increase in salaries and hiring expense due to the expansion of our research and development team  mostly offset by million in decreased expenses for studies and lower consulting expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense totaled million in  representing a decrease of million  or  over the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in charitable donations of inventory partially offset by increased legal and printing costs associated with our stock option exchange program during interest income 
interest income totaled million in as compared to million in  representing an increase of million due primarily to the investment of a portion of our cash balances in longer duration marketable securities beginning in the first quarter of interest expense 
interest expense totaled million in  representing a decrease of million or over this decrease was due to the early payoff of our term debt in income tax expense 
as a percentage of income before income taxes  the effective tax rate decreased from in to in the decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in related to the recognition of a deferred tax benefit associated with the option exchange program during the second quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net product revenues 
net product revenue increased million  or  in as compared to net product revenue increased million for acetadote  which was partially offset by a decreases in kristalose revenue of million and caldolor of million 
an increase in volume of approximately and an increase in the average selling price contributed to the increase in acetadote revenue 
in early  we introduced the new formulation of acetadote that is free of edta or other stabilization and chelating agents and is preservative free 
the new formulation of acetadote has been well received in the market  and continues to be the treatment of choice for acetaminophen overdose 
additionally  acetadote revenue was positively impacted by the shortage of the oral form of n acetylcysteine due to manufacturing delays 
the decrease in kristalose net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in volume  partially offset by an increase in the average selling price 
during  we experienced manufacturing delays caused by a change in ownership of the plant that produces kristalose 
as previously noted  we acquired the full rights to kristalose in and believe this will help alleviate some of the manufacturing delays we experienced in gross product revenue for caldolor increased million in as compared to the increase in gross revenue was primarily due to increased volume as we continue to penetrate our target market 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we initiated a shift in focus and began transitioning part of our sales and marketing resources to driving pull through use of caldolor in facilities stocking the product 
in the fourth quarter of  we notified our wholesalers that we were discontinuing the mg offering of caldolor and concentrating our sales efforts on mg 
as a result  we recognized a reserve for potential returns related to the mg product  of which a majority was related to sales in prior years 
the result of this reserve plus the normal sales allowances resulted in a decrease in net product revenue of million 
other revenue 
other revenue decreased million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of million of federal grant funding from the qualifying therapeutic discovery project  a component of the healthcare reform legislation enacted in this program was not available in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenues increased from in to in the increase was primarily due to the recognition of million of inventory write downs during for potentially obsolete inventory 
excluding this charge  cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenues would have been 
this decrease was primarily due to the change in our sales mix in the periods 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense totaled approximately million in  representing a decrease of million  or  over the decrease was primarily due a decrease in royalty expense as a result of the acetadote royalty agreement which expired in january  decrease in sales force and related expenses and savings associated with bringing the field sales force in house  rather than outsourcing 
these decreases were partially offset by increased marketing and advertising expense due to significant investments made in marketing the new formulation of acetadote and enhancing the brand message 
research and development 
research and development expense totaled million in  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs as we expanded our research and development team and increased annual product and establishment fees from the fda for our products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense totaled million in  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase was primarily due to increased charitable contributions as we donated inventory for humanitarian needs  increased travel expenses as we continued to expand our products world wide and increased consulting and personnel costs 
interest expense 
interest expense totaled million in  representing a decrease of million  or  over the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the payoff of our term debt in july and lower interest rates as a result of modifying our line of credit agreement 
in august  we amended our debt agreement to provide up to million of availability under our line of credit  with the option of increasing it to million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
as a result of amending our debt agreement  we were able to reduce the interest cost through the term of the line of credit facility december  
income tax expense 
as a percentage of income before income taxes  the tax rate decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily due to an increase in pretax income without a corresponding increase in the nature and amount of permanent differences and the effects of the therapeutic discovery tax credit in as previously noted  we received million of federal tax grants in  which represented of the eligible expenses 
the full amount of the eligible expenses was not deductible for federal income purposes 
the therapeutic discovery tax credit was not available in liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations  our availability under our line of credit and the cash proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock that was completed in august for the years ended december   and  we generated million  million and million in cash flow from operations  respectively 
we believe that our internally generated cash flows and amounts available under our line of credit will be adequate to service existing debt  finance internal growth and fund capital expenditures 
in  we began investing a portion of our cash reserves in variable rate demand notes and a portfolio of government backed securities including us treasuries  government sponsored enterprise debentures and government sponsored adjustable rate  mortgage backed securities 
the variable rate demand notes  or vrdns  are generally issued by municipal governments and are backed by a financial institution letter of credit 
we hold a put right on the vrdns  which allows us to liquidate the investments relatively quickly less than one week 
the government backed securities have an active secondary market that generally provides for liquidity in less than one week 
at december   we had a total of approximately million invested in marketable securities 
as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents  including marketable securities  totaled million and million  respectively 
our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million and million  respectively  and our current ratio current assets to current liabilities was x and x  respectively 
as of december   we also had approximately million available on our line of credit 
the following table summarizes our net changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents the sum of the individual amounts may not agree due to rounding 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the previously noted investment of our cash reserves in government and government backed securities which are reflected as a net use of cash in investing activities of million 
our cash flows from operating activities were primarily due to the million in net income for the year supplemented by cash inflows from our receivables 
in addition  our financing activities included the repurchase of common stock of million in connection with our share repurchase program discussed in part ii  item  market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  of this form k 
during  we recognized approximately million of excess tax benefits 
the excess tax benefit represents the income taxes that would have been paid if not for the tax deductions created upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to cash generated from our operating activities 
our net income increased from million in to million in the increase in cash and cash equivalents from operating activities was offset by increased purchases of fixed assets and intangibles of million and cash used in financing activities of million 
during  we paid in full our term debt facility of million 
in connection with the termination of the term debt facility  we increased our borrowings under our line of credit by million 
in addition  our financing activities included the repurchase of common stock of million in connection with our share repurchase program discussed above 
during  we recognized approximately million of excess tax benefits 
the excess tax benefit represents the income taxes that would have been paid if not for the tax deductions created upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for year ended december  was primarily due to cash used in financing activities  which included principal payments on our term debt of million and the repurchase of common stock of approximately million 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately million and the excess tax benefit derived from the exercise of non qualified options of approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to net income for the period and the collection of accounts receivable offset by the purchase of inventory 
in july  we paid in full the outstanding term debt balance 
in august  we entered into a fifth amended and restated loan agreement with our primary lender the agreement to provide for an increase in the line of credit to million 
the credit facility may be increased up to million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the interest rate is the bba libor daily floating rate plus an applicable margin  as those terms are defined in the agreement at december  
in addition  a commitment fee of per annum is charged on the unused line of credit 
the credit facility was extended to expire on december   at which time all principal amounts are due and payable 
interest is payable quarterly 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
we are no longer required to maintain minimum deposits with the lender the amendment includes certain financial and restrictive covenants  all of which we are in compliance with 
our manufacturing and supply agreement with one manufacturer  which expires in  contains a minimum annual purchase obligation 
we expect our normal inventory purchasing levels to be above the required minimum amounts 
as of december   we had met our purchase obligations for under this agreement 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by year contractual obligations total in thousands amounts reflected in the balance sheet line of credit estimated interest on debt other cash obligations not reflected on the balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total the table of contractual obligations excludes amounts due under the kristalose purchase agreement as these amounts can not be determined until sales of the product have occurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our cash on deposit in highly liquid money market accounts and revolving credit facility 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the main objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing interest income through low risk investments 
our investment policy focuses on principal preservation and liquidity 
we believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash and cash equivalents is not material 
the risk related to interest rates for these accounts would produce less income than expected if market interest rates fall 
based on current interest rates  we do not believe we are exposed to significant downside risk related to a change in interest on our money market accounts 
in the first quarter of  we analyzed our return on our investments and determined investing in variable rate demand notes and a portfolio of government backed securities including us treasuries  government sponsored enterprise debentures and government sponsored adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  would yield a higher return with minimal additional risk 
the variable rate demand notes  or vrdns  are generally issued by municipal governments and are backed by a financial institution letter of credit 
we hold a put right on the vrdn  which allows us to liquidate the investment relatively quickly less than one week 
the government backed securities have an active secondary market that generally provides for liquidity in less than one week 
the risk related to interest rates for these accounts will produce less income than expected if market interest rates fall 
based on the million in marketable securities a decrease in the fair value of the securities would result in a reduction in pretax net income of million 
based on current interest rates  we do not believe we are exposed to significant downside risk related to change in interest on our investment accounts 
the interest rate risk related to borrowings under our line of credit is a variable rate of libor plus an applicable margin  as defined in the loan agreement at december  
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our line of credit 
if interest rates increased by  the impact on interest expense in future periods would be less than million 
we have sufficient cash balances to pay down the line of credit to minimize our interest rate exposure 
exchange rate risk while we operate primarily in the us  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
a portion of our research and development is performed abroad 
currently  we do not utilize financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
we believe our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is minimal as our purchases in foreign currency have a maximum exposure of days based on invoice terms with a portion of the exposure being limited to days based on the due date of the invoice 
foreign currency exchange losses were immaterial for  and neither a five percent increase nor decrease from current exchange rates would have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
