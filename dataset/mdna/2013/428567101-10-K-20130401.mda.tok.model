risk factors 
overview note all references to comparable store sales in fiscal refer to the week comparison to fiscal without consideration of the rd week in fiscal all other fiscal financial information includes the full week period 
hibbett sports  inc operates sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets  predominantly in the south  southwest  mid atlantic and midwest regions of the united states 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of quality brand name merchandise and a high level of customer service 
as of february   we operated a total of retail stores in states composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and sports co 
superstore 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  an approximately  square foot store located primarily in strip centers  which are frequently influenced by a wal mart store 
approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in strip centers  which includes free standing stores  while approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in enclosed malls 
over the last several years  we have concentrated and expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal the volatile economic conditions have shown signs of improvement in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  and we have experienced an increase in comparable store and total net sales 
we were able to further enhance net income through continued effective management of expenses 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  footwear and apparel experienced strong comparable store sales gains 
in fiscal  accessory sales experienced a double digit comparable store sales increase led by footwear accessories while footwear and activewear experienced high single digit comparable store sales increases 
we historically have had increases in comparable store net sales in the low to mid single digit range 
fiscal experienced a total company wide square footage increase of 
our plan for fiscal is to increase total company wide square footage by to  which is at the lower end of our historical range of to but an improvement from the last three fiscal year square footage increases 
to supplement new store openings  we continue to expand high performing stores  increasing the square footage in existing stores in fiscal generally  our expansions involve an increase in square footage of to 
we expect to expand an additional stores in fiscal total comparable store sales percentage growth is expected to be in the low to mid single digits in fiscal over the past several years  we have increased our gross profit through improved local assortments  fewer retail price reductions and increased efficiencies in logistics 
we expect a slight improvement in gross profit rate in fiscal as we continue to benefit from increased efficiencies from our investment in systems 
we also expect merchandise margin improvement to increase due to the implementation of our markdown optimization system beginning after fiscal in fiscal  we began construction on a new wholesaling and logistics facility to support our expected growth over the next several years with an expected operations date in mid fiscal the expected total cost of the new facility is estimated at approximately million 
although the macroeconomic environment has presented many challenges in the last three years  our management believes that our business fundamentals remain strong and that we are well positioned for the future 
we are a leader in smaller markets and will continue to benefit from our comparatively low operating costs compared to our competitors 
we continue to manage our costs and inventories prudently as dictated by the current economic environment  and we intend to continue to invest in initiatives to prepare our infrastructure for continued long term growth 
due to our increased net sales  we have historically leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
based on projected net sales  we expect operating  selling and administrative rates to increase slightly in fiscal  primarily due to the rd week benefit in fiscal and one time expenses associated with our new corporate headquarters 
we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base  to provide capital expenditures for our wholesaling and logistics facility  technology upgrade projects and to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
we utilize a merchandise management system that allows us to identify and monitor trends 
however  this system does not produce us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap financial information by product category 
therefore  it is impracticable to provide us gaap net sales by product category

we have operated as a public company and have been incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware since october  due to the rd week in fiscal  each quarter in fiscal starts one week later than the same quarter in fiscal the chart below presents comparable store sales for fiscal as originally reported and as adjusted to represent the same week period as the fiscal quarters fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year comparable store sales increase originally reported comparable store sales increase adjusted for week shift impact of week shift comparable store net sales data for the periods presented reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel  relocation or expansion results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
our sports co 
store is not and has never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september and we do not have plans to open additional superstores in the future 
executive summary following is a highlight of our financial results over the last three fiscal years fiscal weeks fiscal weeks fiscal weeks net sales in millions operating income  percentage to net sales comparable store sales increase net income in millions net income  percentage increase diluted earnings per share during fiscal  hibbett opened new stores and closed underperforming stores  bringing the store base to in states as of february  inventory on a per store basis at february  increased by primarily due to the increased volume of receipts in the rd week  however  there was an improvement in aged merchandise compared to january  hibbett ended fiscal with million of available cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and full availability under its million unsecured credit facilities

note of item of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended february   for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended february  january  january  net sales costs of goods sold  including distribution and store occupancy costs gross profit store operating  selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income note columns may not sum due to rounding 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal furthermore we opened hibbett sports stores while closing underperforming hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in fiscal stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
the rd week contributed million of the increase in net sales 
we expanded  remodeled or relocated high performing stores 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we achieved a increase in comparable store net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
during fiscal  stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
the increase in comparable store net sales was broad based with strong performances across accessories  activewear and footwear 
strong product performances were led by positive trends in footwear accessories  branded headwear  youth activewear and all categories of footwear 
basketball shoes were the highest performer in our footwear categories while our running business moderated in fiscal the majority of our comparable store sales increase was from increased sales per transaction primarily due to an assortment change mix to premium products 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for our distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal gross profit percentage improved as a percentage of net sales due to continued improvements in assortments by market  tight controls over markdowns and promotions and improved inventory shrinkage 
strong sales performance and improved aged inventory negated the need for liquidating promotions and resulted in higher initial sell through of inventory at regular prices 
we expect gross profit percentage will stabilize in fiscal due to the significant expansion over the last three years and historically low inventory shrinkage rates 
distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased basis points resulting primarily from increases in data processing  third party services and labor expenses 
in fiscal  we initiated broadband service in the majority of our stores and experienced its full cost impact in fiscal we also experienced an increase in freight costs due to higher gas prices 
we expect to see increases in this cost component into fiscal based on current trends 
store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points due to strong sales and careful management of occupancy costs 
the largest decrease as a percent to net sales was rent expense as we continue to experience rent savings through lease renegotiations and from co tenancy violations by our landlords  offset somewhat by a decrease in construction allowances 
we expect to continue to experience rent savings through lease renegotiations into fiscal store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal expense trends we experienced included total salary expense increased in dollars due to company growth and annual pay rate increases but decreased basis points as a percentage of net sales due to strong sales results 
salary costs in our stores decreased basis points as a percentage of net sales 
as our store base grows  we expect an increase in salary and benefit dollars  but believe these costs as a percentage to net sales will remain relatively stable 
credit card fees decreased basis points as a percentage of net sales resulting from lower debit card transaction fees 
we expect these fees to increase in dollars with net sales growth  but stabilize or increase slightly as a percentage of net sales in fiscal stock based compensation decreased by basis points as a percentage of net sales due to the achievement of certain performance awards at less than the rate of those achieved in the prior year 
we also experienced a larger than average forfeiture of restricted stock units compared to prior year 
expenses associated with preparing our new corporate headquarters contributed an increase of basis points as a percentage of net sales 
we expect these costs will increase in fiscal as we finalize the move from our current location 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we attribute the decrease in depreciation expense as a percent of net sales to a decrease in the investment in leasehold improvements in recent years as more of the build out work is being done by landlords offset somewhat by changes in estimates of useful lives of leasehold improvements in underperforming stores 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily due to operating efficiencies achieved resulting in higher pre tax income as a percentage of net sales 
the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in rate resulted primarily from lower federal income tax credits as a result of the expiration of the work opportunity tax credit program and the resolution of an income tax matter with a state taxing authority in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal furthermore we opened hibbett sports stores and sports addition stores while closing underperforming hibbett sports stores and sports co 
stores for net stores opened of stores in fiscal stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
we expanded or remodeled high performing stores and converted sports co 
store to a hibbett sports store 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
during fiscal  stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
the increase in comparable store net sales was broad based with strong performances across footwear  equipment  apparel and accessories 
strong product performances were led by positive trends in all categories of activewear and in accessories  footwear  and licensed apparel 
lightweight running shoes were a key driver in our footwear business while kid footwear was particularly strong in fiscal the majority of our comparable store sales increase was from increased consumer traffic and somewhat from increased retail prices 
strip locations outperformed enclosed mall stores 
strip center locations comprised approximately of our total store base and included free standing store locations 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal gross profit percentage was impacted by a higher percentage of merchandise sold at regular price and fewer company wide promotions 
gross profit percentage also benefited from an improvement in inventory shrinkage year over year 
strong sales performance and improved aged inventory negated the need for liquidating promotions and more favorable discounts from vendors resulted in higher initial sell through of inventory at regular prices 
distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased basis points resulting primarily from increases in data processing third party services 
in fiscal  we initiated broadband service in over of our existing stores 
we also experienced an increase in freight costs due to higher gas prices 
store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points 
the largest decrease as a percent to net sales was rent expense as we experienced rent savings through lease renegotiations and from co tenancy violations by our landlords  offset somewhat by a decrease in construction allowances used to offset rent expense 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal expense trends we experienced included salary and benefit costs in our stores remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales  but increased in dollars  primarily from annual pay rate increases and incentive payments associated with higher sales as well as with the growth in stores 
salary and benefit costs decreased at the administrative level by basis points as a percentage of net sales primarily due to a decrease in the accrual for annual bonuses and a decrease in hospital insurance resulting from lower claims 
business insurance was lower due to lower actual claims and a decrease in casualty and workers compensation insurance premium expense 
trends of increasing credit card processing fees slowed in fiscal as we realized the benefit of lower debit card processing exchange rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal and in fiscal we attribute the decrease in depreciation expense as a percent of net sales to a decrease in the investment in leasehold improvements in recent years as more of the build out work is being done by landlords offset somewhat by changes in estimates of useful lives of leasehold improvements in some underperforming stores 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily due to operating efficiencies achieved resulting in higher pre tax income as a percentage of net sales 
the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in rate resulted primarily from an increase in employment related income tax credits and the resolution of an income tax matter with a state taxing authority 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchases and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
due to the low interest rates currently available  we are using excess cash on deposit to offset bank fees versus investing such funds in an equity market or in interest bearing deposits 
our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  such as winter holidays and back to school 
inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces a positive cash flow 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal was impacted by the following the change in accounts payable provided cash of million in fiscal  used cash of million during fiscal and provided cash of million during fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted from a purchase of inventory in advance of the coming spring season 
beginning in fiscal  we started paying some of our vendors using corporate purchasing cards  which effectively extended our payment terms by one month 
the fluctuation in cash provided by accounts payable between fiscal and fiscal resulted from the anniversary of the payment term extensions 
ending inventory was up and on a per store level basis at february  and january   respectively  compared to the prior year due primarily to a shift in product mix in advance of our strong spring selling season and  to a lesser degree  merchandise cost increases 
the increase in inventory used cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
although our inventory levels have increased at the store level over the last few years  our aged inventory has improved 
net income provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
non cash charges included depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation expense has been trending down in the last several years due to older store classes reaching full depreciation level coupled with newer stores opening at a slower pace and at a lower cost 
we expect depreciation expense will begin to increase in fiscal due to investments in facilities and information technology systems 
fluctuations in stock based compensation generally result from the achievement of performance based equity awards at greater or lesser than their granted level and fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in the fiscal periods ended february   january  and january  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
gross capital expenditures used million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we use cash in investing activities to build new stores and remodel  expand or relocate existing stores 
we opened new stores and relocated  expanded and or remodeled existing stores during fiscal we opened new stores and relocated  expanded and or remodeled existing stores during fiscal we opened new stores and relocated  expanded and or remodeled existing stores during fiscal furthermore  net cash used in investing activities includes expenditures for our new wholesaling and logistics facility and corporate headquarters and purchases of information technology assets 
we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in the fiscal year ending february  will be approximately million  which relates to expenditures for our new wholesaling and logistics facility and corporate headquarters  the opening of to new stores  the remodeling of selected existing stores  information system upgrades  and other departmental needs 
of the total budgeted dollars for capital expenditures for fiscal  we anticipate that approximately will be related to our new wholesaling and logistics facility and corporate headquarters 
approximately will be related to the opening of new stores and remodeling and or relocating of existing stores 
approximately will be related to information systems with the remaining related primarily to store fixtures  transportation equipment and automobiles and security equipment for our stores 
the lease for our existing distribution center  which also currently serves as our corporate headquarters  expires in december we expect to relocate our corporate headquarters by june at a total cost of million of which million was expended by the end of fiscal by the end of fiscal  we expect that our new wholesaling and logistics facility will be complete at a total estimated cost of million 
we had expended million by the end of fiscal our expected operations date for the new facility is mid financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the financing activity cash fluctuation between years is primarily the result of repurchases of our common stock 
we expended million  million and million on repurchases of our common stock during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
financing activities also consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of incentive stock options 
as stock options are exercised and shares are purchased through our employee stock purchase plan  we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction  however  the amounts and timing cannot be predicted 
at february   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allow borrowings up to million and million  and which renew in august and november  respectively 
the facilities do not require a commitment or agency fee nor are there any covenant restrictions 
we plan to renew these facilities as they expire and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to us 
as of february   we did not have any debt outstanding under either of these facilities 
the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to hibbett sports  inc at february  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest on capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other liabilities total see part ii
