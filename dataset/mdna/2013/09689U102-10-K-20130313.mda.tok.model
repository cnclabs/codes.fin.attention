we operate specialty apparel stores under the body central and body shop banners  as well as a direct business comprised of our body central catalog and our e commerce website at www 
bodycentral 
com also accessible under the url www

com 
we target women in their late teens and twenties from diverse cultural backgrounds  who seek the latest fashions and a flattering fit 
our stores feature an assortment of tops  dresses  bottoms  jewelry  accessories and shoes sold primarily under our exclusive body central and lipstick labels 
we continually update our merchandise and floor sets with an emphasis on coordinated outfits presented by lifestyle to give our customers a reason to shop our stores frequently 
we believe our multi channel strategy supports our brand building efforts and provides us with synergistic growth opportunities across all of our sales channels 
as of december   we had stores with an average size of approximately  square feet 
our stores are located in fashion retail venues in the south  mid atlantic and midwest 
we opened new stores and closed four stores in fiscal year how we assess the performance of our business in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of operational and financial measures 
the key measures for determining how our business is performing are net revenues  comparable store and non comparable store sales  sales per square foot  direct sales through our catalog and e commerce channels  gross profit margin  store contribution  selling  general and administrative expenses  earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization  net income  and earnings per share 
net revenues net revenues consist of sales of our merchandise from comparable stores and non comparable stores  and direct sales through our catalog and e commerce channels  including shipping and handling fees charged to our customers 
net revenues from our stores and direct business reflect sales of our merchandise less estimated returns and merchandise discounts 
store sales there may be variations in the way in which other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
we include a store in comparable store sales on the first day of the fourteenth month after a store opens 
non comparable store sales include sales not included in comparable store sales for example  the first two months of a new store sales and sales from closed stores 
measuring the change in year over year comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends  
table of contents our ability to identify and respond effectively to fashion trends and customer preferences  changes in competition  changes in our merchandise mix  changes in pricing levels and average unit price  the timing of our releases of new merchandise  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  and the number of stores we open and close in any period 
direct sales we offer direct sales through our catalogs and through our e commerce website  www 
bodycentral 
com also accessible under the url www 
bodyc 
com  which accepts orders directly from our customers 
we believe the circulation of our catalogs and access to our website increases our reputation and brand recognition with our target customers and helps support the strength of our store operations 
direct sales are not included in our comparable store sales 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our net revenues minus our cost of goods sold 
gross profit margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues 
cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise  distribution costs  all freight costs incurred to ship merchandise to our stores and our direct customers  costs incurred to produce and distribute our catalogs  store occupancy costs  buying costs and inventory shrinkage 
the components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to those of other retailers 
our cost of goods sold is greater in higher volume periods because cost of goods sold generally increases as net revenues increase 
we review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow moving merchandise and take appropriate markdowns to clear these goods 
the timing and level of markdowns are not seasonal in nature  but are driven by customer acceptance of our merchandise 
if we misjudge sales levels and or trends  we may be faced with excess inventories and be required to mark down our prices for those products in order to sell them 
significant markdowns have reduced the gross profit margin in some prior periods and may do so in the future 
as such  we record a markdown reserve based on estimates of future markdowns related to current inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in cost of goods sold 
these expenses include payroll and other expenses related to operations at our corporate headquarters and store operations 
these expenses do not generally vary proportionally with net revenues 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues are usually higher in lower volume periods and usually lower in higher volume periods 
the components of our selling  general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to those of other retailers 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth and continuing growth in our direct business 

table of contents results of operations the following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenues as well as selected non financial operating data fiscal year ended december  december  january  percentage of net revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income operating data stores comparable store sales change number of stores open at end of period sales per gross square foot in whole dollars average square feet per store total gross square feet at end of period in thousands direct number of catalogs circulated in thousands revenue per catalog in whole dollars we have determined our operating segments on the same basis that we use internally to evaluate performance 
our operating segments are our stores and our direct business  which have been aggregated into one reportable segment 
we aggregate our operating segments because they have a similar class of customer  nature of products  nature of production process and distribution methods  as well as similar economic characteristics

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is currently cash flows from operations 
our primary needs are for capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores  remodeling or relocating existing stores  distributing our catalogs  operating our website and the additional working capital required for running our operations 
cash is also required for investment in our information technology systems  maintenance of existing facilities and distribution facility enhancements  when required 
the most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  merchandise inventories  
table of contents trade payables and other current liabilities 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or  in the case of credit or debit card transactions  within several days of the related sale  and we typically have up to days to pay our merchandise vendors  depending on the applicable vendor terms 
on january   we entered into a line of credit agreement with branch banking and trust company that provides for a revolving line of credit facility in the amount of million with an accordion feature that allows branch banking and trust company to increase the facility up to million at its sole discretion 
the facility has maturity date of may  and bears interest at the one month libor rate plus per annum  as adjusted monthly on the first day of each month  with an all in floor rate of 
the facility is secured by all the assets of the company 
the line of credit agreement includes a financial covenant requiring the company to have a tangible net worth as defined in the line of credit agreement of million quarterly  and other customary covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit facility 
on march   we renewed the line of credit agreement  the facility has a maturity date of may  there were no significant changes to the terms or conditions from the original agreement dated january  our ability to fund our cash flow needs depends largely on our future operating performance 
in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of operational and financial measures 
the key measures for determining how our business is performing are net revenues  comparable store and non comparable store sales  direct sales through our catalog and e commerce channels  gross profit margin  store contribution  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased  to million as of december   as compared to million as of december  components of this change in cash in fiscal year  as well as the change in fiscal years and  are shown in the following table fiscal year ended december  december  january  in thousands provided by operating activities used in investing activities provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash cash equivalents

table of contents investing activities cash used in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for new and existing stores  as well as our investment in information technology fiscal year ended december  december  january  in thousands purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sale of assets purchases of short term investments proceeds from sales of short term investments proceeds from maturities of short term investments purchase of intangible assets net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities increased million as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in capital expenditures related to new store construction  million of purchases of short term investments  offset by million in proceeds from sales of short term investments  million of maturities of short term investments and a  purchase of a website domain name 
for fiscal year  purchases of property and equipment increased million compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for new store construction 
financing activities cash provided by used in financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from our common stock offerings  exercise of employee stock options and tax benefits from stock based award activities 
prior to our initial public offering in october  our financing activities historically consisted of borrowings and payments on our outstanding senior credit facility fiscal year ended december  december  january  in thousands principal payments on long term debt proceeds from public offering  net of issuance costs proceeds from the issuance of stock options redemption of series c preferred stock excess tax benefits from stock based compensation net cash provided by used in financing activities on february   the company completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock priced at per share 
the company sold  new shares of its common stock in the offering  and selling shareholders sold  shares of common stock in the offering which included all of the  shares sold pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option 
the 
table of contents offering raised net proceeds of million for the company  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses paid by the company 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of any shares by the selling stockholders 
on october   we completed our initial public offering of our common stock which included  new shares sold by us and  shares sold by our existing stockholders  raising net proceeds of million for us  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us 
on october   we used net proceeds of million from our initial public offering to repay the outstanding principal amount owed under our prior senior credit facility and million to redeem all outstanding shares of our non convertible  non voting series c preferred stock 
in addition  we paid million in scheduled quarterly principal repayments plus an additional million on our prior senior credit facility in fiscal year  based on our operating results for fiscal year the million use of net cash in fiscal year resulted from the scheduled quarterly principal repayments due under our prior senior credit facility 
outlook our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures associated with our growth strategy and working capital requirements 
we believe that our cash position  net cash provided by operating activities  availability under the line of credit agreement as well as net proceeds from our secondary common stock offering in february will be adequate to finance our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
planned capital expenditures for fiscal year include expenditures for approximately new stores  relocation of and maintenance of existing stores  maintenance of corporate facilities  and investments in information technology systems  which includes investing in and upgrading several of our systems to provide improved support of our current operations and position us for future growth 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations we enter into long term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  primarily operating leases 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  over the periods specified 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total represents future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases and does not include incremental rents which are computed as a percentage of net sales

table of contents the above table does not include long term debt as we did not have any direct borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  deferred compensation and deferred rent liability 
impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which amends accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income 
the amended guidance eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity  as permitted under asu no 
 we elected to present items of net income and other comprehensive income within a single note to the financial statements beginning the in first quarter of in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
this guidance is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
this update permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
this asu became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have opted for an early adoption of this asu 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic 
the amended guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the objective of this amendment is to facilitate comparability between entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of gaap and those that prepare it on the basis of ifrs 
this guidance became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu no 
requires presentation of relcassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  for those amounts required to be reclassified into net income in their entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period  cross reference to other disclosures is required 
as permitted under asu  we have elected to present reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income within a single note to the financial statements beginning the in first quarter of critical accounting policies this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been derived from our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  our 
table of contents management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  property and equipment  recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors and assumptions it believes to be reasonable to form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which would require us to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
our management has reviewed critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
the following reflect the most critical accounting policies and significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the point of sale or upon shipment to customers 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers for direct sales are included in net revenues 
based on historical sales returns  an allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of net revenues in the periods in which the sales are recognized 
sales tax collected from customers is excluded from net revenues and is included as part of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
beginning in march  we began selling gift cards in our stores  which do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold 
through june  we sold gift certificates in our stores  which also do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity 
we recognize revenue from gift cards and gift certificates when they are redeemed by the customer 
inventory valuation inventories are comprised primarily of women apparel and accessories and are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis  using the retail inventory method 
we record merchandise receipts at the time they are delivered to our merchandise consolidator as this is the point at which title and risk of loss transfer to us 
our merchandise is delivered from our vendors to the merchandise consolidator  a third party provider of consolidated freight services 
we utilize two freight consolidators  one on the west coast and one on the east coast 
we do not directly import any merchandise at this time 
we review our inventory levels to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear this merchandise 
we record a markdown reserve based on estimated future markdowns related to current inventory to clear slow moving inventory 
markdowns may occur when inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price 
these markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
the markdown reserve is recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents we perform physical inventory counts on most stores semi annually 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical physical inventory results as a percentage of sales 
the estimate for shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
property and equipment  net property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed for financial reporting purposes on the straight line method using service lives ranging principally from three to fifteen years 
furniture and fixtures are typically depreciated over three to five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided on the straight line method over the length of the lease or over the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is shorter 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
major renewals and betterments which extend service lives are capitalized  while expenditures for repairs and maintenance that do not significantly extend the life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected future cash flows 
the major components of our long lived assets are store fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements 
we follow fasb asc  property  plant and equipment  which requires an impairment analysis to be performed on long lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is performed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of related assets for the individual stores 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets based on the discounted future cash flows of the assets using a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
goodwill goodwill of million was recognized on the acquisition of body shop of america  inc  now known as body central stores  inc  and catalogue ventures  inc  and now known as body central direct  inc  on october  we follow fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which requires that goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are subject to an assessment of impairment at least annually 
under this guidance  we are required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential impairment of goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million impairment of goodwill related to our store operations as a result of the slowing economy  repositioning of our merchandise strategy  competition with retailers and operating performance of our stores 
in the fourth quarter of we early adopted the new guidance under accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other  which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment 
this new guidance provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying amount 
in the fourth quarter of the company adopted accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  that simplifies the guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value impairment of indefinite lived assets other than goodwill 
our management performed this qualitative analysis as of december  for its indefinite lived intangible assets and the goodwill associated with the store operating segment 
this 
table of contents analysis considered factors such as the year over year change in our competitive retail sector  comparable store sales  catalog sales  the company stock price  the company actual revenue in fiscal compared to management forecasted revenue in fiscal year management most recent valuation performed  our market value relative to our book value  the debt levels  the company cash from operations and the company cash balances 
the qualitative analysis further evaluated changes in the company management and our infrastructure and refinements to our strategic objectives including the replacement or addition of several key functions  and concluded that it is more likely than not that the store operating segment indefinite lived intangible assets and the goodwill assiciated with the store operating segment fair value was greater than its carrying value and therfore did not perform additional procedures associated with those assets 
the company has recently made significant investments in the direct business based on a refined approach towards customer communication channels  customer relationship management intiatives and a refined production offering 
however as operating margins in were not in line with expectations  managment elected to perform the step one analysis for assessing whether an impairment of goodwill on its direct operating segment existed and determined that an imairment did not exist because the fair market value of the direct segment was greater than the carrying value as of december  income taxes income taxes are accounted for pursuant to fasb asc  income taxes  which requires that we recognize deferred income taxes  which include net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits among other items 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities relating to nondeductible temporary differences 
recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit associated with temporary differences will be utilized 
the fasb issued guidance requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have determined that valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are not currently necessary 
we follow fasb asc  income taxes  guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns 
the standard also provides guidance for de recognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties 
in may  the fasb amended the guidance associated with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit 
we did not have any uncertain tax provisions recorded in our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value and is recognized as an expense by the graded vested method over the employee requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
as required under this guidance  we estimate forfeitures for options granted which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of our stock based compensation expense 
the weighted average grant date fair value of options was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we estimate the grant date fair value of stock 
table of contents option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
for fiscal years  and  the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions fiscal year ended december  december  january  expected option term years years years expected volatility factor risk free interest rate expected annual dividend yield since there was not sufficient historical information for grants with similar terms  the simplified or plain vanilla method of estimating option life was utilized 
the stock volatility for each grant is measured using the weighted average of historical weekly price changes of certain peer companies common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected option life of the grant 
we use peer companies volatility because we have been public less than two years and our expected term is over six years 
these peer companies represent other publicly traded retailers in the female fashion segment 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the expected term of the share option is based on the rate of us treasury securities with the same term as the option as of the grant date 
the risk free interest rate was determined based on the rate of us treasury instruments whose maturities are similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued 
the expected dividend yield was based on our expectations of not paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the expected volatility incorporates historical volatility of similar entities whose shares prices are publicly available 
the expected term is based on the simplified method of estimating the option life 
on march   our board of directors approved  subject to stockholder approval  an amendment and restatement of our amended and restated equity plan the plan 
on may   our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement to the plan 
the amended and restated plan permits up to  of the remaining shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of march  under the plan to be issued in the form of restricted stock awards and allows certain awards under the plan to qualify as performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code of  if the compensation committee of our board of directors chooses to qualify the awards in other respects 
for long term incentives  our board of directors established an annual equity grant protocol that resulted in an initial grant effective as of september  and a subsequent grant effective 
as of april  the committee initial long term incentive awards granted to certain executives were roughly two thirds stock options and one third time vested restricted stock
