results of operations overview the company recorded net income of  for compared to net income of  in the improvement in net income over the prior year was largely due to a lower provision for loan losses and a decrease in noninterest expense 
the provision for loan losses in was  down  from the  recorded in this decline in the provision for loan losses was due to significantly lower net loan charge offs  a reduction in classified assets  and reductions in nonperforming assets 
noninterest expense for the year was  a  or percent decrease from the decline in noninterest expense was due to lower fdic insurance assessments  reduced costs associated with problem assets  specifically legal fees and collection costs related to problem loans  and other real estate expenses  particularly valuation write downs on other real estate owned 

table of contents for the year  the company recorded net income of  compared to net income of  in the improvement in net income over the prior year was due to increased operating revenues and a lower provision for loan losses 
improvement in these two areas was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense 
improvement in operating revenue was primarily the result of a  increase in noninterest income 
an increase in gains on the sale of securities including otti recorded accounted for  of the total improvement in noninterest income 
the provision for loan losses in was  down  from the  recorded in this decline in the provision for loan losses was due to a significant reduction in classified assets combined with reductions in nonperforming assets 
noninterest expense for the year was  a  or percent increase over the increase in noninterest expense was due to higher costs associated with problem assets  specifically legal fees related to problem loans  other real estate expenses  particularly valuation write downs on other real estate owned  and repossession and collection expense 
year end assets at december   were  up  or percent from december   asset totals 
growth in assets was due to an increase in the securities portfolio of  combined with an increase in outstanding net loans of  the company experienced a more typical seasonal core deposit pattern with deposit outflows occurring during the first half of the year followed by growth in core deposits during the second half of the year 
outstanding core deposits were  at december   up  or percent over the prior year end 
growth in the company s demand deposits accounted for virtually all of the increase in core deposits as demand deposits at december  of  were up  or percent over december  average assets for the year were  up  over  due to growth in average securities and investments 
average loans for the year were relatively flat when compared with as the majority of the loan growth occurred in the th quarter 
average core deposits for the year were  relatively flat when compared with average core deposits for during  the company believes the following factors could impact reported financial results the recent tax increase on all american workers and probable reduction in federal government spending that could affect national  regional  and local economies and negatively affect loan demand  the credit quality of existing clients with lending relationships  unemployment rates  and vacancy rates of commercial real estate properties 
changes and volatility in interest rates could negatively impacting yields on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  thus negatively affecting the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
the availability of low cost wholesale funding sources due to disruption in the financial and capital markets 
the ability to manage noninterest expense growth in light of anticipated increases in regulatory expenses 
potential expenses related to other real estate owned  specifically valuation write downs 
the ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced bankers in all markets 
reconciliation of non gaap financial information management utilizes certain non gaap financial measures to monitor the company s performance 
while we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides additional insight into our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
the company presents a computation of tangible equity along with tangible book value and return on average tangible equity 
the company defines tangible equity as total shareholders equity before goodwill and core deposit intangible assets 
tangible book value is calculated as tangible equity divided by total shares outstanding 
return on average tangible equity is calculated as net income divided by average tangible equity 
we believe that tangible equity and certain tangible equity ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy which may be used when making period to period and company to company comparisons 
tangible equity and tangible equity ratios are considered to be non gaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders equity  book value and return on average equity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity 

table of contents total shareholders equity subtract goodwill core deposit intangibles tangible shareholders equity non gaap book value tangible book value non gaap return on average equity return on average tangible equity non gaap non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied  and are not audited 
although we believe these non gaap financial measure are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
summary of critical accounting policies we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  commonly referred to as the fasb 
the fasb sets generally accepted accounting principles gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
references to gaap issued by the fasb in this report are to the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes referred to as the codification or asc 
the fasb finalized the codification effective for periods ending on or after september  prior fasb statements  interpretations  positions  eitf consensuses  and aicpa statements of position are no longer being issued by the fasb 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
however  when referring to guidance issued by the fasb  the company refers to topics in the asc rather than the specific fasb statement 
we have updated references to gaap in this report to reflect the guidance in the codification 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in this form k 
management believes that the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered critical under the sec definition 
table of contents nonaccrual loans accrual of interest is discontinued on contractually delinquent loans when management believes that  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
at a minimum  loans that are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by days or more are placed on nonaccrual status  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received satisfying all delinquent principal and interest amounts  and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain 
in accordance with gaap  payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to the principal balance and no interest income is recognized 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balances of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
troubled debt restructurings in the normal course of business  the company may modify the terms of certain loans  attempting to protect as much of its investment as possible 
management evaluates the circumstances surrounding each modification to determine whether it is a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
tdrs exist when the restructuring constitutes a concession  and the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
additional information regarding the company s troubled debt restructurings can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had a recorded balance of  in goodwill from the november  acquisition of nwb financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary northwest business bank nwbf 
in accordance with financial accounting standards  assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis of its goodwill at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of december   and in addition  as a result of the transaction the bank recorded a core deposit intangible which was amortized using a straight line method and was fully amortized in november share based compensation consistent with the provisions of fasb asc  stock compensation  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation  we recognize expense for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology  and ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
fair value measurements generally accepted accounting principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb asc  fair value measurements  establishes a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the 
table of contents classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market derived or market based information obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data 
in general  fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets that the company has the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in this form k 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
th quarter compared to th quarter two tables follow which analyze the changes in net interest income for the fourth quarter and fourth quarter table i  average balance analysis of net interest income  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets 
net interest income and the net interest margin for all periods reported have been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using a percent tax rate 
table ii  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
on a linked quarter basis  net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets for fourth quarter was percent  down and basis points from the and percent margins reported for third quarter and fourth quarter  respectively 
for both the linked quarter and quarter over quarter margin results  a decline in earning asset yields was partially offset by a decrease in the company s cost of funds 
margins are expected to remain under pressure and subject to compression due to the prolonged low interest rate environment as yields on new loan production are lower than portfolio averages and core deposits are priced at virtual floors 
to the extent loan growth experienced during the last half of  continues in  and higher yielding loans replace run off of the lower yielding securities portfolio  the margin compression may be mitigated to some extent 
in addition  the acquisition of century bank is expected to provide some lift to the margin due to the accretion of loan discount into interest income 
in late  the federal reserve indicated that it expected a very low target range for the federal funds rate as long as the unemployment rate remained above and projected near term and longer term inflation remained modest 
it further indicated that this guidance was consistent with its earlier expectation of exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate through at least mid in early  federal reserve officials also indicated that their perception of conditions in the us financial system arising from this very low rate environment  over time  could affect this accommodative monetary policy 
given current levels of unemployment and inflation  interest rates are expected to remain at low levels for an extended 
table of contents period 
however  the longer portion of the yield curve is still expected to be volatile as the market responds to economic reports  federal reserve actions and global economic events 
table i shows that earning asset yields declined by basis points to percent in fourth quarter from percent in fourth quarter this decline in earning asset yields was primarily attributable to a lower yield on both the loan and securities portfolio  and a change in the earning asset mix in fourth quarter when compared to the same quarter in the prior year as the lower yielding securities portfolio grew in proportion to total earning assets 
the decline in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to accelerated prepayment speeds on agency mortgage backed securities increasing the amortization of premiums 
the decline in the yield on loans was primarily due to the following factors the historical low interest rate environment as new loans were booked at yields lower than the average portfolio  the highly competitive pricing on new loan production  and reductions in rates on existing loans and loan rate floors as they came up for renewal due to competitive pressure 
the decline in earning asset yields was partially offset by a decrease in the cost of funds 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points from percent in fourth quarter to percent in fourth quarter the decline in rates is evident in each core deposit category as the cost of interest bearing core deposits fell by basis points from percent in fourth quarter to percent in fourth quarter the cost of wholesale funding also moved down from percent in fourth quarter to percent in fourth quarter all categories of wholesale funding showed a decline in rates during the period 
table ii shows the changes in net interest income due to rate and volume for the quarter ended december   as compared to the quarter ended december  fourth quarter interest income including loan fees declined by  from the prior year with higher volumes of earning assets increasing interest income by  which was more than offset by a  decline in interest income due to lower rates 
the decline in interest income due to lower rates was attributable to both the securities portfolio and the loan portfolio as yields on both of these earning assets continued to decline during the period in the historically low interest rate environment 
the decline in interest income in fourth quarter when compared to the same quarter one year ago was partially offset by a drop in interest expense 
the entire decline in interest expense was related to lower rates  with the majority of this decline related to lower rates on core deposit products 
the rate volume analysis shows that interest expense on core deposits fell by from the prior year period due to both lower volumes and lower rates

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely

management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate and this level of unallocated reserves was prudent in light of the economic conditions and uncertainty that exists in the northwest markets that the company serves 
noninterest income noninterest income is derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  and business credit card interchange fees 
compared to for the year  noninterest income was  down or percent from the same period last year

excluding this gain on sale of securities in  noninterest income in was up or percent over the same period last year 
the increase in noninterest income when compared to last year was primarily attributable to the in revenue from the boli investment and a increase in the other income category  which was primarily generated from rental income on other real estate owned properties 
compared to noninterest income for the year was  up  or percent over gains on the sales of securities  net of otti charges accounted for  of the increase in noninterest income in excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and otti  noninterest income for the year was up or percent over the same period in all categories of noninterest income with the exception of mortgage banking income showed improvement for the year when compared to other fees  primarily merchant bankcard  were up or percent in over as both transaction volumes and margins continued to improve 
account service charges also showed an increase of or percent resulting from recent changes in the service charge structure on business accounts 
loan servicing fees and the other income category also show small increases with loan servicing fees up and other income up noninterest expense noninterest expense represents all expenses other than the provision for loan losses and interest costs associated with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
it incorporates personnel  premises and equipment  data processing and other operating expenses 
compared to for the year  noninterest expense was  down  or percent from the year noninterest expense included of merger expense related to the acquisition of century bank 
the decline in noninterest expense was primarily due to a decrease in fdic assessments  other real estate expense  and the other expense category  that was partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits 
fdic assessments in were  down or percent from the same period last year 
the decline in fdic assessments was primarily due to a change in assessment methodology based on net tangible assets versus deposits that became effective in second quarter other real estate expense was  in  down  or percent from last year  reflecting a lower level of valuation write downs in the current year when compared to last year 
the other expense category in was  down or percent from the same period last year 
the drop in the other expense category was primarily due to a decrease in legal fees related to problem assets 
offsetting a portion of these declines in noninterest expense was a or percent increase in personnel expense 
within the personnel expense category  base salaries  equity based compensation  bonus expense and group 
table of contents insurance increased    and  respectively 
the increase in base salary expense was a percent increase over the prior year same period 
the increase in these areas was partially offset by increased loan origination costs of  which were booked as a reduction of salary expense 
compared to noninterest expense for the year was  up  or percent over the same period in all categories of expense showed an increase with the exception of premises and equipment expense and fdic assessments 
the largest increases in noninterest expense categories were in four categories personnel expense  business development  other real estate  and the other expense category 
the increase in personnel expense was primarily related to increased base salaries and incentive compensation  lower loan origination costs  and increased group insurance expense 
base salaries and incentive compensation were up or percent and or percent  respectively  for the year  while loan origination cost a reduction to personnel expense declined by or percent when compared to the increase in base salaries reflected staff additions made during and performance increases for existing staff 
the accrual for incentive compensation was up as a result of better corporate performance in when compared to the prior year 
loan origination costs were down in primarily due to changes in costs implemented during the latter part of a portion of the increases in these categories was offset by a drop of in equity based compensation  which was lower due to reversals of prior period accruals for cash settled stock appreciation rights sars 
the  increase in other real estate expense resulted primarily from valuation write downs recorded during  which totaled  the other noninterest expense category increase was or up percent and primarily due to increases in expenses related to problem assets  specifically legal fees and repossession and collection expense  which were up and  respectively 
other expense categories contributing to the increase in the other expense line item include insurance expense up  accounting fees up  telephone expense up  travel expense up  and training related expenses up balance sheet securities available for sale at december   the company had  in securities classified as available for sale 
at december    of these securities were pledged as collateral for public deposits in oregon and washington 
at december   securities available for sale of  were up  over december  at december   the portfolio had an unrealized taxable gain of  compared to an unrealized taxable gain of  at december  during  the company purchased  in new securities  while receiving  in cash flow from maturities and pay downs on mortgage backed securities 
purchases during the year were high quality agency mortgage backed securities  many of which were zero percent risk weighted  bullet agencies  and longer term taxable and tax exempt municipals 
these purchases were part of a three pronged strategy to add liquidity to the asset side of the balance sheet  provide earnings in light of slow loan growth  and hedge the balance sheet against an increasing rate scenario due to the company s liability sensitive position 
however  due to the prospect of a low interest rate environment for an extended period of time  the company expanded purchases of longer term municipals to provide additional income and reduce the company s effective tax rate 
at december   the portfolio had an average life of years and duration of years

this portfolio consists of individual securities 
management reviews monthly all available information  including current and projected default rates and current and projected loss severities  related to the collectability of its potentially impaired investment securities and determined no additional otti was required during however  recognition of additional otti on the private label mortgage backed portion of the portfolio is possible in future quarters depending upon economic conditions  default rates on home mortgages  loss severities on foreclosed homes  unemployment levels  and home values 

table of contents in management s opinion  the remaining securities in the portfolio in an unrealized loss position are considered only temporarily impaired 
the company has no intent  nor is it more likely than not  that it will be required to sell its impaired securities before their recovery 
the impairment is due to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of the securities  and not due to concerns regarding the underlying credit of the issuers or the underlying collateral 
the decline in value of these securities has resulted from current economic conditions 
although yields on these securities may be below market rates during the period  no loss of principal is expected

the federal reserve and the fdic have in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us bank holding companies and banks 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in three ways  first by measuring tier capital to leverage assets  followed by capital measurement in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
these guidelines require a minimum of tier capital to leverage assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets 
in order to be classified as well capitalized  the highest capital rating  by the fdic  these three ratios must be in excess of   and  respectively 
the bank s leverage capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio  and total risk based capital ratio were   and  respectively  at december   all ratios being well above the minimum well capitalized designation

due to its strategic focus to market to specific segments  the company has been successful in developing deposit relationships with several large clients  which are generally defined as deposit relationships of  or more  which are closely monitored by management and company officers 
at december   large deposit relationships with the company accounted for  or percent of total outstanding core deposits 
the single largest client represented percent of outstanding core deposits at december  the loss of this deposit relationship or other large deposit relationships could cause an adverse effect on short term liquidity 
the company uses a point risk rating system to evaluate each of its large depositors in order to assist management in its daily monitoring of the volatility of this portion of its core deposit base 
the risk rating system attempts to determine the stability of the deposits of each large depositor  evaluating  among other things  the length of time the depositor has been with the company and the likelihood of loss of individual large depositor relationships 
risk ratings on large depositors are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted if necessary

inflation substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  did not change significantly 
the effects of inflation have not had a material impact on the company 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
although permitted by its funds management policy  the company does not presently use derivatives  such as forward and futures contracts  options or interest rate swaps  to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
in addition to the interest rate shock analysis  the company also prepares a three year forecast of the balance sheet and income statement using a flat rate scenario  ie  rates unchanged and a most likely rate scenario where rates are projected to change based on management s analysis of expected economic conditions and interest rate environment 
this analysis takes into account growth in loans and deposits and management strategies that could be employed to maximize the net interest margin and net interest income 
the company utilizes in house asset liability modeling software  profitstar  to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in a parallel shift of the yield curve in basis point increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
the company shocks the balance sheet at one  two and three years into the future to provide management with both short term and long term interest rate risk information 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities  such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts  are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
at december   the company was liability sensitive  meaning that in a rising rate environment  the net interest margin and net interest income would decline 
the company s interest rate risk position was primarily due to three factors active floors on  of variable rate loans  an increase in the average life of the securities portfolio as a result of purchases of longer term taxable and tax exempt municipals and extension of the life of agency mortgage back securities due to rising long term rates  and the composition of the company s core deposit base  which consists primarily of non maturing deposits subject to immediate repricing 

table of contents the following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income at one year of interest rate changes plus basis points and minus basis points in basis point increments 
the base figure of  used in the analysis represents the actual net interest income for the year due to the various assumptions used for this modeling and potential balance sheet strategies management may implement to mitigate interest rate risk  no assurance can be given that projections will reflect actual results
