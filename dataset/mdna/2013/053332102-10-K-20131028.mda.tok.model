item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the nation s leading retailer  and a leading distributor  of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states 
we began operations in and at august   operated  stores in the united states  including puerto rico  in mexico  and three in brazil 
each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars  sport utility vehicles  vans and light trucks  including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and non automotive products 
at august   in  of our domestic stores  we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local  regional and national repair garages  dealers  service stations and public sector accounts 
we also have commercial programs in select stores in mexico  as well as in our stores in brazil 
we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www 
alldata 
com 
additionally  we sell automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories  and non automotive products through www 
autozone 
com  and accessories and performance parts through www 
autoanything 
com  and our commercial customers can make purchases through www 
autozonepro 
com 
we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 
executive summary we achieved strong performance in fiscal  delivering record net income of billion  a increase over the prior year  and sales growth of million  a increase over the prior year 
we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business 
we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business  where we continue to build our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment 
over the past several years  various factors have occurred within the economy that affect both our customers and our industry  including the impact of the recession  continued high unemployment  and other challenging economic conditions 
although we have seen a recent increase in new vehicle sales  we believe our consumers cash flows continue to decrease due to the previously listed factors 
given the nature of these macroeconomic factors  we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue  nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 
we believe other macroeconomic factors have adversely affected both our customers and our industry 
during fiscal  the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states remained at a high level  per gallon  compared to per gallon during fiscal we continue to believe gas prices will remain at overall high levels  thereby reducing discretionary spending for all consumers  and  in particular  our customers 
with approximately billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the us  each decrease at the pump contributes approximately billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month 
given the unpredictability of gas prices  we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease  nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 
an additional macroeconomic factor facing our customer is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic levels 
the reduction in our customers take home pay as a result of the recent increase in payroll taxes was effective at the beginning of the calendar year and  at this point  we cannot predict the impact this change has had or will have on our sales in future periods 
during fiscal  failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix  at approximately of total sales  with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers 
while 
table of contents we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years  we did experience a slight decline in sales of the maintenance category as a percentage of sales 
we believe the slowdown in maintenance related products during fiscal was largely due to weather related impacts in various regions 
because of the unusually mild winter during fiscal across parts of the us  we saw a reduced benefit from sales of maintenance related products in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  sales in the maintenance category did improve in the last quarter of fiscal due to a more normalized winter in fiscal as compared to fiscal our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message  store staffing  and product assortment 
specifically  during fiscal  we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment 
as a result  we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our hub stores and increasing product availability in our stores 
we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 
the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 
miles driven we believe that as the number of miles driven increases  consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance  resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items 
while over the long term  we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven  we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven 
during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven  we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors  including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 
since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june latest publicly available information  miles driven decreased slightly compared to the same period last year 
seven year old or older vehicles since  new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels  which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 
we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately  miles each year 
in seven years  the average miles driven equates to approximately  miles 
our experience is that at this point in a vehicle s life  most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating 
according to the latest data provided by the automotive aftermarket industry association  as of january   the average age of vehicles on the road is years as compared to years as of january  although the average age of vehicles continues to increase  it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years 
however  in the near term  we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase  as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy 
as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases  we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal for the fiscal year ended august   we reported net sales of billion compared with billion for the year ended august   a increase from fiscal this growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of million  the rd week sales of million  and sales from autoanything for a portion of the fiscal year 
at august   we operated  domestic stores  stores in mexico and three stores in brazil  compared with  domestic stores  stores in mexico and none in brazil at august  we reported a total auto parts domestic  mexico and brazil sales increase of for fiscal gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales for fiscal the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs  partially offset by the inclusion of autoanything basis points 

table of contents operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  improved due to lower incentive compensation basis points  partially offset by lower sales growth rates 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period  partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates 
average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal and weighted average borrowing rates were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal our effective income tax rate was of pre tax income for fiscal compared to for fiscal net income for fiscal increased by to billion  and diluted earnings per share increased to from in fiscal the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of approximately effective december  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of autoanything  an online retailer of specialized automotive products for up to million  including an initial cash payment of million  up to a million holdback payment for working capital true ups  and contingent payments not to exceed million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we paid the holdback payment for working capital true ups of million 
with this acquisition  we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets 
the results of operations from autoanything have been included in our other business activities since the date of acquisition 
the purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of million and intangible assets totaling million 
goodwill generated from the acquisition is tax deductible and is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce 
the contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of and the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was million 
we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset related to the acquisition of autoanything 
based on an analysis of autoanything s revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections  we determined it was more likely than not the goodwill attributed to autoanything was impaired 
accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of autoanything s trade name as compared to its carrying value  it was determined that autoanything s trade name was also impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the trade name 
based on the revised plan financial results  we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration 
therefore  we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at august  to million  resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal the net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of million 
the net impact is included in operating  selling  general and administrative expenses in our other business activities 
fiscal compared with fiscal for the fiscal year ended august   we reported net sales of billion compared with billion for the year ended august   a increase from fiscal this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of and sales from new stores of million 
the improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value  partially offset by decreased transaction counts 
at august   we operated  domestic stores and stores in mexico  compared with  domestic stores and stores in mexico at august  we reported a total auto parts domestic and mexico operations sales increase of for fiscal 
table of contents gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales for fiscal the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher merchandise margins basis points and lower shrink expense basis points 
lower acquisition costs drove the higher merchandise margins for the year 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal the slight increase in operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  was the result of higher self insurance costs basis points  partially offset by lower incentive compensation basis points 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period  partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates 
average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal and weighted average borrowing rates were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal our effective income tax rate was of pre tax income for fiscal compared to for fiscal net income for fiscal increased by to million  and diluted earnings per share increased to from in fiscal the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of approximately seasonality and quarterly periods our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september  in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about to higher than in the slower months of december and january 
during short periods of time  a store s sales can be affected by weather conditions 
extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail  thereby increasing sales of seasonal products 
mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales  as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather  with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather 
over the longer term  the effects of weather balance out  as we have stores throughout the united states  puerto rico  mexico and brazil 
each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of weeks  and the fourth quarter consisted of weeks in and weeks in and because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of or weeks  compared with weeks for each of the first three quarters  our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year represented of annual sales and of net income  the fourth quarter of fiscal represented of annual sales and of net income  and the fourth quarter of fiscal represented of annual sales and of net income 
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in fiscal  billion in fiscal  and billion in fiscal cash flows from operations are favorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables and the growth in net income 
we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of at august   at august   and at august  our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores and an increased number of stores 
during fiscal  we initiated a variety of strategic inventory tests focused on increasing inventory availability  which increased our inventory per store 
many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms 
these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio 
our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued new store development program 
from the beginning of fiscal to august   we have opened new stores 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in 
table of contents fiscal we invested million in capital assets in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores 
new store openings were for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were million during fiscal there were no acquisitions in fiscal or fiscal we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities 
we purchased million of marketable securities in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal capital asset disposals provided proceeds of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled billion for fiscal  billion for fiscal  and billion for fiscal the treasury stock purchases in fiscal  and were primarily funded by cash flows from operations  and by increases in debt levels 
proceeds from issuance of debt were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes  including for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  store openings and stock repurchases 
proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal were also used for the acquisition of autoanything 
in fiscal  we repaid our million senior notes due in june and our million senior notes due in october using commercial paper borrowings 
there were no repayments of debt in fiscal in fiscal  we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our million senior notes due in november  to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
in  we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowings in the amount of million 
in  net payments of commercial paper and short term borrowings were million 
in  we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowing in the amount of million 
during fiscal  we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure 
the amount of our investments in our new store program is impacted by different factors  including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment  located in the united states  mexico or brazil  or located in urban or rural areas 
during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  our capital expenditures have increased by approximately  and  respectively  as compared to the prior year 
our mix of store openings has moved away from build to suit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment  resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years  and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august  in addition to the building and land costs  our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers  reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio 
we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases  however  our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us 
certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us  allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate 
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions  we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures  working capital requirements and stock repurchases 
the balance may be funded through new borrowings 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 
our cash balances are held in various locations around the world 
of the million and million of cash and cash equivalents at august   and august   respectively  million and million  respectively  were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations 
we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended august   our after tax return on invested capital roic was as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
roic is calculated as after tax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases 
the decrease in roic is primarily due to the acquisition of autoanything 
we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance 
debt facilities in september  we amended and restated our million revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in july the capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to billion 
this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings  letters of credit and other short term  unsecured bank loans 
the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval  may include up to million in letters of credit  and may include up to million in capital leases each fiscal year 
under the revolving credit facility  we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans 
interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate  defined as the london interbank offered rate libor plus the applicable percentage  as defined in the revolving credit facility  depending upon our senior  unsecured  non credit enhanced long term debt rating 
interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility 
we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility 
the revolving credit facility expires in september the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest  taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents 
our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august  was as of august   million of commercial paper borrowings and million of the senior notes due january are classified as long term in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility 
as of august   we had million of availability under our billion revolving credit facility  expiring in september that would allow us to replace these short term obligations with long term financing 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of million 
as of august   we have million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility  which expires in june in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above  we had million in letters of credit outstanding as of august  these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis 
on april   we issued million in senior notes due july under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april  the shelf registration 
the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
proceeds from the debt issuance on april   were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the million in senior notes due june on november   we issued million in senior notes due january under the shelf registration 
proceeds from the debt issuance on november   were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings  which were used to repay the million in senior notes due in october  and for general corporate purposes 

table of contents on april   we issued million in senior notes due april under the shelf registration 
proceeds from the debt issuance on april   were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
on november   we issued million in senior notes due under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  we used the proceeds from the november  issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the senior notes that matured on november   to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
the senior notes issued in july and the and senior notes issued during august  collectively  the notes  are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded 
the notes  along with the senior notes issued in april  the senior notes issued in november  the senior notes issued in april and the senior notes issued in during november  also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements 
our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants  primarily restrictions on liens 
under our revolving credit facility  covenants include limitations on total indebtedness  restrictions on liens  a maximum debt to earnings ratio  and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances 
these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above 
all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 
as of august   we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 
for the fiscal year ended august   our adjusted debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and share based compensation expense ebitdar ratio was as compared to as of the comparable prior year end 
we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt  capital lease obligations and rent times six  and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and share based compensation expense to net income 
we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings 
we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 
stock repurchases during  we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the board 
on june   the board voted to increase the authorization by million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from billion to billion 
from january to august   we have repurchased a total of million shares at an aggregate cost of billion 
we repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of billion during fiscal  million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of billion during fiscal  and million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of billion during fiscal considering cumulative repurchases as of august   we have million remaining under the board of director s authorization to repurchase our common stock 
subsequent to august   we have repurchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million

operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
capital lease obligations include related interest 
self insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations 
although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities  the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns 
accordingly  we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account 
during fiscal  we made contributions of million to the pension plan 
we expect to make contributions of approximately million during fiscal  however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 
as of august   our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is million and our pension assets are valued at million  resulting in a net pension obligation of million 
amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are million at august  the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future  unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 
additionally  our tax liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  was million at august  approximately million is classified as current liabilities and million is classified as long term liabilities 
we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august  in thousands total other commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers 
there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year  but have automatic renewal clauses 

table of contents reconciliation of non gaap financial measures selected financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these non gaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value 
non gaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures  or considered in isolation  for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance  financial position or cash flows 
however  we have presented the non gaap financial measures  as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year to year operating results 
furthermore  our management and compensation committee of the board use the above mentioned non gaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance based compensation 
we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

recent accounting pronouncements see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions 
our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board 
the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management inventory reserves and cost of sales lifo we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method for domestic merchandise and the first in  first out fifo method for mexico inventories 
due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases  our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method 
we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments  and due to price deflation  lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by million at august   calculated using the dollar value method 

table of contents inventory obsolescence and shrinkage our inventory  primarily hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and non automotive products  is used on vehicles that have rather long lives  and therefore  the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs  we record a charge less than million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference 
these charges are based on management s judgment  including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 
historically  we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory  nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates 
however  we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 
additionally  we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage  which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories 
shrinkage may occur due to theft  loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods  among other things 
throughout the year  we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates 
we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results 
over the last three years  there has been less than a basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 
each quarter  we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results 
to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates  we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 
a difference in our inventory reserves as of august   would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal vendor allowances we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including allowances for warranties  advertising and general promotion of vendor products 
vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory  unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor s products 
approximately of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 
based on our vendor agreements  a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases 
therefore  we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory 
during the year  we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations 
we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them 
historically  we have had write offs less than thousand in each of the last three years 
goodwill and intangibles we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceeds the current fair value 
we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors  such as macroeconomic  industry  market  or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit s fair value 
if these factors indicate impairment  we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance  estimates of discount rates  and other factors 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the fair value  we recognize an impairment loss 
indefinite lived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset 
table of contents exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss 
these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management  and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates 
the carrying value of goodwill at august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal fourth quarter of  we recorded an million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a million impairment charge to autoanything s trade name 
the million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of million at august  no indefinite lived intangible amounts were recorded at august  we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration 
therefore  these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august  no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in previous fiscal years 
no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal or in previous fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles 
self insurance reserves we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation  employee health  general and products liability  property and vehicle liability  and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks 
our self insurance reserve estimates totaled million at august   and million at august  this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations  including inflation  increases in health care costs  the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked  as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate 
the assumptions made by management in estimating our self insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience  judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels 
we utilize various methods  including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods  to estimate the cost to settle reported claims  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating these liabilities  we consider factors  such as the severity  duration and frequency of claims  legal costs associated with claims  healthcare trends  and projected inflation of related factors 
in recent history  our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent  and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates 
as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred  we will adjust our reserves accordingly 
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks 
arriving at these estimates  however  requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management  and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates 
for example  changes in our assumptions about health care costs  the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness  the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates  causing our reserves to be overstated or understated 
for instance  a change in our self insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately million for fiscal our liabilities for workers compensation  certain general and product liability  property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities  however  the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities 
accordingly  we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long term using the risk free interest rate as of the balance sheet date 
if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by basis points  net income would have been affected by approximately million for fiscal our liability for health benefits is classified as current  as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 
income taxes our income tax returns are audited by state  federal and foreign tax authorities  and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time 
tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the 
table of contents contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits  changes in tax laws  litigation  appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions 
we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded 
as of august   we had approximately million reserved for uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years  however  actual results could differ from our estimates  and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
specifically  management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions 
additionally  to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or must pay in excess of recognized reserves  our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
pension obligation prior to january   substantially all full time employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan 
the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee s highest consecutive five year average compensation 
on january   the plan was frozen 
accordingly  pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
on january   our supplemental  unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen 
accordingly  plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
as the plan benefits are frozen  the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels  but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august   we have assumed a long term rate of return on our plan assets 
this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio  our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions 
we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis  and revise it accordingly 
additionally  we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets 
at august   our plan assets totaled million in our qualified plan 
our assets are generally valued using the net asset values  which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded 
we have no assets in our nonqualified plan 
a basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately million for the qualified plan 
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term  high quality  corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities 
this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year 
for fiscal  we assumed a discount rate of 
a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense 
a basis point change in the discount rate at august  would impact annual pension expense income by approximately million for the qualified plan and thousand for the nonqualified plan 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from  among other things  changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
from time to time  we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks 
to date  based upon our current level of foreign operations  no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk 
all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board 
further  we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates 
at times  we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts  treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps 
we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances 
we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other 
our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 
unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into two treasury rate locks  each with a notional amount of million 
these agreements were cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the million senior note debt issuance in november the fixed rates of the hedges were and and were benchmarked based on the year us treasury notes 
these locks expired on november  and resulted in a loss of million  which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
the hedges remained highly effective until they expired  and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into two treasury rate locks 
these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the million senior note debt issuance in april the treasury rate locks had notional amounts of million and million with associated fixed rates of and respectively 
the locks were benchmarked based on the year us treasury notes 
these locks expired on april  and resulted in a loss of million  which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
the hedges remained highly effective until they expired  and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings 
the fair value of our debt was estimated at billion as of august   and billion as of august   based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities 
such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by million and million at august  and august   respectively 
we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at august   and million of variable rate debt outstanding at august  in fiscal  at this borrowing level for variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of approximately million 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor 
we had outstanding fixed rate debt of billion at august   and billion at august  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million at august  fuel price risk from time to time  we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results 
historically  the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel 
table of contents exposure 
however  we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments  and therefore  the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities functional currencies 
to minimize our risk  we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies 
foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 
we are exposed to euros  canadian dollars  and brazilian reals  but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican peso denominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars 
we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as long term 
as a result  we generally do not hedge these net investments 
the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the year end exchange rates was million at august  and million at august  the year end exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately with respect to the us dollar during fiscal and decreased by approximately during fiscal the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august  and august   amounted to approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations
