item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information and analysis of our results of operations from through  and our liquidity and capital resources 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
executive overview we design  contract for the manufacture of and market a broad range of women collection sportswear  suits and dresses  casual sportswear and jeanswear for women and children and women and men footwear and accessories 
we sell our products through a broad array of distribution channels  including better specialty stores  department stores  mass merchandisers and international concession arrangements  primarily in the united states  canada and europe 
we also operate our own network of retail and factory outlet stores and several e commerce web sites 
in addition  we license the use of several of our brand names to select manufacturers and distributors of women and men apparel and accessories worldwide 
significant highlights from the discussion and analysis of our results of operations for are as follows total revenues were billion  an increase of million from a year ago  gross profit  as a percent of sales  increased to from a year ago  operating income was million  a decrease of million from a year ago  we recorded goodwill and trademark impairments of million  compared with million a year ago  and diluted loss per share was  compared with earnings per share of from a year ago 
during  the following significant events took place on february   we announced the creation of the jones group fashion office to support the growth of core and emerging brands  on july   we acquired an interest in brian atwood related intellectual property from ba holding group  inc  bka international  inc and brian atwood  we acquired of the equity interests in atwood italia srl  and we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of brian atwood  ltd 
collectively  brian atwood  and on september   we issued an additional million of senior notes due the notes 
trends the uncertain economic and political environments have resulted in fluctuating consumer confidence 
fluctuating energy  gasoline and other prices are impacting consumers discretionary income 
this may lead to reduced consumer spending  which could affect our net sales and our future profitability 
we also believe that several significant trends are occurring in the apparel  footwear and accessories industry 
we believe that commodity  labor and transportation costs may increase in the future 
we may be limited in our ability to increase our selling prices to offset these increases 
should the consumer not accept higher retail prices for our products  our margins could be adversely affected 
we believe a trend exists among our major customers to expand the differentiation of their offerings and to achieve strategic advantages over competitors by devoting more resources to the development of exclusive products whether products that the retailer designs under brands that it owns private labels or products produced exclusively for the retailer by national brand manufacturers 
retailers are placing more emphasis on developing their brand images and building strong images for their private label merchandise 
exclusive brands  as the term implies  are only available from a specific retailer  and thus customers loyal to these brands can only find them in the stores of that retailer 
we have responded to this trend by leveraging our design  production and marketing capabilities to develop and provide private label products for certain customers and to provide products under certain of our brands exclusively to select customers  such as providing lei products exclusively to walmart  rachel rachel roy products exclusively to macy in the us and glo products exclusively to kmart 
while the private label lines compete directly with our product lines and may receive more prominent positioning on the retail floor by department stores  creating more competition  we believe that national brands are often preferred by the consumer 
furthermore  we believe a trend exists among our major customers to concentrate purchasing among a narrowing group of vendors 
in the future  retailers may have financial problems or continue to consolidate  undergo restructurings or reorganizations  or realign their affiliations  any of which could increase the concentration of our customers 
we attempt to minimize our credit risk from our concentration of customers by closely monitoring accounts receivable balances and credit lines and the ongoing financial performance and credit status of our customers 
consumers are increasing their purchasing of apparel  footwear and accessories through e commerce web sites 
through our web sites  we market either footwear and accessories  apparel or a combination of these products  primarily under their respective brand names 
the selection of products is substantially consistent with the product offerings in our corresponding retail store concepts 
our e commerce systems allow us to fulfill customer orders from inventory at our retail store locations if the items are not available at our distribution center 
the european sovereign debt crisis has negatively affected the financial markets in europe 
these conditions have resulted in fluctuating consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries in europe including the united kingdom  where we derive a significant portion of our revenue  resulting in decreased profitability in our kurt geiger international retail business 
as a result  we have determined the goodwill associated with that business is impaired  and we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge and a million impairment charge related to acquired wholesale customer relationships in see critical accounting policies 
a continuation or worsening of the european sovereign debt crisis could have a further negative effect on our european retail operations  as well as on the businesses of our european wholesale customers  suppliers  and partners 
retail store closings we continue to review our retail operations for underperforming locations 
as a result of these reviews  we have decided to close domestic retail locations that no longer provide strategic benefits 
during  and  we closed  and locations  respectively  and anticipate closing additional locations in we recorded million  million and million of termination benefits and associated employee costs during  and  respectively 
in connection with our decision to close these stores  we reviewed the associated long term assets for impairments 
as a result of these reviews  we recorded million  million and million of impairment losses in  and  respectively  on leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures located in the stores to be closed 
these costs are reported as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the domestic retail segment 
acquisition of brian atwood on july   we acquired brian atwood 
the purchase price was million 
we pursued the acquisition of brian atwood to increase our international presence and further extend our reach into the designer footwear business 
brian atwood wholesale footwear business is reported in our international wholesale segment 
critical accounting policies several of our accounting policies involve significant or complex judgments and uncertainties and require us to make certain critical accounting estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions that are subjective in nature or are about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made 
the estimates with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the collectibility of accounts receivable  the recovery value of obsolete or overstocked inventory and the fair values of goodwill  intangible assets with indefinite lives and acquisition consideration liabilities 
estimates related to accounts receivable and inventory affect all of our segments 
estimates related to goodwill affect our domestic wholesale sportswear  international wholesale and international retail segments 
estimates related to intangible assets with indefinite lives affect our domestic footwear and accessories  international wholesale  international retail  licensing  other and eliminations segment 
for accounts receivable  we estimate the net collectibility  considering both historical and anticipated trends of trade discounts and co op advertising deductions taken by our customers  allowances we provide to our retail customers to flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of our customers 
for inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through off price channels 
historically  actual results in these areas have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not anticipate that our estimates and assumptions are likely to materially change in the future 
however  if we incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
accounting rules generally require that we test at least annually for possible goodwill impairment 
we test our goodwill and our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying value 
we test goodwill at the segment level where acquired businesses have been fully integrated into our existing structure and at one level below the segment level where acquired businesses have not been fully integrated 
as a result of the impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill balance existing in our international retail segment related to kurt geiger was impaired as a result of decreases in projected revenues  profitability and cash flows for the business 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
there were no impairment charges as a result of the or impairment analyses 
we perform our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year 
as a result of the  and impairment analyses  we recorded trademark impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  as a result of decreases in projected revenues and cash flows for certain brands 
all trademark impairment charges are reported as sg a expenses in the licensing  other and eliminations segment 
we also determined that an acquired customer relationship intangible asset from the acquisition of kg group holdings limited kurt geiger was impaired due to decreases in projected wholesale revenues  and we recorded a million impairment charge 
this impairment charge is reported as an sg a expense in the international wholesale segment 
for more information  see goodwill and other intangible assets in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we test both our goodwill and our trademarks for impairment by utilizing discounted cash flow models to estimate their fair values 
these cash flow models involve several assumptions 
changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are i discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks  ii royalty rates used in our trademark valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trademark models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic and market conditions as well as expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
based on our latest annual testing  the following table shows the assumptions we used to derive our fair value estimates and the hypothetical additional impairment charge for goodwill and trademarks resulting from a one percentage point unfavorable change in the discount rate assumption and a unfavorable change in each of our other fair value assumptions dollar amounts in millions 
assumptions effect of unfavorable change goodwill trademarks goodwill trademarks discount rates royalty rates weighted average revenue growth rates long term growth rates at december   we had million of goodwill  of which million has been assigned to the domestic sportswear segment  million has been assigned to the domestic wholesale footwear and accessories segment  million has been assigned to the international wholesale segment and million has been assigned to the international retail segment 
the fair value of each operating segment other than our international retail segment significantly exceeded the segment carrying value at december  we also have million of indefinite lived trademarks 
should economic conditions and trends such as reduced consumer spending or the failure to achieve projected results deteriorate throughout and beyond  especially in the united kingdom and the us  the carrying values of trademarks and goodwill could become further impaired 
at december   we had a total of million accrued for the remaining contingent consideration payments relating to the acquisitions of moda nicola international  llc moda and stuart weitzman holdings  llc swh 
these liabilities represent the present value  discounted at our weighted average cost of capital  of the projected payments based on i for moda  projected revenues and probability weighted gross margins for the years through  and ii for swh  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the acquisition agreement for these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
other than the assumptions used in the impairment testing of our goodwill and trademarks  we have not made any material changes to any of our critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements

accounts payable decreased in the current period compared to an increase in the prior period primarily due to lower levels of inventory purchases and the timing of inventory and related payments 
we also paid million of accrued kurt geiger interest subsequent to the acquisition and received cash inflows related to federal and state tax refunds of million in cash flows from investing activities used million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in funded the purchases of property and equipment as well as the acquisition of brian atwood 
we also received million from the sale of a trademark 
capital expenditures  which amounted to million in  are expected to be approximately million to million for  primarily for computer systems and retail store and showroom construction and remodeling 
although many of the anticipated expenditures for are discretionary  we believe they are necessary to maintain consistent operating levels 
we expect to fund the expenditures from cash generated by operations 
net cash used in investing activities in funded the acquisition of kurt geiger  as well as the purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities in funded the acquisition of moda and swh  as well as the purchases of information systems  leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
cash flows from financing activities used million in  primarily for payments of acquisition consideration liabilities resulting from the acquisitions of swh and moda and repurchases of our common stock 
these payments were partially offset by the issuance of additional notes 
cash flows from financing activities provided million in  primarily as the result of the initial issuance of the notes 
uses of cash during this period were primarily for the repayment of acquired kurt geiger debt  the repurchase of our common stock  the payment of dividends and payments related to the acquisition consideration payable from the swh acquisition 
in march  we issued the notes 
net proceeds were million  of which million was used to repay amounts then outstanding under our secured revolving credit agreement 
in september  we issued an additional million of the notes 
net proceeds including a premium of million were million  which will be used for general corporate purposes 
these additional notes are being treated as a single series with  and have the same terms as and are fungible with the previously issued notes 
cash flows from financing activities used million in  primarily for a cash distribution of million to the former owners of swh as required by the acquisition agreement  dividends to our common shareholders  repurchases of our common stock and costs related to our secured revolving credit agreement 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million in  million shares of our common stock for million in  and  shares of our common stock for million in as of december   million of board authorized repurchases was still available 
additional share repurchases in the future will depend on  among other things  market conditions and our financial condition  although any such repurchases will be subject to limitations under our current revolving credit agreement 
our board of directors has authorized our common stock repurchases as a tax effective means to enhance shareholder value and distribute cash to shareholders and  to a lesser extent  to offset the impact of dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of restricted stock and the exercise of employee stock options 
we believe that we have sufficient sources of funds to repurchase shares without significantly impacting our short term or long term liquidity 
in authorizing future share repurchase programs  our board of directors gives careful consideration to our projected cash flows  our existing capital resources and repurchase limitations under our current revolving credit agreement 
we have a secured revolving credit agreement expiring on april  the credit facility with several lending institutions to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility provide for  among other things a million us commitment which may be drawn by the us borrowers as revolving loans in us dollars or letters of credit in canadian dollars  us dollars  or an lc alternative currency namely euros  sterling  or any other currency acceptable to the lenders  and a million international commitment which may be drawn by the us borrowers or by any canadian or european borrowers as revolving loans or letters of credit in canadian dollars  us dollars  or an lc alternative currency 
up to the entire amount of the credit facility is available for cash borrowings  with up to million available for all letters of credit  and additional sublimits on letters of credit including but not limited to million for standby letters of credit  million for trade letters of credit  and million for letters of credit under the us commitment denominated in an lc alternative currency 
borrowings under the credit facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness  to make certain investments including acquisitions  and for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business 
such borrowings bear interest either based on the alternate base rate  as defined in the credit facility  or based on eurocurrency rates  each with a margin that depends on the availability remaining under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary events of default 
availability under the credit facility is determined with reference to a borrowing base consisting of a percentage of eligible inventory  accounts receivable  credit card receivables and licensee receivables  minus reserves determined by the joint collateral agents 
at december   we had no cash borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding  and our remaining availability was million 
if availability under the credit facility falls below a stated level  we will be required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  will limit or restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens  merge  consolidate  liquidate or dissolve  make investments including acquisitions  loans or advances  sell assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  enter into swap agreements  make certain restricted payments including dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into restrictive agreements  and amend material documents 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our personal property 
swh has a million unsecured borrowing facility with a lending institution that expires on october  and is renewable on an annual basis  under which no cash borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding at december  cash borrowings under this facility bear interest based on either the prevailing prime rate or the prevailing libor rate plus basis points 
swh also has a million variable rate unsecured borrowing facility with a european lending institution that expires in march and is renewable on an annual basis  under which no amounts were outstanding at december  proceeds from the issuance of common stock to our employees exercising stock options amounted to million in no employees exercised stock options in or as of december   we have no outstanding stock options 
we recorded net pension expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  to other comprehensive income resulting primarily from the lowering of the discount rate used to determine projected pension benefits and investment losses 
our pension and postretirement plans are currently underfunded by a total of million 
as the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are frozen with respect to service credits  the effects on future pension expense are not anticipated to be material to our results of operations or to our liquidity 
we contributed million  million and million to our defined benefit plans in  and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit plans in on february   we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share to all common stockholders of record as of march  for payment on march  economic outlook the uncertain economic and political environments have resulted in fluctuating consumer confidence 
fluctuating energy  gasoline and other prices are impacting consumers discretionary income 
this may lead to reduced consumer spending  which could affect our net sales and our future profitability 
our recent acquisitions have increased our presence within the european union  where the current highly uncertain economic and political conditions may lead to reduced consumer spending in those countries as well 
reduced consumer spending  combined with rising costs related to changes in foreign exchange rates  increasing labor costs primarily in asia  commodity prices and increasing transportation costs  may reduce our gross profit margins from present levels 
we may be limited in our ability to compensate for a loss of revenues or increase our selling prices to offset rising costs 
should the consumer not accept higher retail prices for our products  these rising costs would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are manufactured in many foreign countries  including china  brazil  spain and italy 
due to the current and expected future economic relationship between the united states and china  we may experience increased risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates should china allow the yuan to continue to rise in value against the dollar 
we may also experience increased risk related to changes in foreign currency rates between the euro  british pound and the dollar due to economic conditions in europe 
should unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates occur  increased production costs for our goods manufactured in china  brazil  spain and italy could result 
when adverse economic conditions exist in the united states or abroad  we may experience increased risk related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and we may increase our provision for doubtful accounts in the future should any of our wholesale customers  international distributors or licensees experience significant financial difficulties 
if such conditions lead to defaults that are individually or cumulatively significant  we could experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity 
a significant portion of our international wholesale business involves sales to a small number of distributors and licensees  which increases our accounts receivable risk in these areas 
the economic turmoil in the credit markets over the past several years and the negative effects of the economic environment on our business may negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
however  we believe that available cash and cash equivalents  funds generated by operations and the credit facility will provide the financial resources sufficient to meet our foreseeable working capital  dividend  capital expenditure and stock repurchase requirements and fund our contractual obligations and our acquisition liabilities and commitments 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the participating banks will be willing and able to loan funds to us in accordance with their legal obligations under the credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of sec regulation s k item a 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of december   and  except for purchase obligations  employment contracts and other long term liabilities  is based on information appearing in the notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in millions

under exclusive licenses to manufacture certain items under trademarks not owned by us pursuant to various license agreements  we are obligated to pay the licensors a percentage of our net sales of these licensed products  subject to minimum scheduled royalty and advertising payments 
represents estimated cash payments 
of these amounts  million is payable at a future date when certain conditions have been met and is reported in the more than five years column  as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the payment 
amounts reported as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets primarily represent the present value of these payments 
consists primarily of deferred rent and pension and postretirement liabilities 
pension and postretirement liabilities  which total million  are reported under the more than five years column  as we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing and amounts to be paid 
we plan to contribute million to our defined benefit plans in excludes million of uncertain tax positions  for which we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing and amounts to be paid 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu simplifies the guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill by allowing an organization the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
an organization electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the organization determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in october  the fasb issued asu  technical corrections and improvements 
asu contains amendments to clarify the asc  correct unintended application of guidance  or make minor improvements to the asc that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities 
additionally  the amendments are intended to make the asc easier to understand and the fair value measurement guidance easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing needed clarifications 
the amendments that do not have transition guidance were effective upon issuance 
the amendments that are subject to the transition guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
for public entities  the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market value of our fixed rate long term debt 
we manage this exposure through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policy allows the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures  including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading or other speculative purposes 
the following quantitative disclosures were derived using quoted market prices  yields and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments  taking into consideration the underlying terms  such as the coupon rate  term to maturity and embedded call options 
certain items such as normal course lease contracts  insurance contracts  and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits were not included in the analysis 
for further information see derivatives and financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rates our primary interest rate exposures relate to the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt and interest expense related to our revolving credit facility 
at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt was million 
on that date  the potential decrease in fair value of our fixed rate long term debt instruments resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates was approximately million 
our primary interest rate exposures on variable rate credit facilities are with respect to united states and canadian short term rates 
cash borrowings under these facilities bear interest at rates that vary with changes in prevailing market rates 
at december   we had million in variable rate credit facilities  under which no cash borrowings and million of letters of credit were outstanding 
at december   we had an outstanding interest rate cap that was used in conjunction with interest rate swaps on our million senior notes due the notes to limit our floating rate exposure 
the cap limits our three month libor rate exposure to 
the cap has a termination date of november  at december   the cap had fair value of less than million 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no effect on our results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our products are primarily purchased from foreign manufacturers in pre set united states dollar prices  although we also purchase certain products in euros and pounds 
we also have assets  liabilities and intercompany accounts denominated in certain foreign currencies that generate exchange gains and losses as exchange rates change 
to date  we generally have not been materially adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
at december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to exchange canadian dollars for a total notional value of us million at a weighted average exchange rate of maturing through november and to exchange million for us dollars at an exchange rate of maturing through december the fair value of these contracts at december  was a net unrealized gain of million 
we believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements  because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform its obligation 
however  we do not expect the counterparty  which presently has a high credit rating  to fail to meet its obligations
