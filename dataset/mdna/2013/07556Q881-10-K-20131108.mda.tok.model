item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook executive overview and outlook our primary objective for fiscal was to improve our operational performance to drive our return to profitability 
throughout fiscal  we made progress toward this goal  culminating in recognizing net income of million for the quarter ended september  and positioning us for profitability in fiscal there are four strategies that comprise our multi year path to profitability plan drive sales per community per month  generate higher gross margins  leverage our fixed costs  including both overheads and interest expense and gradually expand our community count 
during fiscal  we showed significant progress on three of these four components and laid the foundation for improvement on the fourth 
improving our gross margins while still achieving greater sales per community per month was our top priority for fiscal we improved our homebuilding gross margins excluding interest  impairments and abandonments by basis points to for the year and increased our absorption rate to sales per community per month versus for fiscal  both on a trailing quarter basis 
during fiscal  we also achieved improved overhead leverage 
our general administrative expenses declined from of total revenue in fiscal to in fiscal finally  in an effort to grow our future community count  we undertook an aggressive land purchase campaign during fiscal  spending million on land and land development for the year  compared with only million in the prior year 
a significant majority of the land that we purchased during fiscal requires development and will become active in either fiscal or fiscal also helping our future community count metrics will be the million of land  located in arizona and california  that we moved from land held for future development to active development during fiscal we expect to continue our focus on our four path to profitability strategies during fiscal  and based on our current expectations of the housing market and general economic conditions  we believe that fiscal will be the company s first full year of profitability since fiscal critical accounting policies some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
inventory valuation held for development our homebuilding inventories that are accounted for as held for development include land and home construction assets grouped together as communities 
homebuilding inventories held for development are stated at cost including direct construction costs  capitalized indirect costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we assess these assets no less than quarterly for recoverability 
generally  upon the commencement of land development activities  it may take three to five years depending on  among other things  the size of the community and its sales pace to fully develop  sell  construct and close all the homes in a typical community 
however  the impact of the recent downturn in our business has significantly lengthened the estimated life of many communities 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated are expected to be less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
when conducting our community level review for the recoverability of our homebuilding inventories held for development  we establish a quarterly watch list of communities with more than homes remaining that carry profit margins in backlog or in our forecast that are below a minimum threshold of profitability 
in our experience  this threshold represents a level of profitability that may be an indicator of conditions which would require an asset impairment but does not guarantee that such impairment will definitively be appropriate 
as such  assets on the quarterly watch list are subject to substantial additional financial and operational analyses and review that consider the competitive environment and other factors contributing to profit margins below our watch list threshold 
for communities where the current competitive and market dynamics indicate that these factors may be other than temporary  which may call into question the recoverability of our investment  a formal impairment analysis is performed 
the formal impairment analysis consists of both qualitative competitive market analyses and a quantitative analysis reflecting market and asset specific information 
our qualitative competitive market analyses include site visits to competitor new home communities and written community level competitive assessments 
a competitive assessment consists of a comparison of our specific community with its competitor communities  considering square footage of homes offered  amenities offered within the homes and the communities  location  transportation availability and school districts  among many factors 
in addition  we review the pace of monthly home sales of our competitor communities in relation to our specific community 
we also review other factors such as the target buyer and the macro economic characteristics that impact the performance of our assets  such as unemployment and the availability of mortgage financing  among other things 
based on this qualitative competitive market analysis  adjustments to our sales prices may be required in order to make our communities competitive 
we incorporate these adjusted prices in our quantitative analysis for the specific community 
the quantitative analysis compares the projected future undiscounted cash flows for each such community with its current carrying value 
this undiscounted cash flow analysis requires important assumptions regarding the location and mix of house plans to be sold  current and future home sale prices and incentives for each plan  current and future construction costs for each plan  and the pace of monthly sales to occur today and into the future 
there is uncertainty associated with preparing the undiscounted cash flow analysis because future market conditions will almost certainly be different  either better or worse  than current conditions 
the single most important input to the cash flow analysis is current and future home sales prices for a specific community 
the risk of over or under stating any of the important cash flow variables  including home prices  is greater with longer lived communities and within markets that have historically experienced greater home price volatility 
in an effort to address these risks  we consider some home price and construction cost appreciation in future years for certain communities that are expected to be selling for more than three years and or if the market has typically exhibited high levels of price volatility 
absent these assumptions on cost and sales price appreciations  we believe the long term cash flow analysis would be unrealistic and would serve to artificially improve future profitability 
finally  we also ensure that the monthly sales absorptions  including historical seasonal differences of our communities and those of our competitors  used in our undiscounted cash flow analyses are realistic  consider our development schedules and relate to those achieved by our competitors for the specific communities 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows from our quantitative analysis are in excess of the carrying value  the asset is considered to be recoverable and is not impaired 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying or book value  we perform a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the community 
the fair value of the community is estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying community assets 
the discount rate used may be different for each community 
the factors considered when determining an appropriate discount rate for a community include  among others community specific factors such as the number of lots in the community  the status of land development in the community  the competitive factors influencing the sales performance of the community and overall market factors such as employment levels  consumer confidence and the existing supply of new and used homes for sale 
if the determined fair value is less than the carrying value of the specific asset  the asset is considered not recoverable and is written down to its fair value plus the asset share of capitalized unallocated interest and other costs 
the carrying value of assets in communities that were previously impaired and continue to be classified as held for development is not increased for future estimates of increases in fair value in future reporting periods 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to projected home sales prices and absorption rates  the timing and amount of the estimated future cash flows and discount rates  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment analyses 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and absorption rates require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
because the projected cash flows used to evaluate the fair value of inventory are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions including decreased sales prices  a change in sales prices or changes in absorption estimates based on current market conditions and management assumptions relative to future results could lead to additional impairments in certain communities during any given period 
market deterioration that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges on previously impaired homebuilding assets in addition to homebuilding assets not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market conditions deteriorate 
asset valuation land held for future development for those communities for which construction and development activities are expected to occur in the future or have been idled land held for future development  all applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred and the inventory is stated at cost unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the future enactment of a development plan or the occurrence of events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the potential development plans of each community in land held for future development if changes in facts and circumstances occur which would give rise to a more detailed analysis for a change in the status of a community to active status or held for development 
asset valuation land held for sale we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
the following criteria are used to determine if land is held for sale management has the authority and commits to a plan to sell the land  the land is available for immediate sale in its present condition  there is an active program to locate a buyer and the plan to sell the property has been initiated  the sale of the land is probable within one year  the property is being actively marketed at a reasonable sale price relative to its current fair value  and it is unlikely that the plan to sell will be withdrawn or that significant changes to the plan will be made 
additionally  in certain circumstances  management will re evaluate the best use of an asset that is currently being accounted for as held for development 
in such instances  management will review  among other things  the current and projected competitive circumstances of the community  including the level of supply of new and used inventory  the level of sales absorptions by us and our competition  the level of sales incentives required and the number of owned lots remaining in the community 
if  based on this review and the foregoing criteria have been met at the end of the applicable reporting period  we believe that the best use of the asset is the sale of all or a portion of the asset in its current condition  then all or portions of the community are accounted for as held for sale 
in determining the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  we consider factors including current sales prices for comparable assets in the area  recent market analysis studies  appraisals  any recent legitimate offers  and listing prices of similar properties 
if the estimated fair value less cost to sell of an asset is less than its current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about land sales prices require significant judgment because the current market is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of land held for sale based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results and may result in additional impairments if market conditions deteriorate 
homebuilding revenues and costs revenue from the sale of a home is generally recognized when the closing has occurred and the risk of ownership is transferred to the buyer 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
sales commissions are recognized as expense when the closing has occurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
warranty reserves we currently provide a limited warranty ranging from one to two years covering workmanship and materials per our defined performance quality standards 
in addition  we provide a limited warranty generally ranging from a minimum of five years up to the period covered by the applicable statute of repose covering only certain defined construction defects 
we also provide a defined structural warranty with single family homes and townhomes in certain states 
since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors whose contracts generally include an indemnity obligation and a requirement that certain minimum insurance requirements be met  including providing us with a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work  claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of our subcontractors 
warranty reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record reserves covering our anticipated warranty expense for each home closed 
management reviews the adequacy of warranty reserves each reporting period  based on historical experience and management estimate of the costs to remediate the claims  and adjusts these provisions accordingly 
our review includes a quarterly analysis of the historical data and trends in warranty expense by operating segment 
an analysis by operating segment allows us to consider market specific factors such as our warranty experience  the number of home closings  the prices of homes  product mix and other data in estimating our warranty reserves 
in addition  our analysis also contemplates the existence of any non recurring or community specific warranty related matters that might not be contemplated in our historical data and trends 
as a result of our analyses  we adjust our estimated warranty liabilities 
based on historical results  we believe that our existing estimation process is accurate and do not anticipate the process to materially change in the future 
our estimation process for such accruals is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that our current warranty reserves are adequate  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs or that future developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
investments in unconsolidated entities excluding our investment in a pre owned rental homes reit  the remainder of our investments in unconsolidated entities are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the unconsolidated entity s members and other third parties 
we account for our interest in our unconsolidated entities under the equity method 
we recognize our share of profits and losses from the sale of lots to other buyers 
our share of profits from lots purchased by beazer homes from the unconsolidated entities are deferred and treated as a reduction of the cost of the land purchased from the joint venture 
such profits are subsequently recognized at the time the home closes and title passes to the homebuyer 
we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period 
a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary 
the amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment carrying value over its estimated fair value 
our assumption of the joint venture estimated fair value is dependent on market conditions 
inventory in the joint venture is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities 
if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity  our proportionate share of it is reflected in our equity in income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities 
the operating results of the unconsolidated joint ventures are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry  which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates  credit availability  unemployment levels and consumer sentiment 
changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities 
because of these changes in economic conditions  actual results could differ materially from management assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future 
income taxes valuation allowance judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if an assessment of their components indicates that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of these assets will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on more likely than not realization threshold criteria 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  the section limitation on our ability to carryforward pre ownership change net operating losses and recognized built in losses or deductions  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for the valuation of deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
during fiscal  we determined that it was not more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized and  therefore  we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
as of september   we continued our evaluation of whether the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was still required 
we considered positive evidence including evidence of recovery in the housing markets where we operate  the prospects of continued profitability and growth  a strong order backlog and sufficient balance sheet liquidity to sustain and grow operations 
although the company s performance and current positioning is bringing it closer to a conclusion that a valuation allowance is no longer needed  further evidence of sustained profitability is needed to reverse our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
therefore  based upon all available positive and negative evidence  we concluded a valuation allowance is still needed for substantially all of our gross deferred tax assets at september  management reassesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets each reporting period 
in future periods  we expect to reduce all or a portion of our valuation allowance  generating a non cash tax benefit  if sufficient positive evidence is present indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
we experienced an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code as of january  section contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforward and certain built in losses or deductions recognized during the five year period after the ownership change 
therefore  our ability to utilize our pre ownership change net operating loss nol carryforwards and certain recognized built in losses or deductions is limited by section there can be no assurance that another ownership change  as defined in the tax law  will not occur 
if another ownership change occurs  a new annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses would be determined as of that date 
seasonal and quarterly variability our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
however  periods of economic downturn in the homebuilding industry will typically alter seasonal patterns

as of september  v v backlog units west east southeast total aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog in millions asp in backlog in thousands backlog above reflects the number of homes for which the company has entered into a sales contract with a customer but has not yet delivered the home 
our backlog may be impacted in the short term due to our reduced number of active communities or by increased cycle times due to labor and or supply shortages 
during the housing downturn  many skilled workers left construction for other industries  and in certain of our markets  the smaller workforce and higher demand for trade labor has created shortages of certain skilled workers  driving up costs and or extending land development and home construction schedules 
our ending backlog as of september  was impacted by our decrease in active communities 
we expect new orders and backlog to increase over time as our active communities increase

we have been able to increase prices in response to market conditions in the majority of our markets in our west segment and select markets or communities in our east and southeast segments 
the increase in asp for the fiscal year ended september  was also partially impacted by a change in mix in closings between products and among communities as compared to the prior years 
homebuilding gross profit the following table sets forth our homebuilding gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment and total homebuilding gross profit and gross margin  and such amounts excluding inventory impairments and abandonments and interest amortized to cost of sales for the fiscal years ended september   and homebuilding gross profit is defined as homebuilding revenues less home cost of sales which includes land and land development costs  home construction costs  capitalized interest  indirect costs of construction  estimated warranty costs  closing costs and inventory impairment and lot option abandonment charges

the increase was due primarily to the million increase in homebuilding revenues including a increase in asp  a million decrease in impairments and abandonments and a million decrease in interest amortized to cost of sales  partially offset by increases in material and labor costs 
this increase for the fiscal year ended september  was offset partially by an million insurance recovery recognized in the prior year related to previously recorded water intrusion related expenditures 
for the fiscal year ended september   our overall homebuilding gross profit increased by million compared to fiscal year the increase was mainly related to a million increase in homebuilding revenues including a slight increase in asp and a million decrease in impairments and abandonments  offset by an increase in interest amortized to cost of sales 
total homebuilding gross profit and gross margin excluding inventory impairments and abandonments and interest amortized to cost of sales are not gaap financial measures 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to homebuilding gross profit determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance 
the magnitude and volatility of non cash inventory impairment and abandonment charges for the company  and for other home builders  have been significant in recent periods and  as such  have made financial analysis of our industry more difficult 
homebuilding metrics excluding these charges  and other similar presentations by analysts and other companies  is frequently used to assist investors in understanding and comparing the operating characteristics of home building activities by eliminating many of the differences in companies respective level of impairments and levels of debt 
management believes these non gaap measures enable holders of our securities to better understand the cash implications of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt obligations as they currently exist and as additional indebtedness is incurred in the future 
these measures are also useful internally  helping management compare operating results and as a measure of the level of cash which may be available for discretionary spending 
in a given quarter  our reported gross margins arise from both communities previously impaired and communities not previously impaired 
in addition as indicated above  certain gross margin amounts arise from recoveries of prior period costs  including warranty items that are not directly tied to communities generating revenue in the period 
home closings from communities previously impaired would  in most instances  generate very low or negative gross margins prior to the impact of the previously recognized impairment 
gross margins at each home closing are higher for a particular community after an impairment because the carrying value of the underlying land was previously reduced to the present value of future cash flows as a result of the impairment  leading to lower cost of sales at the home closing 
this improvement in gross margin resulting from one or more prior impairments is frequently referred to in the aggregate as the impairment turn or flow back of impairments within the reporting period 
the amount of this impairment turn may exceed the gross margin for an individual impaired asset if the gross margin for that asset prior to the impairment would have been negative 
the extent to which this impairment turn is greater than the reported gross margin for the individual asset is related to the specific historical cost basis of that individual asset 
the asset valuations which result from our impairment calculations are based on discounted cash flow analyses and are not derived by simply applying prospective gross margins to individual communities 
as such  impaired communities may have gross margins that are somewhat higher or lower than the gross margin for unimpaired communities 
the mix of home closings in any particular quarter varies to such an extent that comparisons between previously impaired and never impaired communities would not be a reliable way to ascertain profitability trends or to assess the accuracy of previous valuation estimates 
in addition  since any amount of impairment turn is tied to individual lots in specific communities it will vary considerably from period to period 
as a result of these factors  we review the impairment turn impact on gross margins on a trailing month basis rather than a quarterly basis as a way of considering whether our impairment calculations are resulting in gross margins for impaired communities that are comparable to our unimpaired communities 
for fiscal  the homebuilding gross margin from our continuing operations was and excluding interest and inventory impairments  it was 
for the same period  homebuilding gross margins were as follows in those communities that have previously been impaired homebuilding gross margin from previously impaired communities pre impairment turn gross margin impact of interest amortized to cos related to these communities pre impairment turn gross margin  excluding interest amortization impact of impairment turns gross margin post impairment turns  excluding interest these previously impaired communities represented of our closings in fiscal as these communities continue to close out  we expect the impact on our overall homebuilding gross margin to be further reduced

operating income improved by million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  our operating loss was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this improvement is due primarily to a increase in homebuilding revenues  increased gross profit including a million decrease in impairments and abandonments and an warranty recovery in fiscal offset by a million warranty recovery received in income taxes our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by various factors  the most significant of which is the valuation allowance recorded against substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
due to the effect of our valuation allowance adjustments beginning in fiscal  a comparison of our annual effective tax rates must consider the changes in our valuation allowance 
our overall effective tax rates from continuing operations were  and for the fiscal years ended september   and the tax benefit recognized during the fiscal year ended september  and the related effective tax rate related primarily to our release of estimated liabilities for previously uncertain tax positions and utilization of certain carryback opportunities 
the tax benefit recognized during the fiscal year ended september   and the related effective tax rate primarily reflected our release of the estimated liability for previously uncertain tax positions 
beginning on october   the company entered into a day window during which the irs allows taxpayers under continuous examination to elect different tax treatment for issues not under examination 
we filed appropriate forms with the irs in october to adopt a different tax method associated with the timing of various deductions and capitalized costs 
our adoption of a different tax treatment also removed the ability for the irs to make adjustments to these positions in prior years known as audit protection 
therefore  the change in tax treatment of these deductions provided certainty that allowed us to release uncertain tax positions and the associated unrecognized tax benefits in the quarter ended december  the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the impact of our valuation allowance and limited ability to carry back any federal income taxes 
fiscal year ended september  as compared to west segment homebuilding revenues increased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the prior year  primarily due to a increase in closings and a increase in asp 
these improvements were driven by higher demand which facilitated price appreciation in a majority of our submarkets as well as increased absorptions 
as compared to the prior year  our homebuilding gross profit increased million including a million decrease in impairments and abandonments 
homebuilding gross margins without the impairments and abandonments increased from to due to our increased revenues and our ability to absorb increases in direct construction costs per home related to increases in material and labor costs 
the million increase in operating income resulted from the aforementioned increase in homebuilding gross profit offset partially by a million increase in commissions related to the increase in homebuilding revenues 
east segment homebuilding revenues increased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the prior year  driven by an increase in closings and an increase in asp 
these improvements also contributed to a million increase in our homebuilding gross profit including a million decrease in impairments and abandonments 
as a result  homebuilding gross margins increased from to  and excluding impairments and abandonments  increased from to 
the increase in operating income in the east segment was driven primarily by our increased revenues and related gross profit 
these increases were offset partially by increases in commissions  sales and marketing and model refurbishment costs to drive absorptions in some of our underperforming communities 
southeast segment homebuilding revenues increased for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was driven primarily by double digit increases in closings and asp in our florida markets as a result of improved market conditions and the opening of new communities in our orlando market 
the increase in revenues drove a million increase in homebuilding gross profit and an million increase in operating income 
our fiscal and fiscal land sales and other revenue and gross profit in our southeast segment include net fees received for general contractor services we performed on behalf of a third party 
corporate and unallocated corporate and unallocated includes amortization of capitalized interest and numerous shared services functions that benefit all segments  including information technology  national sourcing and purchasing  treasury  corporate finance  legal  branding and other national marketing costs 
the costs of these shared services are not allocated to the operating segments 
for the fiscal year ended september   our corporate and unallocated expense decreased million compared to the prior year which included an million insurance recovery related to previously recorded water intrusion warranty related expenditures 
excluding this prior year recovery  corporate and unallocated expense decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in interest amortized to cost of sales related to lower interest incurred and a change in the mix of homes closed 
fiscal year ended september  as compared to west segment homebuilding revenues increased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the prior year  driven by a increase in closings and a slight increase in asp 
compared to  our homebuilding gross profit increased million including a million decrease in impairments and abandonments 
homebuilding gross margins without impairments and abandonments increased from to primarily due to decreased incentives  price appreciation in certain submarkets and increased absorptions which enabled us to better leverage certain fixed costs 
operating income increased by million due to the increase in homebuilding gross profit and reduced general and administrative expenses offset partially by increased commissions related to our increased revenues and a decrease in gross profit from land sales 
east segment homebuilding revenues increased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the prior year  driven by a increase in closings 
this increase in revenues  offset partially by a million increase in impairments and abandonments  drove a million increase in homebuilding gross profit 
homebuilding gross margins without impairments and abandonments decreased from to driven by changes in product and community mix and  to a lesser extent  to pricing feature changes made in certain of our markets to drive absorptions  respond to competitor actions and address consumer demand 
the million decrease in operating income was attributable to increased commissions and sales and marketing costs which contributed to our increased closings 
southeast segment homebuilding revenues increased for the fiscal year ended september  due primarily to a increase in closings and a increase in asp 
this increase in revenues  along with a million decrease in impairments and abandonments  led to a million increase in homebuilding gross profit and a million increase in operating income 
similar the west  these improvements were due to decreased incentives  price appreciation  and increased absorptions allowing us to better leverage certain fixed costs 
our fiscal and fiscal land sales and other revenue and gross profit in our southeast segment include net fees received for general contractor services we performed on behalf of a third party 
corporate and unallocated for the fiscal year ended september   our corporate and unallocated expense decreased million compared to the fiscal year  mainly due to the million insurance recovery related to previously recorded water intrusion warranty related expenditures recorded in excluding this recovery  our corporate and unallocated gross profit without impairments and abandonments decreased million primarily due to a million increase in interest amortized to cost of sales 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we enter into derivative agreements to manage interest costs and hedge against risks associated with fluctuating interest rates 
as of september   we were not a party to any such derivative agreements 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
liquidity and capital resources 
our sources of liquidity include  but are not limited to  cash from operations  proceeds from senior notes and other bank borrowings  the issuance of equity and equity linked securities and other external sources of funds 
our short term and long term liquidity depend primarily upon our level of net income  working capital management cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other liabilities and available credit facilities 
as of september   our liquidity position consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of capacity under our secured revolving credit facility  plus million of restricted cash  of which million related to our cash secured term loan 
we expect to maintain a significant liquidity position during fiscal  subject to changes in market conditions that would alter our expectations for land and land development expenditures or capital market transactions which could increase or decrease our cash balance on a quarterly basis 
we spent million on land and land development spending during the fiscal year ended september  as we focused on replacing close out communities and positioning the company to increase our active community count 
this spending on land and land development had a significant impact on our net cash used in operating activities  resulting in net cash used in operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended september  during the fiscal years ended september  and  our net cash used in operating activities was million  and million  respectively 
our net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the payment of trade accounts payable  interest obligations and other liabilities 
our net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was impacted by an increase in inventory excluding inventory impairments and abandonment charges and decreases in consolidated inventory not owned of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  which was due primarily to the release of million of restricted cash collateral related to our cash secured term loan offset partially by capital expenditures primarily used for new model homes 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  which was due primarily to release of million of restricted cash collateral related to our cash secured term loan offset partially by capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  which was primarily related which was primarily related to the million funding of collateral restricted cash for the company s cash secured term loan 
in addition to our continued focus on generation and preservation of cash  we are also focused on increasing our stockholders equity and reducing our leverage 
in february we completed a million senior debt offering  net proceeds of which were used to repay our senior notes and repurchase a portion of our senior notes 
further  in september  we completed another million senior debt offering  the proceeds of which will be used to fund additional land acquisitions and development and for general corporate purposes 
during fiscal we also repaid million of our cash secured term loan 
the aforementioned transactions contributed to million of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  in fiscal  we exchanged our mandatory convertible subordinated notes and tangible equity units for common stock at a premium 
we also completed underwritten public offerings of million shares of beazer common stock and million tangible equity units teus for net proceeds of million which  net of debt and other financing payments  resulted in net cash provided by financing activities of million for the fiscal year ended september  in addition  in fiscal  we completed a million senior secured debt offering  net proceeds of which were used to redeem our outstanding senior secured notes and repurchase a portion of our senior notes 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  primarily related to borrowings under our cash secured term loan and our completion of a million senior unsecured debt offering  million net proceeds of which was used to redeem our outstanding senior notes and a portion of our and senior notes 
in september  fitch reaffirmed the company long term debt rating of b 
in january  moody increased the company long term debt rating to caa in december  s p reaffirmed the company long term debt rating of b 
these ratings and our current credit condition affect  among other things  our ability to access new capital 
negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt 
our credit ratings could be lowered or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in particular  a weakening of our financial condition  including any further increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows  could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds  could result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook  or could otherwise increase our cost of borrowing 
we generally fulfill our short term cash requirements with cash generated from our operations and available borrowings 
while we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to participate in a housing recovery  we are mindful of potential short term  or seasonal  requirements for enhanced liquidity that may arise  especially as we increase our land and land development spending to grow our business 
to facilitate this objective  we expanded our secured revolving credit facility from million to million during the year ended september  we have also entered into a number of stand alone  cash secured letter of credit agreements with banks 
these combined facilities will provide for letter of credit needs collateralized by either cash or assets of the company 
we currently have million outstanding letters of credit under these facilities  secured with cash collateral which is maintained in restricted accounts totaling million 
there were no amounts outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility at september  we believe that our million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at september   cash generated from our operations and the availability of new debt and equity financing  if any  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during fiscal in the future  we may from time to time seek to continue to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash repurchases or in exchange for other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
in an effort to accelerate our path to profitability  we may seek to expand our business through acquisition  which may be funded through cash  additional debt or equity 
in addition  any material variance from our projected operating results  could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions in the future on favorable terms or at all 
stock repurchases and dividends paid the company did not repurchase any shares in the open market during the fiscal years ended september    or any future stock repurchases  as allowed by our debt covenants  must be approved by the company s board of directors or its finance committee 
the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
at september   under the most restrictive covenants of each indenture  none of our retained earnings was available for cash dividends 
hence  there were no dividends paid during the fiscal years ended september    or off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual commitments 
at september   we controlled  lots a year supply based on our trailing twelve months of closings 
we owned  or  lots  and  lots   were under option contracts which generally require the payment of cash for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a certain price 
we historically have attempted to control a portion of our land supply through options 
as a result of the flexibility that these options provide us  upon a change in market conditions we may renegotiate the terms of the options prior to exercise or terminate the agreement 
under option contracts  purchase of the properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers and our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the non refundable deposits and other non refundable amounts incurred  which aggregated approximately million at september  the total remaining purchase price  net of cash deposits  committed under all options was million as of september  when market conditions improve  we may expand our use of option agreements to supplement our owned inventory supply 
we expect to exercise  subject to market conditions and seller satisfaction of contract terms  most of our option contracts 
various factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as market conditions  weather conditions and the timing of the completion of development activities  will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether lot options will be exercised 
we have historically funded the exercise of lot options through a combination of operating cash flows 
we expect these sources to continue to be adequate to fund anticipated future option exercises 
therefore  we do not anticipate that the exercise of our lot options will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we participate in land development joint ventures and have investments in other entities in which we have less than a controlling interest 
we enter into investments with unconsolidated entities in order to acquire attractive land positions  to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base 
excluding our investment in a pre owned rental homes reit  the remainder of our investments in our unconsolidated entities are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the unconsolidated entity s members and other third parties 
we account for our interest in our unconsolidated entities under the equity method 
our consolidated balance sheets include investments in unconsolidated entities totaling million and million at september  and september   respectively 
our unconsolidated entities periodically obtain secured acquisition and development financing 
at september   our unconsolidated entities had borrowings outstanding totaling million 
in the past  we and our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt or other obligations of our unconsolidated land development joint ventures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at september  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years senior notes  senior secured notes other notes payable interest commitments under senior notes  senior secured notes other notes payable obligations related to lots under option operating leases uncertain tax positions total interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of september  due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company unrecognized tax benefits as of september  we had outstanding performance bonds of approximately million at september  related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe that our exposure in this area is material to our cash flows or earnings 
as of september   we had variable rate debt outstanding totaling approximately million 
a one percent change in the interest rate would not be material to our financial statements 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at september  was billion  compared to a carrying value of billion 
in addition  the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our estimated discount rates would increase the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments from billion to billion at september
