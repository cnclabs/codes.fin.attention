item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provide information that the company s management believes necessary to achieve an understanding of its financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that such analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive environment for the company s merchandise  including the entry or exit of non traditional retailers of the company s merchandise to or from its markets  releases by the music  video  and video game industries of an increased or decreased number of hit releases  general economic factors in markets where the company s merchandise is sold  and other factors discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
as of february   the company operated stores totaling approximately million square feet in the united states  the district of columbia and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
in fiscal  the company s net sales decreased as compared to fiscal as a result of lower average store count and a decrease in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales decreased during fiscal the us entertainment retailing industry is a mature industry and has experienced declines in recent years 
physical music and video represent our primary product categories in terms of sales and both categories have been impacted by new distribution channels  including digital distribution and internet fulfillment 
as a result  the company has had negative comparable store sales for the past five years 
to mitigate or lessen the impact these changes have had  the company has focused on the following areas in an effort to improve its business improving product mix and creating value for our customers the company tailors the product mix of its stores toward regional tastes in order to optimize the productivity of its stores  seeking to serve key customer segments within each store 
we have also focused on creating a stronger value statement for our customers in our two core categories of video and music to drive additional traffic into the stores and improve customer conversion rates  while offering products in other categories to drive additional sales and broaden our customer base 
in fiscal  the trend and electronics categories represented in aggregate of the company s net sales and had an aggregate comparable store sales increase as the company continues to strengthen assortment in these categories 
store portfolio evaluation during fiscal and fiscal  the company closed and stores  respectively 
the company s real estate strategy is to maintain our core group of profitable locations  while evaluating opportunities for new locations 
the company opened one store in each of fiscal and fiscal the company expects to open additional new stores in the future while continuing to reduce the number of store closings 
the company closes stores when minimum operating thresholds are not achieved or upon lease expiration when either renewal is not available or management determines that renewal is not in the company s best interest 
the company has signed short term lease agreements for desirable locations  which enables us to negotiate rents that are responsive to the then current sales environment 
we will continue to close stores that do not meet our profitability goals  a process which could result in additional future asset impairments and store closure costs 
continued reduction in the number of stores would lower total sales and gross profit of the company 
the company believes that there is near term opportunity in improving the productivity of existing stores 
the environment in which our stores operate is intensely competitive and includes internet based retailers and mass merchants 
we believe a specialty retailer that can differentiate itself by offering a distinctive customer experience  and that can operate efficiently  will be better positioned to maintain or grow market share 
therefore  we remain dedicated to the operational improvement of our stores and offering our customers a rewarding shopping experience 
expanding customer base to strengthen customer loyalty  the company offers its customers the option of signing up for a backstage pass card which provides an additional discount off of everyday selling prices on nearly all products in addition to other value added benefits members receive through the program in exchange for a membership fee 
the company also co sponsors events in many of its stores to provide various segments of its customers an opportunity to experience entertainment and shop for unique and exclusive products based on their particular interests 
key performance indicators management monitors a number of key performance indicators to evaluate its performance  including net sales and comparable store sales the company measures the rate of comparable store net sales change 
a store is included in comparable store net sales calculations at the beginning of its thirteenth full month of operation 
stores relocated  expanded or downsized are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage is greater than 
closed stores that were open for at least thirteen months are included in comparable store sales through the month immediately preceding the month of closing 
the company further analyzes net sales by store format and by product category 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit is calculated based on the cost of product in relation to its retail selling value 
changes in gross profit are impacted primarily by net sales levels  mix of products sold  vendor discounts and allowances and distribution costs 
the company records its distribution  freight and obsolescence expenses in cost of sales 
distribution expenses include those costs associated with receiving  inspecting and warehousing merchandise and costs associated with product returns to vendors 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses included in sg a expenses are payroll and related costs  occupancy charges  general operating and overhead expenses and depreciation charges excluding those related to distribution operations  as discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to merchandise inventory and return costs  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes and accounting for gift card liability 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management believes that of the company s significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity merchandise inventory and return costs merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market under the average cost method 
the average cost method attaches a cost to each item and is a blended average of the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that item 
inventory valuation requires significant judgment and estimates  including obsolescence  shrink and any adjustments to market value  if market value is lower than cost 
inherent in the entertainment products industry is the risk of obsolete inventory 
typically  newer releases generate a higher product demand 
some vendors offer credits to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly  thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
the company records obsolescence and any adjustments to market value if lower than cost based on current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  and market conditions 
the provision for inventory shrink is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last date a physical inventory was performed to the end of the fiscal year 
such estimates are based on historical results and trends and the shrink results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores and the distribution center throughout the year and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
shrink expense  including obsolescence was million  million and million  in fiscal  and respectively 
as a rate to net sales  this equaled  and  respectively 
presently  a change in the rate of shrink provision would equal approximately million in additional charge or benefit to cost of sales  based on fiscal net sales since the last physical inventories 
the company is generally entitled to return merchandise purchased from major vendors for credit against other purchases from these vendors 
certain vendors reduce the credit with a per unit merchandise return charge which varies depending on the type of merchandise being returned 
certain other vendors charge a handling fee based on units returned 
the company records merchandise return charges in cost of sales 
the company incurred merchandise return charges in its fiscal  fiscal and fiscal of million  million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets to determine if any part of the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that the company considers to be important when assessing impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  if the company determines that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  it tests for impairment to determine if an impairment charge is needed 
for the purpose of the asset impairment test  the company has two asset groupings corporate and store level assets 
the company did not record an asset impairment charge during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million  related to the write down of certain long lived assets at underperforming locations 
losses for store closings in the ordinary course of business represent the write down of the net book value of abandoned fixtures and leasehold improvements 
the loss on disposal of fixed assets related to store closings was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  and is included in sg a expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and loss on disposal of fixed assets in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
store closings usually occur at the expiration of the lease  at which time leasehold improvements  which constitute a majority of the assets  are fully depreciated 
there was no impairment of corporate level assets in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
accounting for income taxes requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding interpretation of various taxing jurisdictions  laws and regulations as well as the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets 
these estimates and judgments include the generation of future taxable income  viable tax planning strategies and support of tax filings 
in assessing the value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
management considers the scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the available objective evidence  management concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against its net deferred tax assets as of february  during fiscal and in future years  the company will continue to record a valuation allowance against recorded net deferred tax assets at a level deemed appropriate by management 
accounting for gift card liability the company sells gift cards that are redeemable only for merchandise and have no expiration date 
the company adjusts card liability when either customers redeem cards  at which point the company records revenue  or when the company determines it does not have a legal obligation to remit unredeemed cards to the relevant jurisdictions and the likelihood of the cards being redeemed becomes remote  at which point the company records breakage as a credit to sg a expenses 
the company s accounting for gift cards is based on estimating the company s liability for future card redemptions at the end of a reporting period 
estimated liability is equal to the most recent two years of unredeemed cards  plus an amount for outstanding cards that may possibly be redeemed for the cumulative look back period  exclusive of the last two years 
the company s ability to reasonably and reliably estimate the liability is based on historical redemption experience with gift cards and similar types of arrangements and the existence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 
the company s estimate is not susceptible to significant external factors and the circumstances around gift card sales and redemptions have not changed significantly over time 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
effective june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income  requiring entities to report components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements of net income and other comprehensive income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not hold any financial instruments that expose it to significant market risk and does not engage in hedging activities 
to the extent the company borrows under its revolving credit facility  the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations since interest on the company s borrowings under its credit facility can be variable 
if interest rates on the company s revolving credit facility were to increase by basis points  and to the extent borrowings were outstanding  for every  outstanding on the facility  income before income taxes would be reduced by  per year
