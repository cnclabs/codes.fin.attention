in  our acquisition in the third quarter of infrastructure asset management solutions provider fame expanded our asset planning consulting and software services offerings and our geographical position in western canada 
energy savings performance and energy supply contracts for our energy efficiency projects  we typically enter into energy savings performance contracts  or espcs  under which we agree to develop  design  engineer and construct a project and also commit that the project will satisfy agreed upon 
table of contents performance standards that vary from project to project 
these performance commitments are typically based on the design  capacity  efficiency or operation of the specific equipment and systems we install 
our commitments generally fall into three categories pre agreed  equipment level and whole building level 
under a pre agreed energy reduction commitment  our customer reviews the project design in advance and agrees that  upon or shortly after completion of installation of the specified equipment comprising the project  the commitment will have been met 
under an equipment level commitment  we commit to a level of energy use reduction based on the difference in use measured first with the existing equipment and then with the replacement equipment 
a whole building level commitment requires demonstration of energy usage reduction for a whole building  often based on readings of the utility meter where usage is measured 
depending on the project  the measurement and demonstration may be required only once  upon installation  based on an analysis of one or more sample installations  or may be required to be repeated at agreed upon intervals generally over up to years 
under our contracts  we typically do not take responsibility for a wide variety of factors outside our control and exclude or adjust for such factors in commitment calculations 
these factors include variations in energy prices and utility rates  weather  facility occupancy schedules  the amount of energy using equipment in a facility  and the failure of the customer to operate or maintain the project properly 
typically  our performance commitments apply to the aggregate overall performance of a project rather than to individual energy efficiency measures 
therefore  to the extent an individual measure underperforms  it may be offset by other measures that overperform during the same period 
in the event that an energy efficiency project does not perform according to the agreed upon specifications  our agreements typically allow us to satisfy our obligation by adjusting or modifying the installed equipment  installing additional measures to provide substitute energy savings  or paying the customer for lost energy savings based on the assumed conditions specified in the agreement 
many of our equipment supply  local design  and installation subcontracts contain provisions that enable us to seek recourse against our vendors or subcontractors if there is a deficiency in our energy reduction commitment 
from our inception to december   our total payments to customers and incurred costs under our energy reduction commitments  after customer acceptance of a project  have been less than  in the aggregate 
see we may have liability to our customers under our espcs if our projects fail to deliver the energy use reductions to which we are committed under the contract in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
payments by the federal government for energy efficiency measures are based on the services provided and the products installed  but are limited to the savings derived from such measures  calculated in accordance with federal regulatory guidelines and the specific contract s terms 
the savings are typically determined by comparing energy use and other costs before and after the installation of the energy efficiency measures  adjusted for changes that affect energy use and other costs but are not caused by the energy efficiency measures 
for projects involving the construction of a small scale renewable energy plant that we own and operate  we enter into long term contracts to supply the electricity  processed landfill gas  or lfg  heat or cooling generated by the plant to the customer  which is typically a utility  municipality  industrial facility or other large purchaser of energy 
the rights to use the site for the plant and purchase of renewable fuel for the plant are also obtained by us under long term agreements with terms at least as long as the associated output supply agreement 
our supply agreements typically provide for fixed prices or prices that escalate at a fixed rate or vary based on a market benchmark 
see we may assume responsibility under customer contracts for factors outside our control  including  in connection with some customer projects  the risk that fuel prices will increase in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
project financing to finance projects with federal governmental agencies  we typically sell to third party lenders our right to receive a portion of the long term payments from the customer arising out of the project for a purchase price reflecting a discount to the aggregate amount due from the customer 
the purchase price is generally advanced to us over the implementation period based on completed work or a schedule predetermined to coincide with the construction of the project 
under the terms of these financing arrangements  we are required to complete the construction or installation of the project in accordance with the contract with our customer  and the debt remains on our consolidated balance sheet until the completed project is accepted by the customer 
once the completed project is accepted by the customer  the financing is treated as a true sale and the related receivable and financing liability are removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
institutional customers  such as state  provincial and local governments  schools and public housing authorities  typically finance their energy efficiency and renewable energy projects through either tax exempt leases or issuances of municipal bonds 
we assist in the structuring of such third party financing 

table of contents in some instances  customers prefer that we retain ownership of the renewable energy plants and related project assets that we construct for them 
in these projects  we typically enter into a long term supply agreement to furnish electricity  gas  heat or cooling to the customer s facility 
to finance the significant upfront capital costs required to develop and construct the plant  we rely either on our internal cash flow or  in some cases  third party debt 
for project financing by third party lenders  we typically establish a separate subsidiary  usually a limited liability company  to own the project assets and related contracts 
the subsidiary contracts with us for construction and operation of the project and enters into a financing agreement directly with the lenders 
additionally  we will provide assurance to the lender that the project will achieve commercial operation 
although the financing is secured by the assets of the subsidiary and a pledge of our equity interests in the subsidiary  and is non recourse to ameresco  inc  we may from time to time determine to provide financial support to the subsidiary in order to maintain rights to the project or otherwise avoid the adverse consequences of a default 
the amount of such financing is included on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition to project related debt  we currently maintain a million senior secured credit facility with a group of commercial banks to finance our working capital needs 
see senior secured credit facility revolver and term loan below 
effects of seasonality we are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles  particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months  such as the northern united states and canada  or at educational institutions  where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied 
in addition  government customers  many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours  typically follow annual procurement cycles and appropriate funds on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 
further  government contracting cycles can be affected by the timing of  and delays in  the legislative process related to government programs and incentives that help drive demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects 
as a result  our revenue and operating income in the third quarter are typically higher  and our revenue and operating income in the first quarter are typically lower  than in other quarters of the year 
as a result of such fluctuations  we may occasionally experience declines in revenue or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter  and comparisons of our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
our annual and quarterly financial results are also subject to significant fluctuations as a result of other factors  many of which are outside our control 
see our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may fall below expectations in any particular fiscal quarter in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
backlog and awarded projects total construction backlog represents projects that are active within our espc sales cycle 
our sales cycle begins with the initial contact with the customer and ends  when successful  with a signed contract  also referred to as fully contracted backlog 
historically  our sales cycle typically has averaged to months 
awarded backlog is created when a potential customer awards a project to ameresco following a request for proposal 
once a project is awarded but not yet contracted  we typically conduct a detailed energy audit to determine the scope of the project as well as identify the savings that may be expected to be generated from upgrading the customer s energy infrastructure 
at this point  we also determine the sub contractor  what equipment will be used  and assist in arranging for third party financing  as applicable 
historically  awarded projects typically have taken to months to result in a signed contract and thus convert to fully contracted backlog 
it may take longer  however  depending upon the size and complexity of the project 
further  at times in the past we have experienced periods during which the portion of the sales cycle for converting awarded projects to signed contracts has lengthened 
recently  we have been experiencing an unusually sustained lengthening of conversion times 
continued us federal fiscal uncertainty not only has contributed to a lengthening of our sales cycle for us federal projects  but also has adversely affected both municipal and commercial customers across most geographic regions 
we have observed among our existing and prospective customer base increased scrutiny of decisions about spending and about incurring debt to finance projects 
for example  we have observed increased use of outside consultants and advisors  as well as adoption of additional approval steps  by many of our customers  which has resulted in a lengthening of the sales cycle 
we expect this trend to continue into after the customer and ameresco agree to the terms of the contract and the contract for the project is executed  the project moves to fully contracted backlog 
the contracts reflected in our fully contracted backlog typically have a construction period of to months and we typically expect to recognize revenue for such contracts over the same period 
fully contracted backlog begins converting into revenue generated from backlog on a percentage of completion basis once construction has commenced 
see we may not recognize all revenue from our backlog or receive all payments anticipated under awarded projects and customer contracts and in order to secure contracts for new projects  we typically face a long and variable selling cycle that requires 
table of contents significant resource commitments and requires a long lead time before we realize revenue in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
as of december   we had backlog of approximately million in expected future revenue under signed customer contracts for the installation or construction of projects  which we sometimes refer to as fully contracted backlog  and we also had been awarded projects for which we do not yet have signed customer contracts with estimated total future revenue of an additional billion 
as of december   we had fully contracted backlog of approximately million in future revenue under signed customer contracts for the installation or construction of projects  and we also had been awarded projects for which we had not yet signed customer contracts with estimated total future revenue of an additional million 
financial operations overview revenue we derive revenue from energy efficiency and renewable energy products and services 
our energy efficiency products and services include the design  engineering and installation of equipment and other measures to improve the efficiency and control the operation of a facility s energy infrastructure 
our renewable energy products and services include the construction of small scale plants that produce electricity  gas  heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy  the sale of such electricity  processed lfg  heat or cooling from plants that we own  which  for those plants that we own and operate  we refer to collectively as small scale infrastructure  and the sale and installation of photovoltaic solar energy products and systems  or integrated pv 
while in any particular quarter a single customer may account for more than ten percent of revenue  for the years ended december  and  no customer accounted for more than ten percent of our revenue 
during the year ended december   one customer  the us department of energy  savannah river site  accounted for of our total revenue 
direct expenses and gross margin direct expenses include the cost of labor  materials  equipment  subcontracting and outside engineering that are required for the development and installation of our projects  as well as preconstruction costs  sales incentives  associated travel  inventory obsolescence charges  amortization of intangible assets related to customer contracts  and  if applicable  costs of procuring financing 
a majority of our contracts have fixed price terms  however  in some cases we negotiate protections  such as a cost plus structure  to mitigate the risk of rising prices for materials  services and equipment 
direct expenses also include o m costs for the small scale renewable energy plants that we own  including the cost of fuel if any and depreciation charges 
as a result of our acquisitions in and  we have intangible assets related to customer contracts  these are amortized over a period of approximately one to five years from the respective date of acquisition 
this amortization is recorded as a direct expense for energy efficiency 
amortization expense for the years ended december  and related to customer contracts was million and million  respectively  and is included in energy efficiency expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
gross margin  which is gross profit as a percent of revenue  is affected by a number of factors  including the type of services performed and the geographic region in which the sale is made 
renewable energy projects that we own and operate typically have higher margins than energy efficiency projects  and sales in the united states typically have higher margins than in canada due to the typical mix of products and services that we sell there 
in addition  gross margin frequently varies across the construction period of a project 
our expected gross margin on  and expected revenue for  a project are based on budgeted costs 
from time to time  a portion of the contingencies reflected in budgeted costs are not incurred due to strong execution performance 
in that case  and generally at project completion  we recognize revenue for which there is no further corresponding direct expense 
as a result  gross margin tends to be back loaded for projects with strong execution performance  this explains the gross margin improvement that occurs from time to time at project closeout 
we refer to this gross margin improvement at the time of project completion as a project closeout 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits  project development costs  and general  administrative and other expenses 

table of contents salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits consist primarily of expenses for personnel not directly engaged in specific project or revenue generating activity 
these expenses include the time of executive management  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  information technology and other staff not utilized in a particular project 
we employ a comprehensive time card system which creates a contemporaneous record of the actual time by employees on project activity 
we expect salaries and benefits to continue to increase on a year over year basis as we continue to incur additional costs related to operating as a publicly traded company  including accounting  compliance and legal  as well as related to executing our growth plans 
project development costs 
project development costs consist primarily of sales  engineering  legal  finance and third party expenses directly related to the development of a specific customer opportunity 
this also includes associated travel and marketing expenses 
we intend to hire additional sales personnel and initiate additional marketing programs as we expand into new regions or complement existing development resources 
accordingly  we expect that our project development costs will continue to increase on a year over year basis  but will moderate as a percentage of revenue over time 
general  administrative and other expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of rents and occupancy  professional services  insurance  unallocated travel expenses  telecommunications  office expenses and amortization of intangible assets not related to customer contracts 
professional services consist principally of recruiting costs  external legal  audit  tax and other consulting services 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase on a year over year basis as we continue to incur additional costs related to operating as a publicly traded company 
for the year ended december   we recorded million relating to a gain on sale of an asset 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded amortization expense of million and million  respectively  related to customer relationships  non compete agreements  technology and trade names 
amortization expense related to these intangible assets is included in general  administrative and other expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
goodwill impairment 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of december  for all reporting units 
this test  which was based on our most recent cash flow forecast  indicated that canada goodwill related to the byrne acquisition acquired in november  was determined to be likely impaired as the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash  non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million during the year ended december  other expenses  net other expenses  net consists primarily of interest income on cash balances  interest expense on borrowings and amortization of deferred financing costs  and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for as hedges 
interest expense will vary periodically depending on the amounts drawn on our revolving senior secured credit facility and the prevailing short term interest rates 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on various rates set by federal and local authorities and is affected by permanent and temporary differences between financial accounting and tax reporting requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense and related disclosures 
the most significant estimates with regard to these consolidated financial statements relate to estimates of final contract profit in accordance with long term contracts  project development costs  project assets  impairment of goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  fair value of derivative financial instruments  income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
such estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are made on an ongoing basis  and accordingly  the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition for each arrangement we have with a customer  we typically provide a combination of one or more of the following services or products installation or construction of energy efficiency measures  facility upgrades and or a renewable energy plant to be owned by the customer  sale and delivery  under long term agreements  of electricity  gas  heat  chilled water or other output of a renewable energy or central plant that we own and operate  sale and delivery of photovoltaic  or pv  equipment and other renewable energy products for which we are a distributor  whether under our own brand name or for others  and o m services provided under long term o m agreements  as well as consulting services 
often  we will sell a combination of these services and products in a bundled arrangement 
we divide bundled arrangements into separate deliverables and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the relative selling price is determined using third party evidence or management s best estimate of selling price 
we recognize revenue from the installation or construction of a project on a percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion for each project is determined on an actual cost to estimated final cost basis 
in accordance with industry practice  we include in current assets and liabilities the amounts of receivables related to construction projects that are payable over a period in excess of one year 
we recognize revenue associated with contract change orders only when the authorization for the change order has been properly executed and the work has been performed and accepted by the customer 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  or claims against costs incurred reduce the likelihood of recoverability of such costs  our policy is to record the entire expected loss immediately  regardless of the percentage of completion 
deferred revenue represents circumstances where i there has been a receipt of cash from the customer for work or services that have yet to be performed  ii receipt of cash where the product or service may not have been accepted by the customer or iii when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  but an estimate of the final total cost cannot be determined 
deferred revenue will vary depending on the timing and amount of cash receipts from customers and can vary significantly depending on specific contractual terms 
as a result  deferred revenue is likely to fluctuate from period to period 
unbilled revenue  presented as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  represent amounts earned and billable that were not invoiced at the end of the fiscal period 
we recognize revenue from the sale and delivery of products  including the output of our renewable energy plants  when produced and delivered to the customer  in accordance with the specific contract terms  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from o m contracts and consulting services as the related services are performed 
for a limited number of contracts under which we receive additional revenue based on a share of energy savings  we recognize such additional revenue as energy savings are generated 
project development costs we capitalize as project development costs only those costs incurred in connection with the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects  primarily direct labor  interest costs  outside contractor services  consulting fees  legal fees and associated travel  if incurred after a point in time when the realization of related revenue becomes probable 
project development costs incurred prior to the probable realization of revenue are expensed as incurred 
project assets we capitalize interest costs relating to construction financing during the period of construction 
the interest capitalized is included in the total cost of the project at completion 
the amount of interest capitalized for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
routine maintenance costs are expensed in the current year s consolidated statements of income to the extent that they do not extend the life of the asset 
major maintenance  upgrades and overhauls are required for certain components of our assets 
in these instances  the costs associated with these upgrades are capitalized and are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the 
table of contents asset or until the next required major maintenance or overhaul period 
gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment are reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows before interest associated with the expected uses and eventual disposition of those assets 
when these comparisons indicate that the carrying value of those assets is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we apply asc  intangibles goodwill and other  in accounting for the valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
during our annual goodwill impairment tests at december  and  we determined that the fair value of the enterprise value equity value plus debt less cash exceeded the carrying value of the enterprise value for all reporting units  and therefore that goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired 
during our annual goodwill impairment test at december   we determined that the fair value of the enterprise value of our canada reporting unit did not exceed the carrying value of its enterprise value  and therefore that goodwill was impaired and an impairment charge of million was recorded against the goodwill of our canada reporting unit on december   we also determined that the remainder of our goodwill and intangible assets was not impaired as of december  goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that  more likely than not  the fair value of such assets was less than their carrying values 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the base stock price of our public competitors for a sustained period of time 
the first step  or step  of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the equity with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the equity exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we performed a step test at our december   and annual testing dates and determined  with the exception of our canada reporting unit as of december   that the fair value of the enterprise value exceeded the carrying value of the enterprise value  and therefore that goodwill was not impaired 
we completed the step test using both an income approach and a market approach 
the discounted cash flow method was used to measure the fair value of our equity under the income approach 
a terminal value utilizing a constant growth rate of cash flows was used to calculate a terminal value after the explicit projection period 
determining the fair value using a discounted cash flow method requires that we make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
our judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  pipeline for future sales and other information 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  we rely on internally generated projections for a defined time period for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  changes in net working capital and adjustments for non cash items to arrive at the free cash flow available to invested capital 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable publicly traded companies and comparable transactions of similar companies 
the estimates and assumptions used in our calculations include revenue growth rates  expense growth rates  expected capital expenditures to determine projected cash flows  expected tax rates and an estimated discount rate to determine present value of expected cash flows 
these estimates are based on historical experiences  our projections of future operating activity and our weighted average cost of capital 
in addition  we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value or revised useful life 
if the step test concludes an impairment is indicated  we will employ a second step to measure the impairment 
if we determine that an 
table of contents impairment has occurred  we will record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
although we believe goodwill and intangible assets are appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
for the year ended december   during the course of our valuation analysis it was determined that the fair value of our canada segment was less than the carrying amount of this segment 
this determination prompted the performance of the step test as prescribed under asc  recognizing and measuring the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with carrying amount of the goodwill 
the fair value of this goodwill can only be measured as a residual after the entity assigns the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the carrying amount of the goodwill of our canada segment exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill and an impairment charge of million was recorded against this goodwill in the fourth quarter of impairment of long lived assets we use the guidance prescribed in asc  property  plant and equipment  for the proper testing and valuation methodology to ensure we record any impairment when the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable equivalent to an amount equal to its fair market value 
we periodically evaluate long lived asset groups for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment 
a review of long lived asset groups for impairment is performed whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
examples of such triggering events applicable to our asset groups include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset group or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group 
should an asset group be identified as potentially impaired based on the defined criteria  an impairment test is performed that includes a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset 
during  no asset group was identified as being impaired 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may be required against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
derivative financial instruments we account for our interest rate swaps as derivative financial instruments in accordance with the related guidance 
under this guidance  derivatives are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on observable market data in combination with expected cash flows for each instrument 
we follow the guidance which expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in the normal course of business  we utilize derivative contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage exposure to market fluctuations in interest rates 
these instruments are subject to various credit and market risks 
controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated 
credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value 
we seek to manage credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions only through counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy 
market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in interest rates 
we seek to manage market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through our borrowing activities 
a portion of our project financing includes four credit facilities  both project related and corporate  that utilize a variable rate swap instrument 
prior to december   we entered into two year interest rate swap contracts under which we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and to  in turn  receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 

table of contents during the year ended december   we entered into a year interest rate swap contract under which we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
in july  we entered into a five year interest rate swap contract under which we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount  and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swap covers an initial notional amount of million variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of and expires in june in october  and in connection with a construction and term loan  we entered into two eight year interest rate swap contracts under which we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swaps have an initial notional amount of million  which increases to million on september   at a fixed rate of  and expires in march in october  we also entered into two eight year forward starting interest rate swap contracts under which the company agreed to pay an amount equal to specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount  and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swaps cover an initial notional amount of million variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of  with an effective date of march   and expires in june we entered into each of the interest rate swap contracts as an economic hedge 
we recognize all derivatives in our consolidated financial statements at fair value 
the interest rate swaps that we entered into prior to december  qualified  but were not designated as cash flow hedges until april  accordingly  any changes in fair value through march  were reported in other expenses  net in our consolidated statements of income at fair value  and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income thereafter 
cash flows from these derivative instruments are reported as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the interest rate swap that we entered into in march was a floating to fixed interest rate swap 
we had accounted for this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument in accordance with asc asc requires all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  and that changes in the derivatives fair values be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the fair value of this interest rate swap agreement was adjusted quarterly with the changes recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of any applicable taxes 
we determined that this particular swap does not qualify for hedge accounting because we inappropriately applied the short cut method to evaluate this interest rate swap for hedge accounting purposes from the date of inception 
accordingly  we are required to recognize the change in the fair value of this interest rate swap derivative as a component of earnings for the periods commencing in march see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we expect to re designate the swap as a hedge under the long haul method in the first quarter of the interest rate swaps that we entered into during and qualify  and have been designated  as cash flow hedges 
we recognize the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges in our consolidated balance sheets and any changes in the fair value are recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the liability method 
we provide for deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities calculated using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for an uncertain tax position can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally 
table of contents extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
business segments we report four segments us federal  central us region  other us regions and canada 
each segment provides customers with energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions 
the other us regions segment is an aggregation of four regions northeast us  southeast us  southwest us and northwest us these regions have similar economic characteristics in particular  expected and actual gross profit margins 
in addition  they sell products and services of a similar nature  serve similar types of customers and use similar methods to distribute their products and services 
accordingly  these four regions meet the aggregation criteria set forth in asc the all other category includes activities  such as o m and sales of renewable energy and certain other renewable energy products  that are managed centrally at our corporate headquarters 
it also includes all amortization of intangibles and all corporate operating expenses salaries and benefits  project development costs  and general  administrative and other not specifically allocated to the segments 
we do not allocate any indirect expenses to the segments 
stock based compensation expense our stock based compensation expense results from the issuances of shares of restricted common stock and grants of stock options to employees  directors  outside consultants and others 
we recognize the costs associated with option grants using the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
generally  asc requires the value of all stock based payments to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their estimated fair value at date of grant amortized over the grants respective vesting periods 
stock option grants we have granted stock options to certain employees and directors under our stock incentive plan  however  we will grant no further stock options or restricted stock awards under that plan 
we have also granted stock options to certain employees and directors under our stock incentive plan 
at december    shares were available for grant under that plan 
under the terms of our and stock incentive plans  all options expire if not exercised within ten years after the grant date 
historically  options generally provided for vesting over five years  with vesting at the end of the first year and five percent vesting every three months beginning one year after the grant date 
during  we began awarding options generally providing for vesting over five years  with vesting on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date 
if the employee ceases to be employed for any reason before vested options have been exercised  the employee generally has three months to exercise vested options or they are forfeited 
we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc requiring that all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and modifications to existing stock options  be recognized in the consolidated statements of income based on their fair values  using the prospective transition method 
effective with the adoption of asc  we elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 

table of contents the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the following table sets forth the significant assumptions used in the model during  and years ended december  future dividends risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life years years years we will continue to use our judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own stock based compensation on a prospective basis  and incorporating these factors into the black scholes pricing model 
higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
in addition  any changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period that the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
these expenses will affect our direct expenses  project development and marketing expenses  and salaries and benefits expense 
as of december   we had million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to employee and director stock options 
we expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average period of years after december  the allocation of this expense between direct expenses  project development and marketing expenses  and salaries and benefits expense will depend on the salaries and work assignments of the personnel holding these options

total revenue decreased by million  or  from to due to lower energy efficiency revenue  partly offset by higher renewable energy revenue 
total revenue was down from to as we experienced an unusually sustained lengthening of conversion times from awarded projects to signed contracts 
continued us federal fiscal uncertainty not only has contributed to a lengthening of our sales cycle for us federal projects  but also has adversely affected both municipal and commercial customers across most geographic regions 
we have observed among our existing and prospective customer base increased scrutiny of decisions about spending and about incurring debt to finance projects 
for example  we have observed increased use of outside consultants and advisors  as well as adoption of additional approval steps  by many of our customers  which has resulted in a lengthening of the sales cycle 
as a result  during we experienced an unusually sustained market disruption that affected all geographic regions and all levels of government 
we expect this trend to continue into total revenue increased by million  or  from to primarily due to higher energy efficiency revenue 
energy efficiency revenue 
energy efficiency revenue decreased by million or  from to declines in our us federal and canada segments  by million and million  respectively  reflect the lagged affect of delays beginning in and continuing into in converting awarded projects to signed contracts 
these decreases were partially offset by million in incremental revenue attributable to our three acquisitions completed in the second half of energy efficiency revenue increased by million  or  from to due to increased energy efficiency installation activity across all the regions in the other us regions segment as well as the canada segment  which reflects both ongoing and new projects 
energy efficiency revenue for includes approximately million attributable to our acquisitions of aeg and ameresco southwest in the third quarter of renewable energy revenue 
renewable energy revenue increased by million  or  from to primarily due to increases from developing renewable energy plants for our customers and small scale infrastructure  which more than offset a decline in revenue from renewable energy installation within the us federal segment due to completion of projects 
renewable energy revenue increased by million  or  from to  primarily due to increases from integrated pv  developing renewable energy plants for our customers and small scale infrastructure  as well as approximately million from renewable energy installation activity attributable to our acquisition of ameresco southwest in the third quarter of  partially offset by a million decline in revenue from renewable energy installation within the us federal segment beginning in the second quarter of as projects neared completion

total revenue for the us federal segment decreased from to by million  or  to million primarily due to decreases in revenues from installation activity on ongoing projects  as a number of projects began nearing completion  combined with a decline in the velocity of converting awarded projects to signed contracts beginning in late through the first half of during  revenue recognized on the continued installation of a large renewable energy project for the us department of energy  savannah river site  accounted for a significant portion of our revenue for this segment 
total revenue for the central us region segment increased from to by million  or  to million primarily due to increased installation activity as a result of an improved environment for converting awarded projects during the first half and last quarter of  partially offset by the timing of awarded conversion activity which resulted in fewer newly signed contracts during the second quarter to replace installation activity in the third quarter 
total revenue for the central us region segment decreased from to by million  or  to million  primarily due to a lengthening of the sales cycle  which had resulted in fewer signed contracts to replace installation activity as projects were completed 
total revenue for the other us regions segment decreased from to by million  or  to million primarily due to most regions within the segment experiencing a lengthening of conversion times from awarded projects to signed contracts beginning in in the third quarter  partially offset by an increase in the size and number of projects under construction in the first half  as well as million in incremental revenue attributable to our acquisition of ameresco southwest in total revenue for the other us regions segment increased from to by million  or  to million  primarily due to an increase in the size and number of projects under construction in the northeast  southeast and northwest  total revenue for this segment in includes million attributable to our acquisition of ameresco southwest in the third quarter of total revenue for the canada segment decreased from to by million  or  to million primarily due to the effects of fewer projects entering the construction phase and delays in converting both proposals to awarded projects and awarded projects to signed contracts arising from what we believe was continued government and municipal customer uncertainty related to the consequences of election outcomes 
total revenue for the canada segment increased from to by million  or  to million  primarily due to a larger volume of construction activity related to the installation of energy efficiency measures

total direct expenses decreased by million  or  from to due primarily to the decrease in energy efficiency revenue  partially offset by improved gross margin for both energy efficiency and renewable energy 
total direct expenses increased by million  or  from to due primarily to increases associated with increased installation activity and  to a lesser extent  an increase in amortization of intangible assets resulting from our two acquisitions during the third quarter of  partially offset by higher energy efficiency gross profit margin as discussed below 
energy efficiency gross margin 
energy efficiency gross margin increased from in to in the increase was driven by higher margin projects across a number of us regions  project closeouts  which contribute revenue for which all related direct expenses previously have been incurred  and contributions from our higher gross margin offerings attributable to our acquisitions of aeg and ais in the second half of energy efficiency gross margin increased from in to in primarily due to higher gross margins related to several project closeouts and positive margin contribution form aeg and ameresco southwest 
renewable energy gross margin 
renewable energy gross margin increased from in to in primarily due to small scale infrastructure and integrated pv

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on various rates set by federal  state  provincial and local authorities and is affected by permanent and temporary differences between financial accounting and tax reporting requirements 
our statutory rate  which is a combined federal and state rate  has ranged between and 
during  we recognized income taxes of million  or of pretax income 
the principal difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate was due to deductions permitted under section d of the code  which relate to the installation of certain energy efficiency equipment in federal  state  provincial and local government owned buildings  as well as production tax credits to which we are entitled from the electricity generated by certain plants that we own

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since inception  we have funded operations primarily through existing net cash available  cash flow from operations and various forms of debt 
we consider the difference between cash and cash equivalents and the book overdraft to represent the net cash available to meet our liquidity requirements 
those amounts were as follows for the years ended december   and fiscal years ended december  in s cash and cash equivalents book overdraft net cash available at december   we recorded a book overdraft which represents certain checks issued on a disbursement bank account but not yet paid by that bank 
accounting conventions require that the book overdraft be presented as a current liability 
there were no book overdrafts as of december  or we presented the book overdraft as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows

we reflect restricted cash as an operating asset on our consolidated balance sheet and withdrawals from existing restricted cash accounts as cash flow from operations on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the creation of new restricted cash accounts is reflected as a decrease to cash flows from financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
certain of the cash generated from our us federal espc receivable financing is held in restricted cash accounts to be used to pay for the cost of construction under our us federal espcs 
we withdrew million in cash from these accounts during in addition  under the terms of our term loan agreements used to finance certain of our renewable energy projects  we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts to provide for operation and maintenance expenses incurred 
we withdrew million in cash from these accounts during cash flows from investing activities

the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to an additional million at our option  if the lenders agree 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of million  with the balance due at maturity 
ameresco  inc remains the sole borrower under the credit facility 
the new credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets other than renewable energy projects that we own that were financed by others  and limits our ability to enter into other financing arrangements 
availability under the revolving credit facility is based on two times our ebitda for the preceding four quarters  and we are required to maintain a minimum ebitda of million on a rolling four quarter basis 
the new credit facility matures on june   when all amounts will be due and payable in full 
project financing construction and term loans 
we have entered into a number of construction and term loan agreements for the purpose of constructing and owning certain renewable energy plants 
the physical assets and the operating agreements related to the renewable energy plants are owned by wholly owned  single member special purpose subsidiaries 
these construction and term loans are structured as project financings made directly to a subsidiary  and upon acceptance of a project  the related construction loan converts into a term loan 
while we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to reflect these loans as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  they are generally nonrecourse and not direct obligations of ameresco  inc as of december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount under these loans  bearing interest at rates ranging from to and maturing at various dates from to one loan totaling million  does require ameresco  inc to provide assurance to the lender of the project performance 
a second loan  entered into during  totaling million requires ameresco  inc to provide assurance to the lender of construction completion with respect to those projects still in construction and of reimbursement upon any recapture of certain renewable energy government cash grants upon the occurrence of events that cause the recapture of such grants

we have arrangements with certain lenders to provide advances to us during the construction or installation of projects for certain customers  typically federal governmental entities  in exchange for our assignment to the lenders of our rights to the long term receivables arising from the espcs related to such projects 
these financings totaled million and million in principal amounts at december  and  respectively 
under the terms of these financing arrangements  we are required to complete the construction or installation of the project in accordance with the contract with our customer  and the debt remains on our consolidated balance sheet until the completed project is accepted by the customer 
our revolving senior secured credit facility and construction and term loan agreements require us to comply with a variety of financial and operational covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of our financial and operational covenants 
in addition  we do not consider it likely that we will fail to comply with these covenants during the term of these agreements

this asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with codification subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in us and canadian dollars 
changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flows and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million as of december  and million as of december  our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest expense paid on our senior secured credit facility 
derivative instruments we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  through our subsidiaries we do enter into derivative instruments for purposes other than trading purposes 
certain of the term loans that we use to finance our renewable energy projects bear variable interest rates that are indexed to short term market rates 
we have entered into interest rate swaps in connection with these term loans in order to seek to hedge our exposure to adverse changes in the applicable short term market rate 
in some instances  the conditions of our renewable energy project term loans require us to enter into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate our exposure to adverse movements in market interest rates 
the interest rate swaps that we have entered into qualify and  with one exception  have been designated as fair value hedges 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
the fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs  including interest rate yield curves  and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes us  thus creating a receivable risk for us 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our derivative agreements 
we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating 
our exposure to market interest rate risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 
foreign currency risk as a result of our operations in canada  we have significant expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency 
also  a significant number of employees are located in canada and we transact a significant amount of business in canadian currency 
consequently  we have determined that canadian currency is the functional currency for our 
table of contents canadian operations 
when we consolidate the operations of our canadian subsidiary into our financial results  because we report our results in us dollars  we are required to translate the financial results and position of our canadian subsidiary from canadian currency into us dollars 
we translate the revenues  expenses  gains  and losses from our canadian subsidiary into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate for the applicable fiscal period 
we translate the assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiary into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income for the period but are disclosed and accumulated in a separate component of consolidated equity until sale or until a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in our canadian subsidiary takes place 
changes in the values of these items from one period to the next which result from exchange rate fluctuations are recorded in our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for the year ended december   due to changes in the us canadian exchange rate that were favorable to the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar  our foreign currency translation resulted in a gain of million which we recorded as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   due to changes in the us canadian exchange rate that were unfavorable to the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar  our foreign currency translation resulted in a loss of million  respectively  which we recorded as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a consequence  gross profit  operating results  profitability and cash flows are impacted by relative changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
we have not repatriated earnings from our canadian subsidiary  but have elected to invest in new business opportunities there 
we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk
