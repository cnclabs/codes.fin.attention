item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or contemplated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the headings forward looking statements  and risk factors  elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business we are one of the leading commercial real estate finance companies in the united states  with a primary focus on multifamily lending 
we originate  sell and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products 
our clients are owners and developers of commercial real estate across the country 
we originate and sell loans through the programs of fannie mae  freddie mac  ginnie mae  and hud  with which we have long established relationships 
we retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on nearly all loans that we originate for gse and hud programs 
we are approved as a fannie mae dus lender nationally  a freddie mac program plus lender in states and the district of columbia  a freddie mac targeted affordable housing seller servicer  a hud map lender nationally  a hud lean lender nationally  and a ginnie mae issuer 
we also originate and service loans for a number of life insurance companies  commercial banks and other institutional investors  in which cases we do not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker 
additionally  through our subsidiary entities  we provide institutional advisory  asset management and investment management services specializing in debt  structured debt and equity 
we fund loans for gse and hud programs  generally through warehouse facility financings  and sell them to investors in accordance with the related loan sale commitment  which we obtain prior to loan closing 
proceeds from the sale of the loan are used to pay off the warehouse facility 
the sale of the loan is typically completed within days after the loan is closed 
in cases where we do not fund the loan  we act as a loan broker and service some of the loans 
our loan originators who focus on loan brokerage are engaged by borrowers to work with a variety of institutional lenders to find the most appropriate loan instrument for the borrowers needs 
these loans are then funded directly by the institutional lender and we receive an origination fee for placing the loan and a servicing fee for any loans we service 
we recognize gains from mortgage banking activities when we commit to both make a loan to a borrower and sell that loan to an investor 
the gains from mortgage banking activities reflect the fair value attributable to loan origination fees  premiums or losses on the sale of loans  net of any co broker fees  and the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the servicing of loans  net of any guaranty obligations retained 
we also generate revenue from net warehouse interest income we earn while the loan is held for sale in one of our warehouse facilities 
we retain servicing rights on substantially all of the loans we originate and sell  and generate revenues from the fees we receive for servicing the loans  interest income from escrow deposits held on behalf of borrowers  late charges and other ancillary fees 
servicing fees are set at the time an investor agrees to purchase the loan and are generally paid monthly for the duration of the loan 
our fannie mae and freddie mac servicing arrangements generally provide for prepayment penalties to the company in the event of a voluntary prepayment 
for loans serviced outside of fannie mae and freddie mac  we typically do not share in any such prepayments 
we are currently not exposed to interest rate risk during the loan commitment  closing and delivery process 
the sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated prior to establishing the coupon rate for the loan 
we also seek to mitigate the risk of a loan not closing 
we have 
table of contents agreements in place with investors that specify the cost of a failed loan delivery  also known as a pair off fee  in the event we fail to deliver the loan or security to the investor 
the pair off fee is typically less than the deposit we collect from the borrower 
any potential loss from a catastrophic change in the property condition while the loan is held for sale using warehouse facility financing is mitigated through property insurance equal to replacement cost 
we have experienced only two failed loan deliveries in our history as a dus lender and did not incur a material loss 
we have risk sharing obligations on most loans we originate under the fannie mae dus program 
when a fannie mae dus loan is subject to full risk sharing  we absorb losses on the first of the unpaid principal balance of a loan  and above we share a percentage of the loss with fannie mae  with our maximum loss capped at of the unpaid principal balance of a loan subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within months of its sale to fannie mae 
we may  however  request modified risk sharing at the time of origination  which reduces our potential risk sharing losses from the levels described above 
we regularly request modified risk sharing based on such factors as the size of the loan  market conditions and loan pricing 
we may also request modified risk sharing on large transactions if we do not believe that we are being fully compensated for the risks of the transactions or to manage overall risk levels 
except for certain fannie mae dus loans acquired in the acquisition  which were acquired subject to their existing fannie mae dus risk sharing levels  our current credit management policy is to cap each loan balance subject to full risk sharing at million 
accordingly  we currently elect to use modified risk sharing for loans of more than million in order to limit our maximum loss exposure on any one loan to million such exposure would occur in the event that the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss 
our servicing fees for risk sharing loans include compensation for the risk sharing obligations and are larger than the servicing fees we receive from fannie mae for loans with no risk sharing obligations  from freddie mac for loans originated under program plus  and from hud for loans originated under map 
we receive a lower servicing fee for modified risk sharing than for full risk sharing 
in december  we completed our initial public offering  pursuant to which we sold  shares and selling stockholders sold  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  resulting in gross proceeds to the company of million 
the offering was completed on december  we received net proceeds of million from the initial public offering after deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and other accrued offering costs 
in connection with our ipo  we completed the formation transaction through which walker dunlop  llc became a wholly owned subsidiary of walker dunlop  inc  a newly formed maryland corporation 
in connection with the formation transaction  members of the walker family  certain of our directors and executive officers and certain other individuals and entities who owned direct and indirect equity interests in walker dunlop  llc contributed their respective interests in such entities to walker dunlop  inc in exchange for shares of our common stock 
our predecessor entities have historically operated as pass through tax entities partnerships  llcs and s corporations 
accordingly  our historical earnings have resulted in only nominal federal and state corporate level expense 
the tax liability has been the obligation of our owners 
upon closing our initial public offering on december   our income became subject to both federal and state corporate tax 
as a result of the formation transaction and change in tax status  we recognized net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding deferred tax expense on the date of our change in status  and recognized income tax expense for the days following the our change in tax status 
on january   we issued an additional  shares of common stock at per share upon the partial exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million 

table of contents in july  we launched our interim loan program that offers floating rate debt  for terms of up to two years  to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing 
we closed our first loan under this program in february under this program  we underwrite the loans originated through the program  and during the time that they are outstanding  we assume the full risk of loss on the loans 
in addition  we service and asset manage loans originated through the program  with the ultimate goal of providing permanent financing on the properties 
on june   the company entered into the purchase agreement  by and among the company  its indirect wholly owned subsidiary  walker dunlop  llc  cwcapital and cw financial  pursuant to which walker dunlop  llc agreed to acquire all of cw financial interests in cwcapital  for approximately million comprising a cash payment to cw financial of million and the balance consisting of the company issuance in a private placement to cw financial of approximately million shares of common stock 
the acquisition closed  pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  on september  upon closing of the acquisition  cwcapital became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company and was renamed walker dunlop capital  llc 
the consideration transferred at the close of the acquisition totaled approximately million  consisting of million in cash and  shares of the company common stock at a closing date fair value of approximately million 
the increase in the fair value of the consideration transferred is the result of an increase in the fair value of the company common stock from execution of the purchase agreement to the closing date 
by virtue of the company ownership of cwcapital  the company also acquired a ownership in ara finance llc  a joint venture with ara finco llc  in which ara finco llc owns the remaining of ara finance llc 
the company accounts for its investment in ara finance llc under the equity method of accounting 
cwcapital  a massachusetts limited liability company  was one of the leading commercial real estate finance companies in the united states  with a primary focus on multifamily lending  originating and selling mortgage loans pursuant to the programs of fannie mae  freddie mac  ginnie mae and hud 
cwcapital had approximately employees in offices nationwide 
the acquisition combined two of the leading commercial real estate lenders in the country to form one of the largest commercial real estate lenders in the country 
the acquisition increased our servicing portfolio by billion and significantly increased our origination capacity 
as of december   our servicing portfolio was billion  up from december  and the th largest commercial multifamily primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the mortgage bankers association year end survey the survey 
our servicing portfolio includes billion of loans serviced for the gses  making us the rd largest primary and master servicer of gse loans in the nation according to the survey 
also included in our servicing portfolio is billion of hud loans  the th largest hud primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the survey 
due to our own organic growth and the increased capacity from the acquisition  our origination volume increased  from a total of billion during to a total of billion during fannie mae recently announced that we ranked as its largest dus lender in  by loan deliveries  and freddie mac recently announced that we ranked as its th largest seller servicer in  by loan deliveries 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
prior to the formation transaction  the financial results of 
table of contents operations include the consolidated financial results of all wholly owned subsidiaries of walker dunlop  inc and entities under common control  which became wholly owned subsidiaries of walker dunlop  inc in completing the formation transaction and closing of our initial public offering 
concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering in december  the investors in the walker dunlop predecessor entities individually and collectively combined the predecessor entities which had been previously operated and reported as companies under common control 
these investors exchanged their member interests for their pro rata interest  adjusted for company specific debt included in the transaction  in  shares in the newly formed company 
this transaction was reported for accounting purposes as a combination of companies under common control and the stock issuance was reported as a stock split 
in accordance with us gaap  all financial reports have been prepared as if the stock split and the combination of the companies under common control had occurred prior to the earliest period presented  certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
use of financial measures to supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap  we use the following non gaap financial measures pro forma net income pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share adjusted net income adjusted earnings per diluted share adjusted total expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for  or superior to  the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap 
for more information on these non gaap financial measures  refer to the following reconciliation of income from operations to pro forma net income  included in our selected financial data above and in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and adjusted financial metrics reconciliation to gaap  included in the operating results below and in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
pro forma net income adjusts income from operations  as reported  by applying our estimated effective federal and state income tax rates as if we were a corporate tax payer for the comparable periods in   and management uses this non gaap measure in comparing the company operating results with historical performance and believes it provides meaningful and comparable information to management and investors to assist in their review of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors 
the adjusted metrics exclude acquisition and integration costs specifically related to the cwcapital acquisition  and amortization of customer contracts and other intangible assets acquired from cwcapital 
the company believes that these non gaap measures facilitate a review of the comparability of the company operating performance on a period to period basis because such costs are not  in our view  related to the company ongoing operational performance 
we use non gaap 
table of contents measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business  for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans  and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap  and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies 
we believe that these non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the company results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measures 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
mortgage servicing rights and guaranty obligations 
msrs are recorded at fair value the day we sell a loan 
we only recognize msrs for gse and hud originations 
our servicing contracts with non governmental originations are cancelable with limited notice and as a result  have a de minimis fair value 
the fair value is based on estimates of future net cash flows associated with the servicing rights 
the estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the msr over the estimated life of the underlying loan 
in addition to the msr  for all fannie mae dus loans with risk sharing obligations  upon sale we record the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guaranty non contingent obligation  and the fair value of the expected loss from the risk sharing obligations in the event of a borrower default contingent obligation 
in determining the fair value of the guaranty obligation  we consider the risk profile of the collateral  historical loss experience  and various market indicators 
generally  the estimated fair value of the guaranty obligation is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be paid under the guaranty over the life of the loan historically three to five basis points annually  discounted using a discount rate 
historically  the contingent obligation recognized has been de minimis 
the estimated life and discount rate used to calculate the guaranty obligation are consistent with those used to calculate the corresponding msr 
the msr and associated guaranty obligation are amortized into expense over the estimated life of the loan 
the msr is amortized in proportion to  and over the period  that net servicing income is expected to be received 
the guaranty obligation is amortized evenly over the same period 
if a loan defaults and is not expected to become current or pays off prior to the estimated life  the unamortized msr and guaranty obligation balances are written off through the income statement 
we carry the msrs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and evaluate the carrying value on a portfolio basis quarterly 
we engage a third party to assist in valuing our msrs on a semi annual basis 
allowance for risk sharing obligations 
the amount of the allowance considers our assessment of the likelihood of payment by the borrower or key principal s  the estimated disposition value of the underlying collateral  and the level of risk sharing 
historically  initial loss recognition occurs at or before the loan becoming days delinquent 
we regularly monitor our risk sharing obligations on all loans and update loss estimates as current information is received 

table of contents goodwill 
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting  under which the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date 
we recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed both specific and contingent at their fair values at the acquisition date 
furthermore  acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
we do not amortize goodwill  instead  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition to our annual impairment evaluation  we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred in the period subsequent to our annual impairment testing which indicate that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has occurred 
intangible assets 
we evaluate our identified intangibles for impairment annually or if other events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
overview of current business environment during  us multifamily market fundamentals continued their improvement following the macroeconomic instability experienced in recent years 
occupancy rates and effective rents appear to have increased based upon increased rental market demand  both of which aid loan performance due to their importance to the cash flows of the underlying properties 
despite this improvement in some market fundamentals  recovery of the overall real estate market continues to be challenged by the slow recovery of the broader economy 
the passage of dodd frank introduced complex  comprehensive legislation into the financial and real estate recoveries  which will have far reaching effects on the industry and its participants 
while we are not a banking institution  there is uncertainty as to how  in the coming years  dodd frank may affect us or our competitors 
in addition  the scope  extent and timing of gse reform continues to be uncertain 
although we cannot predict what actions congress or other governmental agencies may take affecting the gses and or hud  we expect some regulatory change is likely 
in the interim  the gses and hud continue to supply a significant level of capital to the multifamily market and are expected to continue to do so as commercial and multifamily debt refinancing activity is expected to increase 
hurricane sandy hit the united states coast in late october  causing substantial damage to the mid atlantic and northeastern united states 
the hurricane had a major impact to the economies of the areas hit the hardest 
although we have a significant presence in the mid atlantic and northeastern united states  our financial results were not impacted by hurricane sandy 
factors that may impact our operating results we believe that our results are affected by a number of factors  including the items discussed below 
performance of multifamily and other commercial real estate related markets 
our business is dependent on the general demand for  and value of  commercial real estate and related services  which are sensitive to economic conditions 
demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during stronger economic environments  resulting in increased property values  transaction volumes and loan origination volumes 
during weaker economic environments  multifamily and other commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies  lower demand and reduced values 
these conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations  as well as an increased level of servicer advances and losses from our fannie mae dus risk sharing obligations 
the level of losses from fannie mae risk sharing obligations 
under the fannie mae dus program  we share risk of loss on most loans we sell 
in the majority of cases  we absorb the first 
table of contents of any losses on the unpaid principal balance of a loan  and above we share a percentage of the loss with fannie mae  with our maximum loss capped at of the unpaid principal balance of a loan subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within months of its sale to fannie mae 
as a result  a continuing rise in delinquencies could have a material adverse effect on us 
the price of loans in the secondary market 
our profitability is determined in part by the price we are paid for the loans we originate 
a component of our origination related revenues is the premium we recognize on the sale of a loan 
stronger investor demand typically results in larger premiums while weaker demand results in little to no premium 
market for servicing commercial real estate loans 
service fee rates for new loans are set at the time we enter into a loan sale commitment based on origination volumes  competition  prepayment rates and any risk sharing obligations we undertake 
changes in future service fee rates impact the value of our future msrs and future servicing revenues  which could impact our profit margins and operating results over time 
revenues gains from mortgage banking activities 
mortgage banking activity income is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the commitment to both originate a loan with a borrower and sell to an investor 
the commitment asset is recognized at fair value  which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and sale premiums  net of co broker fees  the estimated fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan and the estimated fair value of guaranty obligations to be retained 
also included in gains from mortgage banking activities are changes to the fair value of loan commitments  forward sale commitments  and loans held for sale that occur during their respective holding periods 
upon sale of the loans  no gains or losses are recognized as such loans are recorded at fair value during their holding periods 
msrs and guaranty obligations are recognized as assets and liabilities  respectively  upon the sale of the loans 
loans originated in a brokerage capacity tend to have lower origination fees because they often require less time to execute  there is more competition for brokerage assignments  and because the borrower will also have to pay an origination fee to the ultimate institutional lender 
premiums received on the sale of a loan result when a loan is sold to an investor for more than its face value 
there are various reasons investors may pay a premium when purchasing a loan 
for example  the fixed rate on the loan may be higher than the rate of return required by an investor or the characteristics of a particular loan may be desirable to an investor 
we do not receive premiums on loans originated in a brokerage capacity  unless we are the lender 
msrs are recorded at fair value the day we sell a loan 
the fair value is based on estimates of future net cash flows associated with the servicing rights 
the estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the msr over the estimated life of the loan 
servicing fees 
we service nearly all loans we originate 
we earn servicing fees for performing certain loan servicing functions  such as processing loans  tax  and insurance payments and managing escrow balances 
servicing also includes asset management functions  such as monitoring the physical condition of the property  analyzing the financial condition and liquidity of the borrower and performing loss mitigation activities as directed by the gses and hud 

table of contents our servicing fees on loans we originate provide a stable revenue stream 
they are based on contractual terms  are earned over the life of the loan and are generally not subject to prepayment risk 
our fannie mae and freddie mac servicing agreements provide for make whole payments in the event of a voluntary prepayment 
accordingly  we currently do not hedge our servicing portfolio for prepayment risk 
any make whole payments received are included in other income 
hud has the right to terminate our current servicing engagements for cause 
in addition to termination for cause  fannie mae and freddie mac may terminate our servicing engagements without cause by paying a termination fee 
our institutional investors typically may terminate our servicing engagements at any time with or without cause  without paying a termination fee 
net warehouse interest income 
we earn net interest income on loans funded through borrowings from our warehouse facilities from the time the loan is closed until the loan is sold pursuant to the loan purchase agreement 
each borrowing on a warehouse line relates to a specific loan for which we have already secured a loan sale commitment with an investor 
because of this matched funding  we typically do not incur warehouse interest expense in excess of the warehouse interest income for a particular loan 
related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted  in our financial statements  against interest income 
net warehouse interest income varies based on the period of time between the loan closing and the sale of the loan to the investor  the size of the average balance of the loans held for sale  and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing 
loans typically remain in the warehouse facility for up to days 
loans that we broker for institutional investors and other investors are funded directly by them 
escrow earnings and other interest income 
we earn interest income on property level escrow deposits in our servicing portfolio  generally based on an average day libor plus a spread 
escrow earnings reflect interest income net of interest paid to the borrower  which generally equals a money market rate 
other 
other income is comprised of investment consulting and related services fees  make whole payments  and other miscellaneous revenues related to our mortgage banking operations which are not directly attributable to the origination of a loan 
costs and expenses personnel 
personnel expense includes the cost of employee compensation and benefits  which include fixed and discretionary amounts tied to company and individual performance  severance expense primarily associated with the acquisition  and stock based compensation 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization and depreciation is principally comprised of amortization of our msrs 
the msrs are amortized in proportion to  and over the period that  net servicing income is expected to be received 
we amortize the guaranty obligations evenly over the same period as the associated msrs 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment ratably over their estimated useful lives 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is principally related to the amortization of the mortgage pipeline intangible asset recognized in connection with the acquisition 
we recognize amortization related to the mortgage pipeline intangible asset when a loan included in the mortgage pipeline intangible asset is rate locked or is no longer probable of rate locking 
provision for risk sharing obligations 
the provision for risk sharing obligations is established at the loan level for risk sharing loans when the borrower has defaulted on the loan or we believe it is probable the borrower will default on the loan and a loss has been incurred 
this provision is in addition to the guaranty obligation that is recognized when the loan is sold 
our estimates of value are 
table of contents based on appraisals  broker opinions of value  or net operating income and market capitalization rates  whichever we believe is a better estimate of the net disposition value 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include sub servicing costs  facilities costs  travel and entertainment  marketing costs  professional fees  licenses  dues and subscriptions  corporate insurance and other administrative expenses 
as a result of the completion of the acquisition  we incurred certain costs that are unique to the acquisition  significantly increasing the amount of other operating expenses for the year ended december  income tax expense 
our predecessor entities historically operated as pass through tax entities partnerships  llcs and s corporations 
accordingly  our historical earnings have resulted in only nominal federal and state corporate level expense 
the tax liability has been the obligation of our owners 
upon closing of our initial public offering on december   our tax status changed to a c corporation and our income became subject to both federal and state corporate tax 
as a result of the formation transaction and change in tax status  we recognized net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding deferred tax expense in the fourth quarter of we recognized income tax expense for the days following the formation transaction  and our combined effective federal and state tax rate for its income during those days was 
as of december and  our combined effective federal and state tax rate was and  respectively 
results of operations following is a discussion of our results of operation for the years ended december    and the financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
our business is not typically subject to seasonal trends 
however  our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future  reflecting the interest rate environment  the volume of transactions

congress and other governmental authorities have also suggested that lenders will be required to retain on their balance sheet a portion of the loans that they originate  although no regulation has yet been implemented 
in either scenario  we would require additional liquidity to support the increased collateral requirements 
fannie mae has established benchmark standards for capital adequacy  and reserves the right to terminate the company servicing authority for all or some of the portfolio if at any time it determines that the company financial condition is not adequate to support its obligation under the dus agreement

use of the at risk portfolio provides for comparability of the full risk sharing and modified risk sharing loans because the provision and 
table of contents allowance for risk sharing obligations are based on the at risk balances of the associated loans 
accordingly  we have presented the key statistics as a percentage of the at risk portfolio 
for example  a million loan with dus risk sharing has the same potential risk exposure as a million loan with full dus risk sharing 
accordingly  if the million loan with dus risk sharing was to default  the company would view the overall loss as a percentage of the at risk balance  or million  to ensure comparability between all risk sharing obligations 
as of december   all of the company risk sharing obligations that we have settled have been from full risk sharing loans 
there are loans within our servicing portfolio which are greater than days delinquent  for which no allowance has been recorded 
we do not anticipate recognizing a loss for these loans upon settlement of our risk sharing obligation with fannie mae because our estimate of the value of the underlying collateral is greater than the unpaid principal balance of the associated loan 
fannie mae dus risk sharing obligations are based on a tiered formula 
the risk sharing tiers and amount of the risk sharing obligations we absorb under full risk sharing are provided below 
except as described in the following paragraph  the maximum amount of risk sharing obligations we absorb is of the unpaid principal balance of the loan at the time of default
