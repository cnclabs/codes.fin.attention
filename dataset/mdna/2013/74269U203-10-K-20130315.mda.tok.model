table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our notes to financial statements 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
revenue recognition in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
we adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis for new or materially modified revenue arrangements as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact in the future 
our most common sale involves the integration of software and a hardware appliance  where the hardware and software work together to deliver the essential functionality of the product 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer resulting in the existence of persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  evidenced when product title transfers to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
product revenue consists of revenue from sales of appliances and software licenses 
product sales include a perpetual license to our software that is essential to the functionality of the hardware  and on occasion include licenses to additional software 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
virtually all sales include post contract support pcs services included in support revenue which consist of software updates and customer support 
software updates provide customers access to a constantly growing library of electronic internet traffic identifiers signatures and rights to non specific software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
support includes internet access to technical content  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
receipt of a customer purchase order is the primary method of determining that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery generally occurs when a product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
however  product revenue based on channel partner purchase orders is recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as we have established significant experience with the channel partner s ability to complete the sales process  which requires judgment 
additionally  when we introduce new products for which there is no historical evidence of acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of end user acceptance until such history has been established 
fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer all of the revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
customer orders normally contain multiple items 
the initial product delivery consists of the hardware and software elements and these elements have standalone value to the customer 
through the year ended december   in virtually all of our contracts  the only elements that remained undelivered at the time of product delivery were pcs services 
prior to january   the majority of our transactions were within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
we accordingly recognized revenue for delivered items using the residual method  after allocating revenue to pcs services based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
under the revenue recognition guidance discussed in the first paragraph above  we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on relative selling price using a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or our best estimate of selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
in arrangements that include non essential software software deliverables  revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for the non software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement 
revenue allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated first to the pcs services based on vsoe  and then to the software  using the residual method under the software revenue recognition guidance 

table of contents we determine vsoe for pcs based on the rate charged to customers based upon renewal pricing for pcs 
each contract or purchase order entered into includes a stated rate for pcs 
the renewal rate is generally equal to the stated rate in the original contract 
we have a history of such renewals  the vast majority of which are at the stated renewal rate on a customer by customer basis 
pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
a small portion of service revenue is derived from providing training on products and we use the completed contract method to recognize such revenue 
as our hardware and software products are rarely sold separately  we generally do not have vsoe for these products  and tpe is not available 
we determine the esp for hardware and software deliverables considering internal factors such as discounting and pricing policies and external factors such as market conditions in different geographies and competitive positioning 
in certain contracts  billing terms may be agreed upon based on performance milestones such as the execution of a measurement test  a partial delivery or the completion of a specified service 
payments received before the unconditional acceptance of a specific set of deliverables are recorded as deferred revenue until the conditional acceptance has been waived 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we review our long lived assets including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets  an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulties or delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of an acquired business 
an impairment test involves a comparison of undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
no impairment losses were incurred in the periods presented 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value at a reporting unit level 
we operate in one segment  which is considered to be the sole reporting unit  and therefore  we test our goodwill at the enterprise level 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
as of december   we completed the first step of our annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment of goodwill 
therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces trade receivables to the amount that is ultimately believed to be collectible 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed regularly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessment of a customer s ability to pay 
individual accounts receivable are written off when all collection efforts have been exhausted 

table of contents stock based compensation we apply the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock based on its historical volatility over a period equivalent to the expected term of the option 
we estimate the expected term of stock options using historical exercise data 
we use the exact number of days between the grant and the exercise dates to calculate a weighted average of the holding periods for all awards ie  the average interval between the grant and exercise or post vesting cancellation dates  adjusted as appropriate 
we determine the risk free interest rate for a period equivalent to the expected term of the option by extrapolating from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience 
accounting for income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with asc topic  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets and  accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been provided against net deferred tax assets 
tax expense has taken into account any change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where the realization of various deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  asu 
asu finalizes the requirements of asu that asu deferred  clarifying how to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu is to be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this asu will materially change the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments in this asu generally represent clarification of topic  but also include instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with gaap and ifrs 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and are to be applied prospectively 
early application is not permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income or other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  and is to be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the aggregate consideration of approximately million usd  consists of million in cash and  shares of procera common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as described by item a of regulation s k 
we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provide us with financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the contractual obligations that we were reasonably likely to incur as of december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total year years years years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total we use third party contract manufacturers to assemble and test our hardware products 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure an adequate supply of inventories  our agreements with some of these manufacturers allow them to procure long lead time component inventory based on rolling production forecasts provided by us 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by certain manufacturers in accordance with our forecasts 
in addition  we issue purchase orders to our third party manufacturers that may not be cancelable at any time 
as of december   we had open non cancelable purchase orders amounting to approximately million  primarily with our third party contract manufacturers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales contracts are denominated predominantly in us dollars  swedish krona  british pound  australian dollars and the euro 
we incur operating expenses primarily in us dollars  swedish krona and australian dollars 
therefore  we are subject to fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our revenues  operating results and cash flows  and we have not used derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
however  the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  depending on which foreign currency exchange rates change and the directional change against the us dollar 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling approximately million at december  cash equivalents and short term investments are composed of money market funds  us agency securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit and corporate bonds 
our investment policy requires investments to be of high credit quality  primarily rated a a  with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
all short term investments have an effective maturity of less than one year and are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
because of the short weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio at december   we believe that the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates
