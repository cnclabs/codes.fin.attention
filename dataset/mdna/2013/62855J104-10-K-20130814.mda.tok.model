item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading molecular diagnostic company dedicated to making a difference in patients lives through the discovery and commercialization of transformative tests which assess a person s risk of developing disease  guide treatment decisions and assess risk of disease progression and recurrence 
we believe in improving healthcare for patients by providing physicians with critical information to solve unmet medical needs 
by understanding the underlying genetic basis of disease  we believe that individuals who have a greater risk of developing disease can be identified and physicians may be able to use this information to improve patient outcomes and better manage patient healthcare 
in addition  by understanding the rna expression levels of certain genes  we believe that we can improve patient healthcare by providing information on the aggressiveness of their disease 
further  we believe that the analysis of the expression of groups of proteins may provide a physician with life saving information to guide treatment decisions for their patients with cancer and other major diseases 
our goal is to provide physicians with this critical information that may guide the healthcare management of their patients to prevent disease  diagnose the disease at an earlier stage  determine the most appropriate therapy  or assess the aggressiveness of their disease 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies  including dna  rna and protein analysis  that help us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins may play in the onset and progression of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic tests that are designed to assess an individual s risk for developing disease later in life predictive medicine  identify a patient s likelihood of responding to drug therapy and guide a patient s dosing to ensure optimal treatment personalized medicine  or assess a patient s risk of disease progression and disease recurrence prognostic medicine 
our business strategy for future growth is focused on three key initiatives 
first  we are working to grow and expand our existing products and markets 
second  we are developing our business internationally and have recently established operations in europe 
finally  we intend to launch new transformative products across a diverse set of disease indications  complementing our current businesses in oncology  women s health and urology 
on may   we completed the acquisition of the privately held molecular diagnostic company  rules based medicine  inc of austin  texas  for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
the acquired company has been consolidated into our operations as myriad rbm 
the acquisition expanded our product pipeline into new disease states  including neuroscience disorders  infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases  and added eight new molecular diagnostic test candidates to our current product pipeline 
during the fiscal year ended june   we devoted our resources to supporting and growing our transformative molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic businesses  as well as to the research and development of future molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic candidates 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating segments 
our consolidated revenues primarily consisted of sales of molecular diagnostic tests through our wholly owned myriad genetic laboratories subsidiary and companion diagnostic services through our wholly owned myriad rbm subsidiary 
during the year ended june   we reported net income of million and diluted earnings per share of that included income tax expense of million 
we incurred research and development expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
our research and development expenses include costs incurred in maintaining and improving our nine current molecular diagnostic test offerings and costs incurred for the discovery  development and validation of our pipeline of molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic test candidates 

table of contents our selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with building our molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic businesses domestically and internationally 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  customer service  billing and collection  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase from quarter to quarter and that such increases may be substantial  depending on the number and scope of any new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic launches  our efforts in support of our existing molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services as well as our continued international expansion efforts 
between may and january  we repurchased million of our outstanding common stock 
in february  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase an additional million of our outstanding common stock 
in connection with this latest stock repurchase authorization  we have been authorized to repurchase shares at management s discretion based on market conditions and have repurchased million of our outstanding common stock as of june  under this authorization

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  and income taxes revenue recognition 
revenue includes the sale of molecular diagnostic tests and of our companion diagnostic services 
revenue is recorded at the invoiced amount net of any discounts or allowances and is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the test or service  communication of results  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests  which are recorded net of any discounts or contractual allowances 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge or credit to expense when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations or financial position  however  to date these changes have not been material 
it is possible that we may need to adjust our estimates in future periods 
after a review of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of june  and  we have determined that a hypothetical ten percent increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts would result in additional bad debt expense and an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 

table of contents goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and in the interim by reporting unit if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the events and circumstances that are considered include business climate and market conditions  legal factors  operating performance indicators and competition 
impairment of goodwill is evaluated on a qualitative basis to determine if using a two step process is necessary 
if the qualitative assessment suggests that impairment is more likely than not  a two step impairment analysis is performed 
the first step involves comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the valuation of a reporting unit requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of our business  including such factors as industry performance  market saturation and opportunity  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book value of reporting units to exceed their fair values 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 
if an event occurs that would cause a revision to the estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of the goodwill  the revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on the financial results 
at june   the company has recorded goodwill of million related to the companion diagnostic segment  which we have concluded represents a reporting unit 
we measured the fair value of the companion diagnostic reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches 
the income approach considered management s business plans and projections as the basis for expected cash flows for the next nine years and a residual growth rate thereafter 
we also used a weighted average discount rate of for the analysis 
other significant estimates used in the analysis include the profitability of the respective reporting unit and working capital effects 
the market approach used values for comparable companies and market transactions 
we noted the fair value of the companion diagnostic reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by slightly more than using these assumptions mentioned 
a hypothetical increase in the weighted average discount rate of would decrease the calculated fair value as a percentage of book value for the companion diagnostic reporting unit by 
a hypothetical decrease in the residual growth rate of would decrease the calculated fair value as a percent of book value for the companion diagnostic reporting unit by 
income taxes 
our income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the liability method in accordance with accounting standards codification asc income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  or the expected results from any future tax examinations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future provision for income taxes 
those factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  the results of any future tax examinations  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  past levels of r d spending  acquisitions  changes in our corporate structure  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes all of which may result in periodic revisions to our provision for income taxes 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential uncertain tax positions  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowance we deem necessary to offset deferred tax assets 
if we do not maintain taxable income from operations in future periods  we may increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and record material adjustments to our income tax expense 
our judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determination by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
interest and penalties on income tax items are included as a component of overall income tax expense 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the amendment expands the existing disclosure requirements by requiring entities to present information about significant items reclassified out of aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to provide information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of each component of aoci to net income either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or as a separate disclosure in the notes of the financial statements 
the amendment is effective prospectively for annual or interim reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations years ended june  and revenue is comprised of sales of our molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services 
total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
this increase in revenue is primarily due to increased molecular diagnostic testing volume for our bracanalysis  colaris and colaris ap  a significant increase in bart testing volume as a result of revised medical guidelines  and a significant increase in companion diagnostic services due to increased research collaborations  as disclosed in the table below 
sales of our bracanalysis test accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
we believe that our increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our molecular diagnostic tests by the medical community and increased patient testing volumes 
however  there can be no assurance that our revenue will continue to increase or remain at current levels or that we will be successful in expanding the sale of our tests outside the united states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our written investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of five years or less  with a maximum average maturity of three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
although our investment policy guidelines are intended to ensure the preservation of principal  current market conditions have resulted in high levels of uncertainty 
our ability to trade or redeem the marketable investment securities in which we invest  including certain corporate bonds  has become difficult 
valuation and pricing of these securities has also become variable and subject to uncertainty 
as of june  we have net unrealized losses of  in our investment portfolio 
for the year ended june  we have experienced fluctuations in our portfolio value primarily from our investments in bonds of various municipalities 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks
