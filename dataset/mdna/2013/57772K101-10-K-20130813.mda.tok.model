a copy of this annual report is available without charge upon written request to investor relations  maxim integrated products  inc  rio robles  san jose  california the mixed signal analog integrated circuit market all electronic signals generally fall into one of two categories  linear or digital 
linear or analog signals represent real world phenomena  such as temperature  pressure  sound  or speed  and are continuously variable over a wide range of values 
digital signals represent the ones and zeros of binary arithmetic and are either on or off 
three general classes of semiconductor products arise from this distinction between linear and digital signals digital devices  such as memories and microprocessors that operate primarily in the digital domain  linear devices  such as amplifiers  references  analog multiplexers and switches that operate primarily in the analog domain  and mixed signal devices such as data converter devices that combine linear and digital functions on the same integrated circuit and interface between the analog and digital domains 
our strategy has been to target both the linear and mixed signal markets  often collectively referred to as the analog market 
however  some of our products are exclusively or principally digital 
while our focus continues to be on the linear and mixed signal market  our capabilities in the digital domain enable development of new mixed signal and other products with highly sophisticated digital characteristics 
we operate in one reportable segment the design  development  marketing and manufacturing of a broad range of linear and mixed signal integrated circuits 
our linear and mixed signal products serve four major end markets 
these major end markets and their corresponding market are noted in the table below major end market market communications basestations network datacom telecom other communications computing data storage financial terminals notebook computers server desktop computers peripherals other computing consumer cell phones digital cameras handheld computers home entertainment appliances other consumer industrial automatic test equipment automotive control automation electronic instrumentation medical military aerospace security utility other meters other industrial product quality based on industry standard requirements  we conduct reliability stress testing on the products we manufacture and sell 
through this testing  we can detect and accelerate the presence of defects that may arise over the life of a product 
we employ a system addressing quality and reliability of our products from initial design through wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and final shipment 
we have received iso  ts and iso certifications for all wafer fabrication  assembly  final test and shipping facilities 
manufacturing we utilize our own wafer fabrication facilities as well as third party foundries for the production of our wafers 
the majority of processed wafers are subject to parametric and functional testing at our facilities 
the broad range of products demanded by the analog integrated circuit market requires multiple manufacturing process technologies 
as a result  many different process technologies are currently used for wafer fabrication of our products 
historically  wafer fabrication of analog integrated circuits has not required state of the art processing equipment  although newer processes do utilize and require such state of the art facilities and equipment 
in addition  hybrid and module products are manufactured using a complex multi chip technology featuring thin film  laser trimmed resistors and other active or passive components 
we are expanding our internal and external manufacturing and test capacity to meet our future technology requirements 
during fiscal years  and  a large portion of our own wafer production occurred at one of our three owned wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations facility location fiscal year acquired beaverton  oregon san jose  california san antonio  texas in fiscal year  we entered into a supply agreement with seiko epson corporation epson 
in fiscal year  we entered into a supply agreement with powerchip technology corporation powerchip and maxchip electronics corp 
maxchip to provide mm and mm wafer capacity  respectively 
under these agreements  partner foundries epson  powerchip and maxchip have manufactured some of our mixed signal semiconductor products 
these products are manufactured under rights and licenses using our proprietary technology at epson fabrication facility located in sakata  japan and at powerchip and maxchip fabrication facilities in hsinchu  taiwan 
in fiscal years  and  the products manufactured by our partner foundries represented  and  respectively  of our total wafer production 
once wafer manufacturing has been completed  wafers may be sorted in order to determine which integrated circuits on each wafer are functional and which are defective 
we currently perform the majority of wafer sorting  final testing and shipping activities at two facilities located in cavite  the philippines and chonburi province  thailand  although we also utilize independent subcontractors for some wafer sorting 
where required  our wafer bump manufacturing facility located in dallas  texas is used to process wafers for products that utilize chip scale packaging csp or wafer level packaging wlp 
csp or wlp enables integrated circuits to be attached directly to a printed circuit board without the use of a traditional plastic package 
in addition  we utilize independent subcontractors to perform wafer bump manufacturing to the extent we do not have the internal capacity or capabilities to perform such services 
with the introduction of mm wafers into our manufacturing network  we have enabled subcontractors located in taiwan to perform wafer bumping and testing of these wafers 
integrated circuit assembly is performed by foreign assembly subcontractors  located in china  japan  malaysia  the philippines  taiwan  thailand  singapore and south korea  where wafers are separated into individual integrated circuits and assembled into a variety of packages 
after assembly has been completed  the majority of the assembled product is shipped back to our facilities located in cavite  the philippines or chonburi province  thailand where the packaged integrated circuits undergo final testing and preparation for customer shipment 
in addition  we utilize independent subcontractors to perform final testing 
we currently perform substantially all of our module assembly operations in our facility in batangas  the philippines 
our philippines facility also performs wafer singulation and tape and reel of bumped csp or wlp wafers 
our finished products ship directly from either cavite  the philippines or chonburi province  thailand to customers worldwide or to other company locations for sale to end customers or distributors 
customers  sales and marketing we market our products worldwide through a direct sales and applications organization and through our own and other unaffiliated distribution channels to a broad range of customers in diverse industries 
our products typically require a sophisticated technical sales and marketing effort 
our sales organization is divided into domestic and international regions 
distributors and direct customers generally buy on an individual purchase order basis  rather than pursuant to long term agreements 
certain distributors have agreements with us which allow for certain sales price rebates  price protection on certain inventory if we lower the price of our products 
certain distributor agreements also generally permit distributors to exchange a portion of certain purchases on a periodic basis 
as is customary in the semiconductor industry  our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products 
sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates or price protection 
the agreements generally permit distributors to exchange a portion of their purchases on a periodic basis 
see critical accounting policies in part ii  item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  which contains information regarding our revenue recognition policy 
we derived approximately of our fiscal year revenue from sales made through distributors 
our primary distributor is avnet electronics which accounted for  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
avnet  like our other distributors  is not an end customer  but rather serves as a channel of sale to many end users of the company products 
samsung  our largest single customer  accounted for approximately  and of net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
no single product accounted for more than of net revenues in fiscal years  and based on customers ship to locations  international sales accounted for approximately  and of net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note  segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report 
seasonality our revenue is generally influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by customer demand patterns and new product introductions 
however  an increasing number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronic products  which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand  and tend to have stronger sales in the middle of the calendar year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons 
foreign operations we conduct business in numerous countries outside of the united states us 
our international business is subject to numerous risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  import and export controls  and other laws  policies and regulations of foreign governments 
backlog at june  and june   our current quarter backlog was approximately million and million  respectively 
we include in backlog orders with customer request dates within the next three months 
as is customary in the semiconductor industry  these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers 
in addition  backlog includes orders from domestic distributors for which revenues are not recognized until the products are sold by the distributors 
accordingly  we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure of future revenues 
all backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future us distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments 
research and development we believe that research and development is critical to our future success 
objectives for the research and development function include new product definition and development of differentiated products  design of products with performance differentiation that achieve high manufacturing yield and reliability  development of  and access to  manufacturing processes and advanced packaging  development of hardware and software to support the acceptance and design in of our products in the end customer system  and development of high integration products across multiple end markets 
our research and development plans require engineering talent and tools for process technologies  test development  packaging development  product definition  electronic design automation eda  circuit design  software development and applications support 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see research and development under item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for more information 
competition the mixed signal analog integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive  and virtually all major semiconductor companies presently compete with  or conceivably could compete with  some portion of our business 
we believe the principal elements of competition include technical innovation  service and support  time to market  differentiated product performance and features  quality and reliability  product pricing and delivery capabilities  customized design and applications  business relationship with customers  experience  skill and productivity of employees and management  and manufacturing competence and inventory management 
our principal competitors include  but are not limited to  analog devices  inc  intersil corporation  linear technology corporation  nxp semiconductors nv  semtech corporation and texas instruments inc in addition  we compete with digital chipset providers  including broadcom corporation  samsung system lsi and qualcomm inc we expect increased competition in the future from other emerging and established companies 
patents  licenses  and other intellectual property rights we rely upon both know how and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented  though we may elect  in certain cases  not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection  such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret  is considered by us to be more advantageous 
in addition  we have registered certain of our mask sets under the semiconductor chip protection act of  as amended 
we hold a number of patents worldwide with expiration dates ranging from to we have also registered several of our trademarks and copyrights with the us patent and trademark office and in foreign jurisdictions 
employees as of june   we employed  persons 
environmental regulations our compliance with foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive or financial position 
executive officers for information regarding our current executive officers  see part iii  item of this annual report 
item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on a few large customers and market segments for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of which could materially affect our revenues and results of operations we depend on a few large customers and market segments for a substantial portion of our net revenues 
samsung  our largest single customer  accounted for approximately  and of net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the delay  significant reduction in  or loss of  orders from these large customers or market segments including curtailments of purchases due to a change in the design  manufacturing or sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments or demands of price concessions from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
cyclicality in the semiconductor industry may adversely affect our results of operations historically  the semiconductor industry has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in demand for products and services 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if demand for our products and services decreases or if we are unable to meet an increase in demand without significantly increasing the lead time for the delivery of our products and services 
incorrect forecasts  reductions  cancellations or delays in orders for our products and volatility in customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations as is customary in the semiconductor industry  customer orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to the customers 
some customers place orders that require us to manufacture products and have them available for shipment  even though the customer may be unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even any  of the products 
in other cases  we manufacture products based on forecasts of customer demands 
as a result  we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders  potentially leading to an initial inflation of backlog followed by a sharp reduction 
in addition  backlog includes orders from domestic distributors for which revenues are not recognized until the ordered products are sold by the distributors 
because of the possibility of order cancellation  backlog should not be used as a measure of future revenues 
furthermore  canceled or unrealized orders  especially for products meeting unique customer requirements  may also result in an inventory of unsaleable products  causing potential inventory write offs  some of which could be substantial 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions the global economic environment could subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us  or delay paying us  for previously purchased products 
accordingly  reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase 
in addition  weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties 
this would further increase our credit risk exposure and potentially cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 
if economic or market conditions deteriorate globally  in the united states or in other key markets  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our financial results may be adversely affected by increased tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates  including  but not limited to the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  changes in our global structure that involve an increased investment in technology outside of the united states to better align asset ownership and business functions with revenues and profits  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  and in particular  the outcome of the pending internal revenue service audit of our tax returns for fiscal  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions  changes in available tax credits  changes in share based compensation  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws  changes in generally accepted accounting principles  and the repatriation of non us earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes 
we are subject to taxation in various countries and jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine tax liabilities on a worldwide basis 
any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
political conditions could materially affect our revenues and results of operations we are subject to the political and legal risks inherent in international operations 
exposure to political instabilities  different business policies and varying legal standards could impact economic activity  which in turn could lead to a contraction of customer demand or a disruption in our operations 
we have been impacted by these problems in the past  but none have materially affected our results of operations 
problems in the future or not yet materialized consequences of past problems could affect deliveries of our products to our customers  possibly resulting in substantially delayed or lost sales and or increased expenses that cannot be passed on to customers 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which could adversely impact our common stock price we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results have in the past been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors  some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following fluctuations in demand for our products and services  loss of a significant customer or significant customers electing to purchase from another supplier  reduced visibility into our customers spending plans and associated revenue  the level of price and competition in our product markets  our pricing practices  including our use of available information to maximize pricing potential  the impact of the uncertain economic and credit environment on our customers  channel partners  and suppliers  including their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures  the overall movement toward industry consolidations among our customers and competitors  below industry average growth of the non consumer segments of our business  announcements and introductions of new products by our competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  our ability to meet increases in customer orders in a timely manner  striking an appropriate balance between short term execution and long term innovation  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products and enhancements and market acceptance of such new products and enhancements  and our levels of operating expenses 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology companies generally  including those in the semiconductor industry  have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results  the market price of our common stock may decline 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at a price equal to or higher than the price you paid for them 
due to the nature of our compensation programs  many of our executive officers sell shares of our common stock each quarter or otherwise periodically  including pursuant to trading plans established under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
regardless of the reasons for such sales  analysts and investors could view such actions in a negative light and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected as a result of such periodic sales 
our independent distributors and sales representatives may terminate their relationship with us or fail to make payments on outstanding accounts receivable to us  which would adversely affect our financial results a portion of our sales is realized through independent electronics distributors that are not under our direct control 
these independent sales organizations generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us 
in fiscal  of our revenues were generated from distributors  and of our revenues were generated from avnet  our primary world wide distributor 
we require certain foreign distributors to provide a letter of credit to us in an amount up to the credit limit set for accounts receivable from such foreign distributors 
the letter of credit provides for collection on accounts receivable from the foreign distributor should the foreign distributor default on their accounts receivable to us 
where credit limits have been established above the amount of the letter of credit  we are exposed for the difference 
we do not require letters of credit from any of our domestic distributors and are not contractually protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors 
the inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
termination of a significant distributor  whether at our or the distributor initiative  could be disruptive and harmful to our current business 
our products may fail to meet new industry standards or requirements and the efforts to meet such industry standards or requirements could be costly many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial results 
our critical information systems  necessary for the operation of our business  are subject to interruptions and failures we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business 
these information systems include telecommunications  the internet  our corporate intranet  various computer hardware and software applications  network communications and e mail 
these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers or third parties 
these information systems are subject to attacks  including attacks that may result in theft of our intellectual property  failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses  destructive or inadequate code  power failures and physical damage to computers  hard drives  communication lines and networking equipment 
to the extent that these information systems are under our control  we have implemented security procedures  such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes  to address the outlined risks  however  security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could adversely impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 
we may encounter difficulties in the implementation of a new manufacturing execution system and global execution system  which may adversely affect our operations and financial reporting we are in the process of implementing a new manufacturing execution system mes in our testing facilities that is scheduled to be completed in fiscal year as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the quality and productivity of our operations 
in addition  we are in process of implementing a global execution system ges as part of our efforts to integrate inventory movement with our financial reporting system 
any difficulties in the implementation or operation of the mes or ges could increase the cost to test our products or disrupt the testing of our products 
such developments could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial reporting 
our manufacturing operations may be interrupted or suffer yield problems given the nature of our products  it would be time consuming  difficult  and costly to arrange for new manufacturing facilities to supply such products 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or a third party foundry  due to damages resulting from fire  natural disaster  unavailability of electric power  labor unrest or other causes  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the manufacture and design of integrated circuits is highly complex 
we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  equipment malfunctioning  construction delays  upgrading or expanding existing facilities  changing our process technologies  or new technology qualification delays  particularly in our internal fabrication facilities  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues or increases in fixed costs 
to the extent we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or we experience delays in wafer fabrication  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  operating expenses related to increases in production capacity may adversely affect our operating results if revenues do not increase proportionately 
our operating results may be adversely affected by increased competition or our inability to timely develop new products through our research and development efforts the marketplace for our products in constantly changing and we are required to make substantial ongoing investments in our research and development 
we experience intense competition from a number of companies  some of which have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  and marketing resources than us  as well as greater technical resources and proprietary intellectual property rights than us 
the principal elements of competition include product performance  functional value  quality and reliability  technical service and support  price  diversity of product line  sale of multiple chips for a price as part of a complete system solution and delivery capabilities 
we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors  although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to companies with broader product lines  greater technical service and support capabilities and larger research and development budgets 
we may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors and our operating results may be adversely affected by increased competition or our inability to timely develop new products to meet the needs of our customers 
our dependence on subcontractors for assembly  test  freight  wafer fabrication and logistic services and certain manufacturing services may cause delays beyond our control in delivering products to our customers we rely on subcontractors located in various parts of the world for assembly and csp packaging services  freight and logistic services  wafer fabrication and sorting and testing services 
none of the subcontractors we currently use are affiliated with us 
reliability problems experienced by our subcontractors or the inability to promptly replace any subcontractor could cause serious problems in delivery and quality resulting in potential product liability to us 
such problems could impair our ability to meet our revenue plan in the fiscal year period impacted by the disruption 
failure to meet the revenue plan may materially adversely impact our results of operations 
any disruptions in our sort  assembly  test  freight and logistic operations or in the operations of our subcontractors  including  but not limited to  the inability or unwillingness of any of our subcontractors to produce or timely deliver adequate supplies of processed wafers  integrated circuit packages or tested products conforming to our quality standards  or other required products or services could damage our reputation  relationships and goodwill with customers 
furthermore  finding alternate sources of supply or initiating internal wafer processing for these products may not be economically feasible 
shortage of raw materials or supply disruption of such raw materials could harm our business the semiconductor industry has experienced a large expansion of fabrication capacity and production worldwide over time 
as a result of increasing demand from semiconductor  solar and other manufacturers  availability of certain basic materials and supplies  and of subcontract services  has been limited from time to time over the past several years  and could come into short supply again if overall industry demand exceeds the supply of these materials and services in the future 
we purchase materials and supplies from many suppliers  some of which are sole sourced 
if the availability of these materials and supplies is interrupted  we may not be able to find suitable replacements 
in addition  from time to time natural disasters can lead to a shortage of some materials due to disruption of the manufacturer production 
we continually strive to maintain availability of all required materials  supplies and subcontract services 
however  we do not have long term agreements providing for all of these materials  supplies and services  and shortages could occur as a result of capacity limitations or production constraints on suppliers that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our production requirements 
environmental  safety and health laws and regulations could force us to expend significant capital and incur substantial costs various foreign and domestic federal  state  and local government agencies impose a variety of environmental  safety and health laws and regulations on the storage  handling  use  discharge and disposal of certain chemicals  gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
historically  compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive or financial position 
there can be no assurance  however  that interpretation and enforcement of current or future environmental  safety and health laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us 
any failure by us to adequately control the storage  handling  use  discharge or disposal of regulated substances could result in fines  suspension of production  alteration of wafer fabrication processes and legal liability  which may materially adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
employee health benefit costs may negatively impact our profitability with a large number of employees participating in our health benefit plans  our expenses relating to employee health benefits are substantial 
in past years  we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs  largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control  including  in particular  ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation 
while we have attempted to control these costs in recent years  there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in controlling such costs in the future 
continued increasing health care costs  as well as changes in laws  regulations and assumptions used to calculate health and benefit expenses  may adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the patient protection and affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by congress and state legislatures may increase our employee healthcare related costs 
while the most significant costs of the recent healthcare legislation enacted will not occur until after due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time  changes to our healthcare costs structure could negatively impact our profitability 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may impact our ability to compete effectively we rely upon know how  trade secrets  and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries generally do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states  and we may encounter problems in protecting our proprietary rights in those foreign countries 
other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes  and we could be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products  if such patents are valid and other design and manufacturing solutions are not available 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses  if required  upon commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may suffer losses and business interruption if our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others in the past  it has been common in the semiconductor industry for patent holders to offer licenses on reasonable terms and rates 
although the practice of offering licenses appears to be generally continuing  in some situations  typically where the patent directly relates to a specific product or family of products  patent holders have refused to grant licenses 
in any of those cases  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any necessary license on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or that we would be able to re engineer our products or processes in a cost effective manner to avoid infringement 
any litigation in such a situation could involve an injunction to prevent the sales of a material portion of our products  the reduction or elimination of the value of related inventories and the assessment of a substantial monetary award for damages related to past sales  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience losses related to intellectual property indemnity claims we provide intellectual property indemnification for certain customers  distributors  suppliers and subcontractors for attorney fees and damages and costs awarded against these parties in certain circumstances in which our products are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights  including patents  registered trademarks and copyrights 
in certain cases  there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
to date  we have not been required to pay significant amounts for intellectual property indemnification claims 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not have significant financial exposure under those intellectual property indemnification obligations in the future 
business interruptions from natural disasters could harm our ability to produce products we operate our business in worldwide locations 
some of our facilities and those of our subcontractors are located in geologically unstable areas of the world and are susceptible to damage from natural disasters 
in the event of a natural disaster  we may suffer a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial condition  operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected in the event of a catastrophic loss for which we are self insured we are primarily self insured with respect to many of our commercial risks and exposures 
based on management assessment and judgment  we have determined that it is generally more cost effective to self insure these risks 
the risks and exposures we self insure include  but are not limited to  fire  property and casualty  natural disasters  product defects  political risk  general liability  theft  counterfeits  patent infringement  certain employment practice matters and medical benefits for many of our us employees 
should there be catastrophic loss from events such as fires  explosions or earthquakes or other natural disasters  among many other risks  or adverse court or similar decisions in any area in which we are self insured  our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
limitations in manufacturing capacity or delays in lead time for delivery of products could adversely affect our future growth opportunities and results of operations limitations in manufacturing capacity and other supply constraints could impede our ability to grow revenues and meet increased customer demands for our products 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to meet such increase in demand for our products without significantly increasing the lead time required for our delivery of such products 
any significant increase in the lead time for delivery of products may negatively affect our customer relationships  reputation as a dependable supplier of products and ability to obtain future design wins  while potentially increasing order cancellations  aged  unsaleable or otherwise unrealized backlog  and the likelihood of our breach of supply agreement terms 
any of the foregoing factors could negatively affect our future revenue growth and results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by warranty claims and product liability we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability suits in connection with reliability problems or other product defects that may affect our customers 
our products are used by a variety of industries  including the transportation and medical industries 
failure of our products to perform to specifications  or other product defects  could lead to substantial damage to both the end product in which our device has been placed and to the user of such end product 
although we take measures to protect against product defects  if a product liability claim is brought against us  the cost of defending the claim could be significant and any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we manufacture and sell products into many global jurisdictions where our efforts to contractually limit liability for certain damages  including consequential  indirect and non proximately caused damages  may not be enforceable or may be found by a court to not apply in a particular situation 
likewise  as we continue to partner with certain customers we may be required to accept increasing exposure for liability  including product liability 
we believe these relationships with key customers will continue to increase 
while we attempt to structure our customer relationships to reduce such exposures  it is not always possible to limit or eliminate such liability 
should we choose to not enter into such relationships or limit the number of such relationships due to our inability to negotiate acceptable limits on liability  our revenues and financial operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may be liable for additional production costs and lost revenues to certain customers with whom we have entered into customer supply agreements if we are unable to meet certain product quantity and quality requirements we enter into contracts with certain customers whereby we commit to supply quantities of specified parts at a predetermined scheduled delivery date 
the number of such arrangements continues to increase as this practice becomes more commonplace 
should we be unable to supply the customer with the specific part at the quantity and product quality desired and on the scheduled delivery date  the customer may incur additional production costs 
in addition  the customer may lose revenues due to a delay in receiving the parts necessary to have the end product ready for sale to its customers or due to product quality issues 
under certain customer supply agreements  we may be liable for direct additional production costs or lost revenues 
if products are not shipped on time or are quality deficient  we may be liable for penalties and resulting damages 
such liability  should it arise  and or our inability to meet these commitments to our customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could damage our relationships  reputation and goodwill with the affected customers 
we may pursue acquisitions and investments that could harm our operating results and may disrupt our business impairment of goodwill poses a financial risk for failed acquisitions 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments  alliances and acquisitions we consider necessary or desirable to gain access to key technologies that we believe will complement our existing technical capability and support our business model objectives 
acquisitions  alliances and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future financial performance 
if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful  we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
we may also need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
any of the foregoing  and other  factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
in addition  because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
if we fail to enter into future vendor managed inventory arrangements or fail to supply the specific product or quantity under such arrangements  the results of our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted we enter into arrangements with certain original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing services ems partners to consign quantities of certain products within close proximity of the oems and ems partners manufacturing location 
the inventory is physically segregated at these locations and we retain title and risk of loss related to this inventory until such time as the oem or ems partner pulls the inventory for use in its manufacturing process 
once the inventory is pulled by the oem or ems partner  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  at which point we relieve inventory and recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold 
the specific quantities to be consigned are based on a forecast provided by the oem or ems partner 
generally  the arrangements with the oems and ems partners provide for transfer of title and risk of loss once product has been consigned for a certain length of time 
we believe these arrangements will continue to grow in terms of number of customers and products and will increase in proportion to consolidated net revenues 
should we be unable or unwilling to enter into such agreements as requested by oems or ems partners  our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted 
in addition  should we be unable to supply the specific product in the quantity needed by the oem or ems partner as reflected in their forecast  we may be liable for damages  including  but not limited to  lost revenues and increased production costs which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
should we supply product in excess of the oem or ems partners actual usage  any inventory not consumed may become excess or obsolete  which would result in an inventory write off that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to service our debt obligations  including million of senior unsecured notes  requires sufficient cash flow from our future operations in march  the company issued million of senior unsecured notes due interest is payable semi annually on march and september the debt indenture includes covenants that limit the company ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions  which could limit the company ability to secure debt funding in the future 
in circumstances involving a change of control of the company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the company notes  the company would be required to make an offer to repurchase these notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the company ability to repurchase the notes in such events may be limited by the company then available financial resources or by the terms of other agreements to which the company is a party 
although the company currently has the funds necessary to retire this debt  funds might not be available to repay the notes when they become due in the future 
if the company fails to pay interest when due  fails to repay the notes when due or materially breaches other loan covenants  it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the notes which  in turn  may also constitute an event of default under other obligations of the company 
any event of default under the indenture or other obligations of the company and any additional obligations and restrictions imposed as a result thereof could negatively impact our financial results 
we may be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or changes in trade policies we conduct our manufacturing and other operations in various worldwide locations 
a portion of our operating costs and expenses at foreign locations are paid in local currencies 
many of the materials used in our products and much of the manufacturing process for our products are supplied by foreign companies or by our foreign operations  such as our test operations in the philippines and thailand 
approximately  and of our net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  were from international sales 
accordingly  both manufacturing and sales of our products may be adversely affected by political or economic conditions abroad 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation are routinely proposed in the united states and certain foreign countries 
a change in current tariff structures or other trade policies could adversely affect our foreign manufacturing or marketing strategies 
currency exchange fluctuations could also decrease revenue and increase our operating costs  the cost of components manufactured abroad  and the cost of our products to foreign customers  or decrease the costs of products produced by our foreign competitors 
we are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations  including us customs and export regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act among other laws and regulations  we are subject to us customs and export regulations  including us international traffic and arms regulations and similar laws  which collectively control import  export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business  and the foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws  which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business 
while our company policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement  including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other activities of the company  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our chief executive officer  our other executive officers  and key management and technical personnel  particularly our experienced engineers and business unit managers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or several of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our company 
in addition  we could be materially adversely affected if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increases significantly or we are unsuccessful in attracting  motivating and retaining qualified personnel 
should we lose one or more engineers who are key to a project completion during the course of a particular project  the completion of such project may be delayed which could negatively affect customer relationships and goodwill and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti takeover provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a hostile change in control of our company our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions applicable to such shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
any such issuance might discourage  delay or prevent a hostile change in control of our company 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to utilize estimates which may lead to volatility in reported earnings and balances the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
such estimates relate to the useful lives and fair value of fixed assets  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  reserves relating to uncertain tax positions  allowances for doubtful accounts  customer returns and allowances  inventory valuation  reserves relating to litigation matters  assumptions about the fair value of reporting units  goodwill and other intangibles impairment  accrued liabilities and reserves and assumptions related to the calculation of stock based compensation 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs regarding what could occur in the future  given available information 
actual results may differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
additionally  new accounting pronouncements and guidance have been promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb that require companies to regularly attempt to determine or estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and adjust those amounts to reflect the revised estimates 
recent pronouncements have broadened this trend to direct how to estimate and account for fair value measurements as well as give companies the option to apply fair value measurements more broadly to many financial assets and liabilities
