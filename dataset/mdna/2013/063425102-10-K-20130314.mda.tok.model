item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included in part ii item of this report 
average balances  including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances 
forward looking statements the disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in part i captioned forward looking statements and item a captioned risk factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report 
executive summary record annual earnings for totaled million  up  from million in the same period a year ago 
diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  totaled  up  from in the same period of our overall strong performance demonstrates the solid relationships we have built with our customers while also maintaining our high credit quality standards 
we proactively manage problem credit relationships which have resulted in a number of successful resolutions of purchased credit impaired loans 
total loans increased million  or to billion at december  when compared to billion at december  this growth was driven by strong performance in marin million  napa million  santa rosa million and san francisco million markets 
we have seen construction loans decline as our primary focus continues to be business lending 
we are adding lenders with wine industry experience and believe we are positioned for future growth in the wine related business in napa and sonoma counties 
credit quality remains solid with net charge offs in totaling million compared to million in the prior year 
charge offs included million in loans from the acquisition 
the allowance for loan losses totaled of loans at december   compared to at december  the decline from the prior year primarily relates to current year charge offs of specific reserves established in despite the increase in non accrual loans  the newly identified problem loans do not have significant credit loss exposure due to their well secured nature 
in addition  we have experienced a shift in the mix of loans toward those having a lower loss reserve factor and fewer loans graded substandard 
the provision for loan losses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to fewer newly identified problem loans that have significant loss exposure 
the provision for loan losses included million related to the acquired loan portfolio  which did not recur in non accruing loans totaled million  or of bancorp total loan portfolio at december   compared to million  or a year ago 
the increase in is primarily related to two problem borrowing relationships 
we believe these loans are adequately collateralized and expect gradual pay downs in deposits totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase primarily reflects increases of million in transaction accounts  million in non interest bearing accounts  million in savings accounts and million in money market accounts  partially offset by decreases of million in cdars time accounts and million in other time accounts 
non interest bearing deposits totaled of total deposits at december  in a conscious effort to deploy excess liquidity  we grew our investment securities portfolio to million at december   an increase of million or  from million at december  the total risk based capital ratio for bancorp grew to  up from at december   and continues to be well above industry requirements for a well capitalized institution 
page the continued low interest rate environment has resulted in net interest margin compression 
net interest income totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was in  compared to in and in the decreases from prior years reflect a lower level of accretion on purchased loans  rate concessions and downward repricing on existing loans  and lower yields on new loans and securities 
these decreases are partially offset by a reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as the prior year reflects a thousand prepayment penalty on a federal home loan bank fhlb advance in september furthermore  the current year was positively affected by the maturity of another fhlb advance in january  as well as the downward repricing on deposits 
going forward  we expect to see continued pressure on the margin  as the low interest rate environment is expected to continue 
as the higher yielding loans repay and investment securities are called or mature  we expect them to continue to be replaced at the lower market rates due to increased competition for quality loans 
in this historically low interest rate environment  our cost of deposits totaled basis points in the year ended december   which doesn t leave much room for additional downward pricing of deposits to manage pressure on the net interest margin 
nonetheless  we continue to focus on growing our loan volume  which will favorably impact our net interest margin 
we expect loan fundings to continue in based on our strong loan pipeline and our planned hiring of lenders 
if interest rates increase  we anticipate that net interest income will rise 
additionally  it may take several upward market rate movements for the variable rate loans at floors to move above the floor rates 
please see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for more information about the affect of interest rate increases on our net interest income 
non interest income totaled million in the year ended compared to million in the same period of the year to date increase of thousand  or from the prior year primarily reflects higher merchant card interchange income and service charges on deposit accounts 
non interest expense totaled million and million in and  respectively  representing a thousand or increase 
the year to date increase in compared to the same period a year ago primarily reflects higher personnel costs associated with merit increases  and to a lesser extent  new hires in the lending and deposit services areas  partially offset by lower acquisition related expenses and lower data processing expenses due to a re negotiated contract 
expense control continues to be a high priority and our efficiency ratio was a solid in and in page critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has determined the following five accounting policies to be critical allowance for loan losses  acquired loans  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  accounting for income taxes and fair value measurements 
allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates of loan losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
in periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance balance  management considers our past loan loss experience by type of credit  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors 
we formally assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of loans based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are reviewed as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower and or when facts demonstrate heightened risk of default 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by outside consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by periodic examination by various bank regulatory agencies 
management monitors delinquent loans continuously and identifies problem loans to be evaluated individually for impairment testing 
for loans that are deemed impaired  formal impairment measurement is performed at least quarterly on a loan by loan basis 
our method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth and economic factors 
allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits 
loss estimation factors for loan categories are based on analysis of local economic factors applicable to each loan category  including consideration of our charge off history 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management best estimate of the probable impact on the loan portfolio as a whole 
for our methodology on estimating the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans  refer to the section acquired loans below 
acquired loans acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair values at acquisition date in accordance with asc business combinations  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded for acquired loans as of the acquisition date 
the process of estimating fair values of the acquired loans  including the estimate of losses that are expected to be incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the loans at acquisition date and the ongoing updates to management expectation of future cash flows  requires significant subjective judgments and assumptions  particularly considering the current economic environment 
the economic environment and the lack of market liquidity and transparency are factors that have influenced  and may continue to affect  these assumptions and estimates 
we estimated the fair value of acquired loans at the acquisition date based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral  risk classification  fixed or variable interest rate  term of loan and whether or not the loan was amortizing  and current discount rates 
loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques 
the estimate of expected cash flows incorporates our best estimate of current key assumptions  such as property values  default rates  loss severity and prepayment speeds 
the discount rates used for loans were based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans  where available  and include adjustments for liquidity concerns 
page to the extent comparable market rates are not readily available  a discount rate was derived based on the assumptions of market participants cost of funds  servicing costs and return requirements for comparable risk assets 
in either case  the discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses  as that has been considered in estimating the cash flows 
the initial estimate of cash flows to be collected was derived from assumptions such as default rates  loss severities and prepayment speeds 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we purchased certain loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration subsequent to their origination and for which it was probable  at acquisition  that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments 
management has applied significant subjective judgment in determining which loans are pci loans 
evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include data such as past due and nonaccrual status  risk grades and recent loan to value percentages 
revolving credit agreements eg home equity lines of credit and revolving commercial loans  where the borrower had revolving privileges at acquisition date  are not considered pci loans because the timing and amount of cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated 
the accounting guidance for pci loans provides that the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date ie  the accretable yield should be accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining term of the loan  provided that the timing and amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable 
the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition  considering the impact of prepayments  is referred to as the nonaccretable difference and is not recorded 
the initial estimate of cash flows expected to be collected is updated each quarter and requires the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates similar to the initial estimate of fair value 
given the current economic environment  we apply judgment to develop our estimate of cash flows for pci loans given the impact of real estate value changes  changing probability of default  loss severities and prepayment speeds 
for purposes of accounting for the pci loans purchased in the acquisition  we elected not to apply the pooling method but to account for these loans individually 
disposals of loans  which may include sales of loans to third parties  receipt of payments in full by the borrower  or foreclosure of the collateral  result in removal of the loan from the pci loan portfolio at its carrying amount 
if we have probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected on pci loans  we first reverse any previously established allowance for loan loss and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans 
the impact of changes in variable interest rates is recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income 
all pci loans that were classified as nonperforming loans prior to acquisition were no longer classified as nonperforming because  at acquisition  we believed that we would fully collect the new carrying value of these loans 
subsequent to acquisition  specific allowances are allocated to pci loans that have experienced credit deterioration through an increase to the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of cash flows expected to be collected and  accordingly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are particularly sensitive to changes in loan credit quality 
when there is doubt as to the timing and amount of future cash flows to be collected  pci loans are classified as non accrual loans 
it is important to note that judgment is required to classify pci loans as performing or non accrual  and is dependent on having a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
for acquired loans not considered pci loans  we elect to recognize the entire fair value discount accretion based on the acquired loan contractual cash flows using an effective interest rate method for term loans  and on a straight line basis to interest income for revolving lines  as the timing and amount of cash flows under revolving lines are not predictable 
subsequent to acquisition  if the probable and estimable losses for non pci loans exceed the amount of the remaining unaccreted discount  the excess is established as an allowance for loan losses 
for further information regarding our acquired loans  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
page other than temporary impairment of investment securities at each financial statement date  we assess whether declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their costs are deemed to be other than temporary 
we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  the remaining payment terms of the instrument and economic factors that are relevant to the collectability of the instrument  such as current prepayment speeds  the current financial condition of the issuer s  industry analyst reports  credit ratings  credit default rates  interest rate trends and the value of any underlying collateral 
credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to earnings and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
non credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes  and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
the other than temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income for debt securities classified as held to maturity is accreted from other comprehensive income to the amortized cost of the debt security over the remaining life of the debt security in a prospective manner on the basis of the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
accounting for income taxes income taxes reported in the financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach 
we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business 
bancorp files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits and all available evidence  that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution through protests  appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold  we measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described previously is recognized as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits  along with any related interest and penalties 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of tax expenses 
in deciding whether or not our tax positions taken meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex state and federal tax laws 
to the extent tax authorities disagree with tax positions taken by us  our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities 
revision of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning  which may affect our effective tax rates and our results of operations for any given quarter 
fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
securities available for sale  derivatives  and loans held for sale  if any  are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis  such as purchased loans recorded at acquisition date  certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other than temporarily impaired 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write downs of individual assets due to application of lower of cost or market accounting 
page we have established and documented a process for determining fair value 
we maximize the use of observable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
whenever there is no readily available market data  management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements 
for detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses non interest income non interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net income available to common stockholders net income per common share basic diluted page net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is impacted by changes in general market interest rates and by changes in the amounts and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk exposure with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on net interest margin 
net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest earning assets and the average rate incurred on total interest bearing liabilities 
both of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest margin is the higher of the two because it reflects interest income earned on assets funded with non interest bearing sources of funds  which include demand deposits and stockholders equity 
the following table  average statements of condition and analysis of net interest income  compares interest income and average interest earning assets with interest expense and average interest bearing liabilities for the periods presented

yields on available for sale securities are calculated based on amortized cost balances rather than fair value  as changes in fair value are reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
investment security interest is earned on basis monthly 
yields and interest income on tax exempt securities and loans are presented on a taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory rate of percent 
average balances on loans outstanding include non performing loans 
the amortized portion of net loan origination fees is included in interest income on loans  representing an adjustment to the yield 
amount includes thousand prepayment penalty in discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements of the annual report 
amount includes thousand accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs in the third quarter of compared with the tax equivalent net interest margin was in  compared to in the decrease of thirty nine basis points was primarily due to a lower yield on interest earning assets  mainly relating to a lower level of accretion on purchased loans 
this is partially offset by the reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities discussed below 
the net interest spread decreased twenty nine basis points over the same period for the same reasons 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased sixty two basis points in compared to the yield on the loan portfolio decreased sixty three basis points primarily due to the lower level of accretion and gains on payoffs on purchased loans  the downward repricing and rate concessions on existing loans and securities  as well as new loans and securities boarded at lower rates 
the loan portfolio as a percentage of average interest earning assets  decreased to at december   from at december  the overall yield on total investment securities decreased fifty three basis points  primarily due to lower yields on recently purchased securities in this low interest rate environment  as well as the accelerated amortization of purchase premiums 
page market interest rates are  in part  based on the target federal funds interest rate the interest rate banks charge each other for short term borrowings implemented by the federal reserve open market committee 
in december of  the target interest rate reached a historic low with a range of to where it remains as of december  other monetary policy measures taken by the federal reserve  including quantitative easing  also impact the interest rate environment 
in september of  the federal reserve announced a third round of quantitative easing  which is expected to exert further downward pricing pressure on our interest earning assets as interest rates remain low 
the rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased thirty three basis points at december  compared to december   primarily due to the absence of the thousand prepayment penalty  the maturity and early payoff of two higher costing fhlb borrowings late in and early in  and lower offering rates on deposits 
key components of our net interest margin fluctuation were as follows years ended december  december  dollars in thousands dollar amount basis point impact to net interest margin dollar amount basis point impact to net interest margin accretion on pci loans bps bps accretion on non pci loans bps bps gains on pay offs of pci loans bps bps interest recoveries bps interest reversals bps bps fhlb prepayment penalty september n a n a bps compared with tax equivalent net interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was due to an increase in volume of interest earning assets and the increase in loan yield  offset by the effect of lower yields on investment securities 
the tax equivalent net interest margin increased to in  up eighteen basis points from the increase in the tax equivalent net interest margin primarily reflects the acquisition of loans from the former charter oak bank and a reduction in the cost of deposits  partially offset by the thousand prepayment penalty on the fhlb advance in the third quarter of  as well as lower yields on investment securities and originated loans and a higher concentration of low yielding due from banks 
in  pci loans paid off early where the payoff amounts exceeded the recorded investment by million which favorably impacted our net interest margin by fifteen basis points 
accretion on the acquired non pci loans of million contributed twenty three basis points to the net interest margin 
the net interest spread increased twenty one basis points from the same period last year for the same reasons 
average interest earning assets increased million  or  in compared to this included increases in average interest earning due from banks of million  average investment securities of million and average loan growth of million mainly due to the acquisition on february  
the yield on interest earning assets increased three basis points in compared to the yield on the loan portfolio  which comprised and of average earning assets in and  respectively  increased forty basis points 
the accretion on the acquired non pci loans of million represents twenty nine basis points of the increase and the early payoff on pci loans where the payoff amounts exceeded the recorded investment by million represents nineteen basis points of the increase 
this increase is partially offset by the decrease in yields on investment securities due to lower yields on recently purchased securities in this low interest rate environment and a higher concentration of low yielding due from banks 
in addition  we have experienced downward repricing and rate concessions on the loan portfolio as well as the addition of new loans at lower current market rates 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to average deposits grew in most categories  except for cdars time deposits  which decreased million 
the increase page in average deposits was offset by a decrease in average fhlb borrowings of million due to the early pay off of a million fhlb fixed rate advance at on september  the rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased eighteen basis points in compared to  primarily reflecting lower offering rates on money market accounts  as well as the downward re pricing of time deposits as they mature 
in  the rate on other time deposits  cdars  and money market accounts decreased thirty three basis points  fifty eight basis points  and thirty one basis points  respectively 
the increase of in the rate on fhlb borrowings is due to the thousand prepayment penalty on the early pay off of the million fixed rate advance

page provision for loan losses management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on several factors including growth of the loan portfolio  analysis of probable losses in the portfolio  recent loss experience and the current economic climate 
actual losses on loans are charged against the allowance  and the allowance is increased by loss recoveries and through the provision for loan losses charged to expense 
for further discussion  see the section captioned critical accounting policies 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses is primarily due to fewer newly identified problem loans that have significant credit loss exposure 
the provision for loan losses included million related to the acquired loan portfolio  which did not recur in the allowance for loan losses of million totaled of loans at december   compared to at december  the decline from prior year primarily relates to current year charge offs of specific reserves established in  as well as fewer newly identified problem loans that have significant credit loss exposure due to their well secured nature  as noted above 
in addition  we have experienced a shift in the mix of loans toward those having a lower loss reserve factor 
net charge offs in totaled million compared to million in the prior year 
see the section captioned allowance for loan losses below for further analysis of the provision for loan losses 
non interest income the table below details the components of non interest income

as of december  and  assets under management totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in debit card interchange fees is primarily attributable to a steady increase in volume of debit card usage  as well as an increase in new accounts 
in june  the frb finalized a new regulation to restrict interchange fees charged for debit card transactions by banks with more than billion in assets 
although we are exempt under the page new rule  market pricing of the interchange fees may drive these revenues down 
the effect on market pricing  if any  may take time to realize 
therefore  we cannot quantify the ultimate impact of this rule on such interchange fees 
the increase in merchant interchange fees is primarily due to a change in january  whereby merchant interchange related expenses are recorded in other expense rather than net of fees 
in addition  merchant interchange fees increased due to higher merchant sales volume in the slight increase in bank owned life insurance boli income in compared to is primarily due to additional income earned on thousand in new policies purchased in february reflects the pre tax bargain purchase gain of thousand from the acquisition 
other income remained unchanged in when compared with compared with when comparing to  service charge income on deposit accounts increased due to a higher number of deposit accounts mainly from the acquisition  partially offset by a decrease in overdraft and non sufficient funds fee income  primarily due to the new regulatory restriction on overdraft fee assessments federal reserve regulation e  which was effective july  the increase in wmts income was due to higher estate settlement fees and higher rates charged on corporate trust related services in  as well as an increase in the number of accounts and customer relationships 
this was partially offset by volatility in the equity and bond markets which impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment fees 
as of december  and  assets under management totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in debit card interchange fees was primarily attributable to a steady increase in volume of debit card usage  as well as new accounts from the acquisition 
merchant interchange fees decreased due to one time billing adjustments that we incurred in the increase in boli income in compared to was primarily due to additional income earned on million in new policies purchased in late march other income increased due to higher credit card referral fees and check order income  relating to an increase in the number of customer accounts  as well as the gain on disposal of repossessed assets  safe deposit box rental income and wire fee income

the number of average fte totaled in and in the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses is primarily due to higher rent and common area maintenance expenses related to the expansion of our headquarters  the relocation of our san francisco and tiburon branches and a full year rent for our new branch in sonoma 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in compared to the prior year is mainly due to the addition of the sonoma branch in late the decrease in fdic insurance in compared to primarily reflects the revision to the fdic insurance assessment base 
in february  as required by the dodd frank act  the fdic approved a rule that changes the fdic insurance assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  defined as tier capital 
while the new rule expanded the assessment base  it lowered assessment rates to between and basis points on the broader base for banks in the lowest risk category 
the change was effective for the second quarter of since we have a solid core deposit base and do not rely heavily on borrowings and brokered deposits  the benefit of the lower assessment rate significantly outweighed the effect of a wider assessment base 
page the decrease in data processing expenses primarily reflects the re negotiation and execution of a new contract with our current data processing vendor that resulted in a reduction of our ongoing data processing expenses effective july   as well as the reduction in one time expenses associated with the acquisition in professional service expenses in decreased when compared to this is primarily due to thousand of professional costs associated with the acquisition in that did not recur in  partially offset by an increase in internal audit fees in  as well as the consulting costs related to the data processing contract re negotiation 
advertising expenses decreased in  primarily due to higher franchise expansion related expenses 
we recorded a core deposit intangible asset of thousand at acquisition  of which thousand was written off in the fourth quarter of and thousand was amortized during the write off was primarily due to higher than anticipated runoff of the acquired deposits and a significant decline in alternative funding costs since the acquisition 
the increase in other expenses is primarily due to increases in merchant interchange related expenses due to the reclassification to expense from income as discussed in the non interest income section above  as well as higher expenses relating to recruitment 
the increases were partially offset by the write off of certain facility and network fixed assets purchased from the fdic related to the acquisition settlement that did not recur in compared with the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated with branch expansion  as well as annual merit increases 
the number of average fte totaled and in and  respectively 
the increases in occupancy and equipment expense were mainly due to an increase in expenses related to branch expansion  including napa  sonoma and a full year of rent for our santa rosa branch  partially offset by a full year of cost savings from the relocation of our corte madera branch and leases re negotiated at lower rates 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased as reflected the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements of our old corte madera branch when it relocated in july the decrease in fdic insurance expenses compared to reflects the revision to the fdic insurance assessment base 
the decrease in fdic insurance also reflects the expiration of the fdic optional transaction account guarantee program tagp on december   which provided unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts 
we elected to pay a basis point surcharge per covered balances in excess of thousand from january to december the increase in data processing expense was due to thousand acquisition related expenses  an annual contractual rate increase  as well as additional ongoing fees relating to a higher number of accounts 
the increase in professional service expenses in when compared to primarily reflects expenses incurred related to the acquisition  including investment banking consultants  legal  accounting and valuation services 
additionally  we incurred more legal fees related to loan workouts in than in advertising expenses increased  primarily due to the additional expenses related to franchise expansion 
the increase in other non interest expense from was primarily due to higher costs associated with an increase in the volume of debit card usage  write offs of certain assets from the acquisition  the implementation of a bank wide customer service training program  higher travel expenses and higher telephone expenses 
page provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes totaled million at an effective tax rate of in  compared to million at an effective tax rate of in and million at an effective tax rate of in the increases in both the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate from and are primarily due to a higher level of pre tax income in these provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and california franchise tax based upon reported pre tax income  and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes such as earnings on qualified municipal securities  boli and certain tax exempt loans 
therefore  there are normal fluctuations in the effective rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax 
bancorp and the bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement which provides that income taxes shall be allocated between the parties on a separate entity basis

as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are charged off against the allowance 
the balance of our allowance for loan losses is management best estimate of the remaining probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including the real estate market  changes in interest rates and economic and political environments 
based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio  management believes that the million allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio 
the components of the allowance for loan losses as stated previously in critical accounting policies  and note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends  and an allowance for changing economic factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  economic factors  etc the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral  as applicable 
through management ongoing loan grading process and credit monitoring process  individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
these loans are evaluated individually for impairment by management and specific allowances for loan losses are established when the fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
pci loans are considered impaired when they experience credit deterioration  page ie the amount of cash flows expected to be collected decreases 
for loans determined to be impaired  the extent of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate at origination for originated loans or discounted at the effective yield for pci loans  based on the loan observable market price  or based on the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
generally with problem credits that are collateral dependent  we obtain appraisals of the collateral at least annually and evaluate quarterly 
impaired loan balances increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in impaired loans is primarily the result of two problem borrowing relationships and new troubled debt restructurings in the specific allowance decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in the specific allowance primarily relates to the charge offs of the uncollectible portion of impaired loans in  as certain impaired loans at december  were awaiting resolution of pending events before a determination could be made as to whether or not the loan should be charged off 
in addition  the newly identified impaired loans in are well secured and therefore do not require significant specific reserves 
lastly  we removed certain specific allowances on formerly impaired loans as they went back to accrual status in the second component  the allowance factor  is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major segments or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio 
this analysis encompasses our entire loan portfolio  but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above and excludes acquired non pci loans where the discount has not been fully accreted 
this analysis also includes loan types and economic and business conditions unique to each segment  including the bank own loss history 
for loans graded substandard and not already evaluated for impairment in the first component analysis above  they are also assigned an allowance factor 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose at least annually and by various bank regulatory agencies 
there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan at every reporting date 
therefore  it is possible that in the future some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loan types 
at december  and  the allowance allocated for the second component by categories of credits totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to the continued runoff of our construction loan portfolio  which has a higher loan loss reserve factors 
in addition  loans graded substandard decreased to million at december  from million at december  the third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  and economic trends 
this is management best estimate of the probable impact that economic changes may have on the loan portfolio as a whole 
the general valuation allowance  including the economic component and unallocated allowance  increased from million at december  to million at december  due to loan growth 
management proactively evaluates economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
after assessing the economic outlook  management did not revise the economic loss factor in nor in due to limited signs of economic recovery 
the economy has improved  although the rate of recovery has been slow due to the persistently high unemployment rate and restrained spending by consumers and businesses

the decrease primarily relates to million of charge offs related to the acquired loans in net charge offs reflected million in charge offs related to one commercial real estate borrowing relationship based on recent appraisal of the collateral 
the net charge offs have stemmed primarily from unsecured commercial loans  as well as commercial loans secured by real estate where the property value have declined

as permitted or required under california law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law  we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in  or not opposed to  our best interests  and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as we believe the possibility of potential claims to be remote and any amounts under the indemnifications would be covered by the insurance policy  we have not recorded an indemnification obligation 
capital adequacy as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the bank capital ratios are above regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized and bancorp ratios exceed the required minimum ratios for capital adequacy purposes 
the bank total risk based capital ratio increased from at december  to at december   primarily due to the accumulation of net income of the bank in of million  partially page offset by the repayment of million in subordinated debentures  as well as growth in total risk weighted assets  driven mainly by increases in the loan portfolio and investment securities 
bancorp total risk based capital ratio increased from at december  to at december   primarily due to the accumulation of net income of bancorp of million in  net of million in dividends paid to stockholders 
we expect to maintain strong capital levels 
our potential sources of capital include future earnings and shares issued upon the exercise of stock options 
in addition  the warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock remains outstanding 
the warrant  if exercised  would provide us with million additional tier capital 
liquidity the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet both loan demand and unexpected deposit withdrawals 
we accomplish this goal by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid assets  and formal lines of credit with the fhlb  frb and correspondent banks that enable us to borrow funds as needed 
our asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of certain directors of the bank  is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies 
management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
alco has also developed a contingency plan should liquidity drop unexpectedly below internal requirements 
we obtain funds from the repayment and maturity of loans as well as deposit inflows  investment security maturities and pay downs  federal funds purchases  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
our primary uses of funds are the origination of loans  the purchase of investment securities  withdrawals of deposits  maturity of certificate of deposits  repayment of borrowings and dividends to common stockholders 
we must attract and retain new deposits  which depends upon the variety and effectiveness of our customer account products  service and convenience  and rates paid to customers  as well as our financial strength 
any long term decline in retail deposit funding would adversely impact our liquidity 
the transaction account guarantee tag program  which fully insured non interest bearing transactions  expired on december  we do not anticipate a significant impact on our liquidity from the expiration of tag 
we do have borrowing capacity through fhlb and frb that can be drawn upon 
management anticipates our current strong liquidity position and our core deposit base will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations 
if we were to rely on federal funds purchased or fhlb advances in the future  we expect to have the ability to post adequate collateral for such funding requirements 
as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  the sources of liquidity vary between periods 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  a decrease of million from december  the primary uses of funds were million in investment securities purchases  million of loan originations  net of principal collections  million to repay an fhlb borrowing and million to repay a subordinated debenture 
the primary sources of funds during included a million increase in net deposits  million in pay downs and maturities of investment securities and million in net cash provided by operating activities 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and unpledged available for sale securities with estimated maturities within one year totaled million 
the remainder of the unpledged available for sale securities portfolio of million provides additional liquidity 
these liquid assets equaled of our assets at december   compared to at december  we anticipate that cash and cash equivalents on hand and other sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for our operating  investing and financing needs and our regulatory liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
management monitors our liquidity position daily  balancing loan funding payments with changes in deposit activity and overnight investments 
our emphasis on local deposits combined with our well capitalized equity position  provides a very stable funding base 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we have substantial additional borrowing capacity including unsecured lines of credit totaling million with correspondent banks 
further  we have pledged a certain residential loan portfolio to secure our borrowing capacity with the frb  which totaled million at december  as of december   there is no debt outstanding to correspondent banks or the frb 
we are also a member of the fhlb and have a line of credit secured under terms of a blanket collateral agreement by a pledge of essentially all of our financial assets in the amount of million  of which million was available at page december  borrowings under the line are limited to eligible collateral 
the interest rates on overnight borrowings with both correspondent banks and the fhlb are determined daily and generally approximate the federal funds target rate 
undisbursed loan commitments  which are not reflected on the consolidated statements of condition  totaled million at december  at rates ranging from to 
this amount included million under commercial lines of credit these commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards  million under revolving home equity lines  million under undisbursed construction loans  million under standby letters of credit  and a remaining million under personal and other lines of credit 
these commitments  to the extent used  are expected to be funded primarily through the repayment of existing loans  deposit growth and existing balance sheet liquidity 
over the next twelve months million of time deposits will mature 
we expect these funds to be replaced with new time deposits 
since bancorp is a holding company and does not conduct regular banking operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the bank 
under the california financial code  payment of a dividend from the bank to bancorp without advance regulatory approval is restricted to the lesser of the bank s retained earnings or the amount of the bank s undistributed net profits from the previous three fiscal years 
the primary uses of funds for bancorp are shareholder dividends and ordinary operating expenses 
bancorp held million of cash at december  bancorp obtained a dividend distribution from the bank of million in february of  which is anticipated to be sufficient to meet bancorp funding requirements through the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the risk is inherent in our deposit and lending activities 
management  together with alco  has sought to manage rate sensitivity and maturities of assets and liabilities to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
additionally  interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on our net interest margin 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
activities in asset and liability management include  but are not limited to  lending  borrowing  accepting deposits and investing in securities 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset and liability management 
sensitivity of net interest income nii and capital to interest rate changes results from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the consolidated statement of condition is managed with the objective of correlating the movements of interest rates on loans and investments with those of deposits and borrowings 
the asset and liability policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of change to nii and capital in changing interest rate environments 
we use simulation models to forecast nii 
from time to time  we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the changes in the fair value of specified long term fixed rate loans and firm commitments to enter into long term fixed rate loans caused by changes in interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the alco and the board of directors 
they utilize interest rate sensitivity simulation models as a tool for achieving these objectives and for developing ways in which to improve profitability 
a simplified statement of condition is prepared on a quarterly basis as a starting point  using as inputs  actual loans  investments  borrowings and deposits 
if potential changes to net equity value and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest changes are not within the limits established by the board of directors  management may adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within approved limits 
since  there has been no change to the federal funds target rate  which has been kept at a historic low level of 
the bank currently has low interest rate risk and is slightly asset sensitive 
the bank is less asset sensitive than at december   primarily because interest rate sensitive short term liquidity decreased and more fixed rate loans and securities were added in as shown in table below  if the market rates rise by more than basis points  we expect asset sensitivity to increase as most of our loans with interest rates on floors will start to float again as loans reprice and net interest income will increase 
we have mitigated earnings sensitivity to a certain extent through the procurement of a fixed rate borrowing from the fhlb and interest rate swaps 
page in the following simulation of nii under various interest rate scenarios  the simplified statement of condition is processed against four interest rate change scenarios  in basis point increments 
each of these scenarios assumes that the change in interest rates is immediate and interest rates remain at the new levels 
for modeling purposes  the likelihood of a decrease in interest rates beyond basis points as of december  was considered to be remote given prevailing low interest rate levels 
therefore  a reduction in rate scenario is not considered in the following table at december  however  the bank net interest margin is expected to decline slightly in a flat rate environment as maturing repricing loans and securities are reinvested at today lower rates 
in addition  market rates for loans have been falling under pressure from the competition 
table summarizes the effect on nii due to changing interest rates as measured against the flat rate scenario 
table effect of interest rate change on net interest income at december  changes in interest rates in basis points estimated change in nii as percent of nii up up up up the above table estimates the impact of interest rate changes 
the estimated changes are within our policy guidelines established by alco and the board of directors 
the table indicates that at december   we were less asset sensitive in a rising interest rate environment compared to december  the results shown reflect a lag in the upward re pricing of loans due to loans on floors 
as stated previously in the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business of this report  the dodd frank act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transactions and other accounts beginning july  we have not incurred significant interest expense on business transaction accounts since the legislation took effect in july if we were to pay interest on certain deposits that are currently non interest bearing  causing these deposits to become rate sensitive in the future  we will become less asset sensitive than the model currently indicates 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
as with any simulation model or other method of measuring interest rate risk  certain limitations are inherent in the process 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the changes in interest rates on certain categories of either our assets or liabilities may precede or lag changes in market interest rates 
further  the actual rates and timing of prepayments on loans and investment securities could vary significantly from the assumptions used in the various scenarios 
lastly  changes in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the yield curve could produce different results from those presented in the table 
accordingly  the results presented should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates
