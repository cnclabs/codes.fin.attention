item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview general we are a real estate investment trust  or reit  that was incorporated under the general corporation law of the state of maryland on february   primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial  commercial and retail real property and selectively making long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans 
our portfolio of real estate is leased to a wide cross section of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies  many of which are corporations that do not have publicly rated debt 
we have historically entered into  and intend in the future to enter into  purchase agreements for real estate having triple net leases with terms of approximately to years and built in rental rate increases 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
we actively communicate with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or to provide mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
we currently own properties totaling million square feet  which have a total gross and net carrying value  including intangible assets  of million and million  respectively 
we do not currently have any mortgage loan receivables outstanding 
business environment the united states  or us  continues to feel the lingering impact of the recession that began in late the us is beginning to see long term signs of recovery as the unemployment rate has decreased over the last several months  housing starts and building permits rose in september to the highest level in four years  and prices for single family homes increased across us cities because of a dwindling surplus in the housing market 
however  the economic situation in europe continues to be unpredictable and will need to stabilize for the economy to fully recover and the us will need to come to a long term solution for the debt crisis the country currently faces 
as a result  conditions within the us capital markets generally  and the us real estate capital markets particularly  continue to experience certain levels of dislocation and stress 
these economic conditions could materially and adversely impact the financial condition of one or more of our tenants and  therefore  could increase the likelihood that a tenant may declare bankruptcy or default upon its payment obligations arising under a related lease 
we currently have two vacant buildings in our portfolio  one of the buildings is located in hazelwood  missouri and the other building is located in richmond  virginia 
the leases on these two vacant buildings comprised of our annualized rental income as of december  and the annual carrying costs are million 
we are actively seeking new tenants for both of these buildings 
all of our remaining properties are currently occupied and the tenants are paying in accordance with their leases 
however  in january  we were notified by our tenant in our baytown  texas property that they would not be renewing the lease that expires in april we are aggressively pursuing new tenants for this building 
this tenant comprised less than of our annualized rental income as of december  moreover  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon our ability to procure external financing 
our principal sources of external financing generally include the issuance of equity securities  long term mortgage loans secured by properties and borrowings under our line of credit  or the line of credit 
the market for long term mortgages was limited for the past several years  however  long term mortgages have become more obtainable 
the collateralized mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  market has made a comeback  but it is more conservative and restrictive than it was prior to the recession 
consequently  we continue to look to regional banks  insurance companies and other non bank lenders  in addition to the cmbs market to issue mortgages to finance our real estate activities 

table of contents in addition to leverage  we were active in the equity markets during and we issued  of common shares for gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds of million  through our at the market  or atm program and million of series c cumulative term preferred stock  or term preferred stock  which is mandatorily redeemable five years from issuance

advisory and administration agreements we are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our adviser and our administrator 
our adviser and administrator employ all of our personnel and pay their payroll  benefits and general expenses directly 
we have an investment advisory agreement with our adviser  or the advisory agreement  and an administration agreement with our administrator  or the administration agreement 
under the terms of the advisory agreement  we are responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include legal  accounting  interest on short term debt and mortgages  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  stockholder related fees  consulting and related fees 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
management services and fees under the advisory agreement the advisory agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to of our total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock  or total common stockholders equity  and for an incentive fee based on funds from operations  or ffo

furthermore  there are no fees charged when our adviser secures long or short term credit or arranges mortgage loans on our properties  however  our adviser may earn fee income from our borrowers or tenants or other sources 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee  ffo includes any realized capital gains and capital losses  less any distributions paid on preferred stock and senior common stock  but ffo does not include any unrealized capital gains or losses 
the incentive fee would reward our adviser if our quarterly ffo  before giving effect to any incentive fee  or pre incentive fee ffo  exceeds  or the hurdle rate  of total common stockholders equity 
we pay our adviser an incentive fee with respect to our pre incentive fee ffo quarterly as follows no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre incentive fee ffo does not exceed the hurdle rate of annualized  of the amount of the pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds the hurdle rate  but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized  and of the amount of our pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized 

table of contents quarterly incentive fee based on ffo pre incentive fee ffo expressed as a percentage of total common stockholders equity logo percentage of pre incentive fee ffo allocated to the incentive fee the incentive fee may be reduced because of a covenant which exists in our line of credit agreement which limits distributions to our stockholders to of ffo with acquisition related costs that are required to be expensed under asc  business combinations  added back to ffo 
in order to comply with this covenant  our board of directors accepted our adviser s offer to unconditionally  irrevocably and voluntarily waive on a quarterly basis a portion of the incentive fee for the years ended december   and  which allowed us to maintain the current level of distributions to our stockholders 
these waived fees may not be recouped by our adviser in the future

our allocable portion of expenses is generally derived by multiplying our administrator s total expenses by the percentage of our total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature in order to make certain estimates and assumptions 
application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
a summary of all of our significant accounting policies is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
below is a summary of accounting polices involving estimates and assumptions that require complex  subjective or significant judgments in their application and that materially affect our results of operations 
allocation of purchase price when we acquire real estate  we allocate the purchase price to i the acquired tangible assets and liabilities  consisting of land  building  tenant improvements and long term debt and ii the identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  in place leases  unamortized lease origination costs  tenant relationships and capital lease obligations  based in each case on their fair values 
all expenses related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized into the cost of the acquisition as had been required by the previous accounting 
our adviser estimates value using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
our adviser also consider information obtained about each property as a 
table of contents result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease up periods  which primarily range from to months  depending on specific local market conditions 
our adviser also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
our adviser also considers the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and management s expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
a change in any of the assumptions above  which are very subjective  could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements the amount of purchase price allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet  the amounts allocated to the value of above market and below market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense 
thus  depending on the amounts allocated between land and other depreciable assets  changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our ffo  a metric which is used by many reit investors to evaluate our operating performance  and the period of time over which tangible and intangible assets are depreciated varies greatly  and thus  changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations 
intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective life of the leases  which normally range from to years 
also  we depreciate our buildings over years  but do not depreciate our land 
these differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
asset impairment evaluation we periodically review the carrying value of each property to determine if circumstances that indicate impairment in the carrying value of the investment exist or that depreciation periods should be modified 
in determining if impairment exists  our adviser considers such factors as our tenants payment histories  the financial condition of our tenants  including calculating the current leverage ratios of tenants  the likelihood of lease renewal  business conditions in the industries in which our tenants operate and whether the carrying value of our real estate has decreased 
if any of the factors above indicate the possibility of impairment  we prepare a projection of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific property and determine if the carrying amount of such property is recoverable 
in preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows  we estimate the holding periods of the properties and cap rates using information that we obtain from market comparability studies and other comparable sources 
if impairment were indicated  the carrying value of the property would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property s discounted future cash flows using assumptions from market participants 
any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results of operations  as the changes would impact our determination of whether impairment is deemed to have occurred and the amount of impairment loss that we would recognize 
using the methodology discussed above and in light of the current economic conditions discussed above in overview business environment  we evaluated our entire portfolio as of december  for any impairment indicators and performed an impairment analysis on those select properties that had an indication of impairment 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that none of our properties were impaired and we will continue to monitor our portfolio for any indicators of impairment 

table of contents results of operations the weighted average yield on our total portfolio was as of december  the weighted average yield on our portfolio is calculated by taking the annualized straight line rents  reflected as rental income on our consolidated statements of operations  of each acquisition as a percentage of the acquisition 
the weighted average yield does not account for the interest expense incurred on the mortgages placed on our properties

table of contents property operating expenses consist of franchise taxes  management fees  insurance  ground lease payments and overhead expenses paid on behalf of certain of our properties 
property operating expenses increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because of ground lease payments we are responsible for paying at two of our properties acquired in the fourth quarter of  coupled with an increase in overhead expenses and franchise taxes paid at certain of our vacant properties

liquidity and capital resources overview our sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our line of credit  obtaining mortgages on our unencumbered properties and issuing additional equity securities 
our available liquidity at december   was million  including million in cash and cash equivalents and an available borrowing capacity of million under our line of credit 
future capital needs we actively seek conservative investments that are likely to produce income to pay distributions to our stockholders 
we intend to use the proceeds received from future equity raised and debt capital borrowed to continue to invest in industrial  commercial and retail real property  make mortgage loans  or pay down outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
accordingly  to ensure that we are able to effectively execute our business strategy  we routinely review our liquidity requirements and continually evaluate all potential sources of liquidity 
our short term liquidity needs include proceeds necessary to fund our distributions to stockholders  pay the debt service costs on our existing long term mortgages  and fund our current operating costs 
our long term liquidity needs include proceeds necessary to grow and maintain our portfolio of investments 
we believe that our available liquidity is sufficient to fund our distributions to stockholders  pay the debt service costs on our existing long term mortgages and fund our current operating costs in the near term 
we further believe that our cash flow from operations coupled with the financing capital available to us in the future are sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs 
additionally  to satisfy either our short term or long term obligations  or both  we may require credits to our management fees that are issued from our adviser  although our adviser is under no obligation to provide any such credits  either in whole or in part 
equity capital during  we raised million of common equity under our atm program  or million in net proceeds  at an average share price of 
we also raised million in net proceeds of senior common equity

the cmbs market has returned  see the discussion in overview business environment above 
specifically  we continue to see banks and other non bank lenders willing to issue year mortgages 
consequently  we are focused on obtaining mortgages through regional banks  non bank lenders and cmbs 
we have mortgage debt in the aggregate principal amount of million payable during and million payable during the and principal amounts payable includes both amortizing principal payments and balloon principal payments due in december of of million and june of of million  however  we are initiating conversations with these lenders in advance of these maturities and anticipate being able to extend the maturity dates or refinance with new lenders 
we intend to pay the and debt amortization payments from operating cash flow and borrowings under our line of credit 
our line of credit matures in december we are currently in discussions with both our existing lender and various other lenders to either renew our existing line or to implement a new line of credit 
we anticipate being able to extend or issue a new line in advance of the maturity of our existing line in an amount similar to our existing line of credit 
if we cannot find replacement financing  we would not have enough existing liquidity to continue our existing operations 
if that were to happen  management would pursue and expect to obtain an extension from the current lender in order to provide additional time to obtain replacement financing 
in the unlikely scenario that we are unable to find replacement financing  management has reviewed its cash uses and sources and has identified plans that could be implemented to continue operations despite the maturity of the line of credit 
these steps could include suspension of capital spending  cost reductions  an equity raise and possible asset disposals 
additionally management has assessed that the remaining assets in the portfolio would produce sufficient cash flows to fund operating cash needs and meet remaining debt service requirements in the near term 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december   was million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of rental income received from the eight properties acquired in  partially offset by million of leasing commissions paid for renewing existing leases 
the majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments that we receive from our tenants 
we utilize this cash to fund our property level operating expenses and use the excess cash primarily for debt and interest payments on our mortgage notes payable  interest payments on our line of credit  distributions to our stockholders  management fees to our adviser  and other entity level expenses

line of credit in december  we procured a million line of credit maturing on december   with capital one  na serving as a revolving lender  a letter of credit issuer and an administrative agent and branch banking and trust company serving as a revolving lender and letter of credit issuer 
the line of credit originally provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million  with a standby letter of credit sublimit of up to million 
in january  the line of credit was expanded to million and citizens bank of pennsylvania was added as a revolving lender and letter of credit issuer 
the interest rate per annum applicable to the line of credit is equal to the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus an applicable margin of up to depending upon our leverage 
our leverage ratio used in determining the applicable margin for interest on the line of credit is recalculated quarterly 
we are subject to an annual maintenance fee of per year 
our ability to access this source of financing is subject to our continued ability to meet customary lending requirements such as compliance with financial and operating covenants and our meeting certain lending limits 
one such covenant requires us to limit distributions to our stockholders to of our ffo  with acquisition related costs required to be expensed under asc added back to ffo for covenant purposes 
in addition  the maximum amount that we may draw under this agreement is based on a percentage of the value of properties pledged as collateral to the banks  which must meet agreed upon eligibility standards 
currently  of our properties are pledged as collateral under our line of credit 
when we are able to procure mortgages for these pledged properties  the banks will release the properties from the line of credit and reduce the availability under the line of credit by the advanced amount of the released property 
conversely  as we purchase new properties meeting the eligibility standards  we may pledge these new properties to obtain additional advances under the line of credit 
our availability under the line of credit will also be reduced by letters of credit used in the ordinary course of business 
we may use the advances under the line of credit for both general corporate purposes and the acquisition of new investments 
as of february   there was million outstanding under the line of credit at an interest rate of approximately and million outstanding under letters of credit at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of february   the remaining borrowing capacity available under the line of credit was million 
our ability to increase the availability under our line of credit is dependent upon our pledging additional properties as collateral 
traditionally  we have pledged new properties to the line of credit as we arrange for long term mortgages for these pledged properties 
currently  only of our properties do not have long term mortgages  and of those are pledged as collateral under our line of credit 
accordingly  we have only properties which are unencumbered 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the line of credit as of december  
table of contents contractual obligations the following table reflects our material contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations interest on debt obligations operating lease obligations total debt obligations represent borrowings under our line of credit  which represents million of the debt obligation due in  mortgage notes payable that were outstanding as of december  and amounts due to the holders of our term preferred stock 
interest on debt obligations includes estimated interest on our borrowings under our line of credit  mortgage notes payable and interest due to the holders of our term preferred stock 
the balance and interest rate on our line of credit is variable  thus  the amount of interest calculated for purposes of this table was based upon rates and balances as of december  operating lease obligations represent the ground lease payments due on our tulsa  oklahoma  dartmouth  massachusetts  and springfield  missouri properties 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk that we believe we are and will be exposed to is interest rate risk 
four of our sixty five leases contain escalations based on market indices  and the interest rate on our existing line of credit is variable 
although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions of our loans and leases to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable  these features do not eliminate this risk 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to attempt to further manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income for the year ended december   we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and that no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
the following table summarizes the impact of a  and increase in the one month libor for the year ended december  as of december   our effective average libor was  thus  a  or decrease could not occur 
dollars in thousands interest rate change increase to rental income increase to interest expense net decrease to net income increase to libor increase to libor increase to libor as of december   the fair value of our fixed rate mortgage debt outstanding was million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments  using rates at december   had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased by million and million  respectively 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our line of credit or long term mortgage debt  which we use to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees and borrowers  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt  if necessary
