the following tables set forth operating metrics with respect to the krispy kreme stores operated by the company all of which are located in the united states and the stores operated by the company s domestic and international franchisees 
the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to january  which periodically results in a week year 
fiscal included weeks 
operating metrics in the table below for fiscal are presented for the weeks ended january  in order to enhance comparability of the fiscal metrics with those for fiscal and  each of which contained weeks 
weeks ended january  january  january  change in same store sales on premises sales only company stores domestic franchise stores international franchise stores international franchise stores  in constant dollars change in same store customer count company stores retail sales only average guest check company stores retail sales only wholesale metrics company stores only average weekly number of doors served grocers mass merchants    convenience stores    average weekly sales per door grocers mass merchants convenience stores systemwide sales in thousands company stores    domestic franchise stores    international franchise stores    international franchise stores  in constant dollars  average weekly sales per store in thousands company stores factory stores commissaries wholesale dual channel stores on premises wholesale total on premises only stores all factory stores satellite stores all stores domestic franchise stores factory stores satellite stores international franchise stores factory stores satellite stores represents the change in international franchise same store sales computed by reconverting franchise store sales in each foreign currency to us dollars at a constant rate of exchange for each period 
excludes sales among company and franchise stores 
systemwide sales is a non gaap measure 
represents international franchise store sales computed by reconverting international franchise store sales for the year ended january  and january  to us dollars based upon the weighted average of the exchange rates prevailing in the year ended february  includes sales between company and franchise stores 
metrics reflect only stores open at the respective period end 
the change in same store sales is computed by dividing the aggregate on premises sales including fundraising sales during the current year period for all stores which had been open for more than consecutive weeks during the current year but only to the extent such sales occurred in the th or later week of each store s operation by the aggregate on premises sales of such stores for the comparable weeks in the preceding year 
once a store has been open for at least consecutive weeks  its sales are included in the computation of same store sales for all subsequent periods 
in the event a store is closed temporarily for example  for remodeling and has no sales during one or more weeks  such store s sales for the comparable weeks during the earlier or subsequent period are excluded from the same store sales computation 
the change in same store customer count is similarly computed  but is based upon the number of retail transactions reported in the company s point of sale system 
for wholesale sales  average weekly number of doors represents the average number of customer locations to which product deliveries were made during a week  and average weekly sales per door represents the average weekly sales to each such location 
systemwide sales  a non gaap financial measure  include sales by both company and franchise krispy kreme stores 
the company believes systemwide sales data are useful in assessing consumer demand for the company s products  the overall success of the krispy kreme brand and  ultimately  the performance of the company 
all of the company s royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by the company s domestic and international franchisees  and substantially all of kk supply chain s external sales of doughnut mixes and other ingredients ultimately are determined by demand for the company s products at franchise stores 
accordingly  sales by the company s franchisees have a direct effect on the company s royalty and kk supply chain revenues  and therefore on the company s profitability 
the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein include sales by company stores  sales to franchisees by the kk supply chain business segment  and royalties and fees received from franchise stores based on their sales  but exclude sales by franchise stores to their customers

fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion of the company s results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
matters affecting comparability the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to january  which periodically results in a week year 
the year ended february  included weeks  compared to weeks for the year ended january  accordingly  financial results for fiscal are not directly comparable to those of fiscal additionally  the company s provision for income taxes  net income and earnings per share for fiscal are not comparable to the corresponding amounts for fiscal as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the resulting increase in income tax expense in fiscal the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards and  accordingly  the company s cash payments for income taxes  which were not affected by the reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  are expected to remain insignificant for the foreseeable future 
see results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes below  and note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
finally  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a gain of approximately million on the sale of its equity interest in kk mexico approximately million after deduction of approximately million of mexican taxes payable on the transaction  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
such gains should not be expected to occur regularly 
management evaluates the company s results of operations using  among other measures  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share  which include the provision for income taxes only to the extent such taxes are currently payable in cash 
in addition  management excludes from adjusted net income charges and credits that are unusual and infrequently occurring 
management believes adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are useful performance measures because they more closely measure the cash flows generated by the company s operations and the trends in those cash flows than do gaap net income and earnings per share  and because they exclude the effects of transactions that are not indicative of the company s ongoing results of operations 
adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non gaap measures 
the following presentation of adjusted net income  and the related reconciliation of adjusted net income to gaap net income and presentation of adjusted earnings per share  are intended to assist the reader in understanding the effects of the reversal of the valuation allowance and the non recurring gain on the sale of the interest in kk mexico on the company s results of operations for fiscal  facilitate comparisons of fiscal results with the company s results for fiscal  and illustrate the material difference between the company s income tax expense and income taxes currently payable 
these non gaap performance measures are consistent with other measurements made by management in the operation of the business which do not consider income taxes except to the extent to which those taxes currently are payable  for example  capital allocation decisions and incentive compensation measurements that are made on a pretax basis

consolidated operating income increased to million in fiscal of which approximately million relates to the rd week from million in fiscal consolidated net income was million compared to million 
consolidated net income for fiscal included an unusual credit of million from the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and a million after tax gain on the sale of the company s equity interest in kk mexico

includes rent  property taxes  common area maintenance charges  insurance  building maintenance and other occupancy costs  exclusive of utilities and depreciation 
includes marketing costs not charged to stores  segment management costs  wholesale selling expenses and support functions 
a reconciliation of company stores segment sales from fiscal to fiscal follows on premises wholesale total in thousands sales for the year ended january   fiscal sales at closed stores fiscal sales at closed stores increase in sales at established stores open stores only   increase in sales at stores opened in fiscal   sales at stores opened in fiscal   sales at stores acquired in fiscal   sales for the year ended february     sales at company stores increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding the rd week  sales increased to million 
selling price increases in the on premises and wholesale distribution channels accounted for approximately percentage points of the increase in sales  exclusive of the effects of higher pricing on unit volumes  such effects are difficult to measure reliably 
as with all consumer products  however  higher prices may negatively affect sales 
the company believes this phenomenon is more pronounced in the wholesale channel where competing products are merchandised alongside those of the company 
the following table presents sales metrics for company stores weeks ended january  january  on premises change in same store sales change in same store customer count retail sales only average guest check retail sales only wholesale grocers mass merchants change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door convenience stores change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door on premises sales the components of the change in same store sales at company stores are as follows weeks ended january  january  change in same store sales attributable to retail pricing guest check average exclusive of the effects of pricing customer count other total on premises sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week  on premises sales increased to million 
the company is developing and implementing new and enhanced marketing programs designed to increase guest visit frequency 
in addition to improved marketing programs  management believes that customer traffic has been positively affected by ongoing store remodelings  an emphasis on hospitality  and continued use of creative limited time doughnut offerings 
additionally  approximately percentage points of the sales increase reflects retail price increases implemented in the first quarter of fiscal on march   the company implemented price increases at substantially all its stores designed to help offset the rising costs of doughnut mixes  other ingredients and fuel resulting from higher commodity prices 
these price increases affected items comprising approximately of on premises sales  and the average price increase on these items was approximately 
on february   the company implemented on premises price increases averaging approximately in its company shops 
higher customer traffic was the principal driver of the improvement in same store sales  although cannibalization and honeymoon effects of new stores in expansion markets dampened somewhat the gain in same store customer count in fiscal cannibalization effect means the tendency for new stores to become successful  in part or in whole  by shifting sales from existing stores in the same market 
honeymoon effect means the common pattern for many start up restaurants in which a flurry of activity due to start up publicity and natural curiosity is followed by a decline during which a steady repeat customer base develops 
wholesale distribution sales to wholesale accounts increased to million in fiscal compared to in fiscal excluding the rd week  sales to wholesale accounts increased to million 
approximately percentage points of the sales increase is due to price increases 
the company started implementing price increases for some products offered in the wholesale channel late in the first quarter of fiscal  and substantially completed implementing the increases during the second quarter 
those price increases affected products comprising approximately of wholesale sales  and the average price increase on those products was approximately 
the company currently plans to implement modest price increases in the wholesale distribution channel in the second or third quarter of fiscal sales to grocers and mass merchants increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week  sales to grocers and mass merchants increased  with an increase in average weekly sales per door partially offset by a decline in the average number of doors served 
the decline in the average number of doors served in the grocery mass merchant channel reflects  among other things  store closures by a regional grocery store customer as well as the elimination of loose doughnut sales at another regional grocer  although the company continues to sell packaged products to this customer 
sales of loose unpackaged products comprised approximately of sales to grocery mass merchant customers for fiscal  with the balance comprised of sales of packaged products 
convenience store sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week  sales to convenience stores increased  reflecting an increase in the average weekly sales per door partially offset by a decline in the average number of doors served 
the decline in the average number of doors served in the convenience store channel reflects  among other things  a reduction in the number of stops at relatively low volume doors  as well as the loss of a regional convenience store account 
sales of loose unpackaged products comprised approximately of sales to convenience store customers for fiscal  with the balance comprised of sales of packaged products 
costs and expenses total cost of sales as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage points from in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal the cost of food  beverage and packaging as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the aggregate purchase price increases for food  beverage and packaging were very slight 
the decline in food  beverage and packaging as a percentage of revenues reflects improved materials consumption and a greater percentage of sales derived from on premises customers compared to fiscal  and lower product returns on wholesale distribution 
the company s supply chain has entered into contracts to purchase approximately half of its flour requirements for fiscal  together with approximately of its shortening requirements  and all of its estimated sugar requirements 
based upon current market forecasts  the company expects its aggregate cost of ingredients and packaging to rise modestly in fiscal compared to fiscal  and expects to recover these higher costs through price increases or cost reduction measures 
the company s contracts for sugar also cover substantially all of its estimated fiscal requirements 
shop labor as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage points from fiscal to of revenues in fiscal  principally due to higher revenues and improved labor cost management 
vehicle costs as a percentage of revenues decreased from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal  principally due to higher sales resulting from price increases and lower fuel costs due to a reduction in mileage due to the reduction in the number of wholesale doors served 
many segment operating costs are fixed or semi fixed in nature and  accordingly  segment profit margins are sensitive to changes in sales volumes 
the company is self insured for workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  but maintains stop loss coverage for individual claims exceeding certain amounts 
the company provides for claims under these self insured programs using actuarial methods as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and periodically updates actuarial valuations of its self insurance reserves at least annually 
such periodic actuarial valuations result in changes over time in the estimated amounts which ultimately will be paid for claims under these programs to reflect the company s actual claims experience for each policy year as well as trends in claims experience over multiple years 
such claims  particularly workers compensation claims  often are paid over a number of years following the year in which the insured events occur  and the estimated ultimate cost of each year s claims accordingly is adjusted over time as additional information becomes available 
as a result of the periodic update of its actuarial valuation  the company recorded favorable adjustments for changes in estimates to its self insurance claims liabilities related to prior policy years of approximately  in fiscal  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter  and million in  of which  million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
the  in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal includes an unfavorable adjustment relating to workers compensation liability claims of approximately  included in employee benefits in the table above  a favorable adjustment relating to vehicle liability claims of approximately  included in vehicle costs  and a favorable adjustment relating to general liability claims of approximately  included in other operating costs 
an additional  of favorable adjustments was recorded in other segments of the business 
the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal includes favorable adjustments of million relating to workers compensation liability claims   relating to vehicle liability claims and  relating to general liability claims 
depreciation expense increased in fiscal to of revenues from in fiscal due to increased capital expenditures in fiscal and including construction of new stores  store refurbishment efforts on existing stores and investments in information technology systems 
the patient protection and affordable care act the act requires businesses employing fifty or more full time equivalent employees to offer health care benefits to those full time employees beginning in january  or be subject to an annual penalty 
those benefits must be provided under a health care plan which provides a certain minimum scope of health care services 
the act limits the portion of the cost of the benefits which the company can require employees to pay 
the company currently employs a substantial number of persons to whom the company does not currently provide health care benefits but who could be entitled to receive health care benefits under the act 
the company does not know the amount by which its costs will increase assuming the above provisions of the act are implemented in january because  among other reasons  many of the specifics relating to implementation  including certain of the specifics of the coverage required to be offered  are to be contained in regulations which have not yet been drafted 
in addition  the company does not know how many of the potentially newly eligible employees will elect to obtain coverage under the act 
however  based on information currently available to the company and the company s analyses to date and its current cost estimates  management currently does not expect that the aggregate incremental cost of providing health care coverage prescribed by the act will exceed its current costs by more than approximately million annually 
the company currently believes its incremental costs will be less than such amount  and may be substantially less 
the company is continuing to study and evaluate the requirements of the act  and the company s estimate of the additional cost of providing benefits mandated by the act is expected to change as the company gains additional information and makes decisions affecting its implementation of the act s requirements 
domestic franchise year ended february  january  in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees other total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead total operating expenses   segment operating income   domestic franchise revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week  domestic franchise revenues increased to million 
on a week basis  the increase reflects higher domestic royalty revenues resulting from an increase in sales by domestic franchise stores from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partially offset by a reduction in other franchise revenue 
domestic franchise same store sales rose in fiscal domestic franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new domestic franchisees  to assist in domestic store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of domestic franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
domestic franchise operating expenses in fiscal included a provision of  for payments under a lease guarantee associated with a franchisee whose franchise agreements the company terminated 
this provision was partially offset by the reversal of a previously recorded accrual of  related to a franchisee lease guarantee as a result of the company receiving a release from the related guarantee during fiscal the decrease in domestic franchise operating expenses also reflects a decline in legal and trademark protection costs of approximately  of which approximately  is related to the fiscal franchisee termination 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company added new personnel to the domestic franchise segment and in fiscal expects to incur additional franchise marketing costs in connection with management s plan to reengage in franchise expansion efforts to drive domestic franchise unit growth 
domestic franchisees opened nine stores and closed seven stores in fiscal on august   the company acquired two krispy kreme stores from one of its domestic franchisees as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
as of february   existing development and franchise agreements for territories in the united states provide for the development of additional stores through fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
international franchise year ended february  january  in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees   total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead   total operating expenses   segment operating income   international franchise royalties were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week  international franchise royalties increased  driven by an increase in sales by international franchise stores from million in fiscal to million in fiscal measured on a week basis 
changes in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business decreased sales by international franchisees measured in us dollars by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  which adversely affected international royalty revenues by approximately  royalties and franchise fees in fiscal included approximately  and  respectively  of amounts relating to the company s franchisee in mexico which were accrued in prior periods but which had not previously been reported as revenue because of uncertainty surrounding their collection 
such amounts were reported as revenue in recognition of the payment of such amounts to the company on may   in connection with the company s sale of its equity interest in the franchisee  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
international franchise same store sales  measured on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of changing exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar constant dollar same store sales  fell 
the decline in international franchise same store sales reflects  among other things  waning honeymoon effects from the large number of new stores opened internationally in recent years and the cannibalization effects on initial stores in new markets of additional store openings in those markets 
constant dollar same store sales in established markets fell in fiscal and fell in new markets 
established markets means countries in which the first krispy kreme store opened before fiscal sales at stores in established markets comprised approximately of aggregate sales underlying the constant dollar same store sales metric 
while the company considers countries in which krispy kreme first opened before fiscal to be established markets  franchisees in those markets continue to develop their business 
of the international shops currently in operation that opened since the beginning of fiscal  shops are in these established markets 
international franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new international franchisees  to assist in international store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of international franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
international franchise operating expenses were flat at million in fiscal compared to fiscal international franchise operating expenses in fiscal reflect a decline in legal fees associated with certain litigation as well as lower share based compensation expense compared to fiscal share based compensation expense was elevated in fiscal as a result of an executive officer in the segment achieving retirement eligibility under the terms of the company s stock compensation plan 
share based payment awards to retirement eligible persons are charged to expense at the grant date rather than being amortized over the four year vesting period of the awards 
in addition  in fiscal  the company recorded a net credit of  to the bad debt provision principally related to the mexican franchisee discussed above  while fiscal expenses include a charge to bad debt expense of  management expects international franchise operating expenses to rise in fiscal due to personnel additions to support international franchise growth  as well as anticipated fiscal shop openings in new markets  which typically require a greater level of franchisor support than openings in existing markets 
international franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal as of february   existing development and franchise agreements for territories outside the united states provide for the development of additional stores through fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
kk supply chain the components of kk supply chain revenues and expenses expressed in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination are set forth in the table below percentage amounts may not add to totals due to rounding 
percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination year ended year ended february  january  february  january  in thousands revenues doughnut mixes   other ingredients  packaging and supplies   equipment   fuel surcharge   total revenues before intersegment sales elimination operating expenses cost of sales cost of goods produced and purchased   gain loss on agricultural derivatives inbound freight   total cost of sales   distribution costs   other segment operating costs   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead   total operating costs   segment operating income   kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales eliminations were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the rd week  kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales eliminations increased 
sales of doughnut mixes rose on a week basis in fiscal  reflecting higher unit volumes partially offset by lower selling prices resulting from a reduction in raw materials costs 
sales of other ingredients  packaging and supplies  made principally to company and domestic franchise stores  rose on a week basis fiscal due to higher selling prices of sugar partially offset by lower unit volumes in certain categories 
while week systemwide sales at company and domestic franchise stores rose in fiscal compared to fiscal  a greater percentage of such systemwide sales was to on premises customers compared to wholesale customers in fiscal on premises sales at company and domestic franchise stores generate proportionately lower kk supply chain sales than do sales to wholesale customers  because the average customer unit selling price in the on premises channel is generally higher than in the wholesale channel and because the product returns associated with wholesale distribution generate significant waste 
in addition  the company outsourced distribution to its international franchise stores in fiscal  which resulted in a reduction in sales of non mix products to those franchisees 
kk supply chain utilizes a fuel surcharge program to recoup additional freight costs resulting from increases in fuel costs 
charges under the program are based upon the price of diesel fuel 
kk supply chain input costs increased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal  principally as a result of an approximate increase in the cost of sugar 
while the company raised selling prices to recover higher sugar costs  the company did not mark up such higher costs  which resulted in an increase in the overall cost of goods produced and purchased as a percentage of revenues 
inbound freight as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points in fiscal as a result of outsourcing product distribution for stores east of the mississippi to a third party provider beginning in fiscal these increased inbound freight costs were substantially offset by a reduction in distribution costs and other segment operating costs  which include segment management  purchasing and customer service and support expenses associated with the outsourcing of product distribution 
other segment operating expenses in fiscal also included a charge of approximately  for the settlement of certain sales tax litigation 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal a substantial portion of kk supply chain s revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
an increasing percentage of franchise store sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
while the company sells doughnut mixes and concentrates to its international franchisees  these franchisees purchase substantially all other ingredients  packaging and supplies from local or regional vendors approved by the company 
accordingly  kk supply chain revenues are less correlated with sales by international franchisees than with sales by domestic franchisees 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal excluding the rd week  general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal reflects an increase in share based compensation of  share based compensation in fiscal included a charge of  to correct prior years errors as described below 
exclusive of the effects of the error correction  share based compensation expense rose approximately  most of which was the result of an executive officer achieving retirement eligibility under the terms of the company s stock compensation plan in the first quarter of fiscal share based payment awards to retirement eligible persons are charged to expense over the period from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility rather than being amortized over the four year vesting period of the awards  which has the effect of accelerating the recognition of the expense associated with awards to such persons as they approach retirement eligibility 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal also reflect approximately million of expenses associated with the selection of a new enterprise resource planning system  professional fees associated with the implementation of the tax asset protection plan  and a provision related to the settlement of certain nuisance litigation 
general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal reflect a reversal of approximately  of remaining accruals for pledges to certain nonprofit organizations made in fiscal through which the company determined for various reasons would not be honored 
such amount was largely offset by one time costs associated with hiring a new executive officer  as well as by a charge of  to correct accounting computational errors related to share based compensation arising in prior periods of which  arose in earlier quarters of fiscal and the balance in fiscal through 
except for the quantitative effect of the correction of the errors on the fourth quarter of fiscal  the share based compensation errors were neither quantitatively nor qualitatively material to the results of any period  accordingly  the errors were corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal and prior financial statements were not restated 
the company is seeking to minimize general and administrative expenses in order to gain operating leverage as its revenues rise 
impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the components of these charges are set forth in the following table year ended february  january  in thousands impairment of long lived assets lease termination costs impairment charges relate to the company stores segment 
the company tests long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these events and changes in circumstances include store closing and refranchising decisions  the effects of changing costs on current results of operations  observed trends in operating results  and evidence of changed circumstances observed as a part of periodic reforecasts of future operating results and as part of the company s annual budgeting process 
impairment charges generally relate to stores expected to be closed or refranchised  as well as to stores management believes will not generate sufficient future cash flows to enable the company to recover the carrying value of the stores assets  but which management has not yet decided to close 
when the company concludes that the carrying value of long lived assets is not recoverable based on future projected undiscounted cash flows  the company records impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of those assets to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of these assets are estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  on independent appraisals and  in the case of assets the company is negotiating to sell  based on the company s negotiations with unrelated third party buyers 
lease termination costs represent the estimated fair value of liabilities related to unexpired leases  after reduction by the amount of accrued rent expense  if any  related to the leases  and are recorded when the lease contracts are terminated or  if earlier  the date on which the company ceases use of the leased property 
the fair value of these liabilities were estimated as the excess  if any  of the contractual payments required under the unexpired leases over the current market lease rates for the properties  discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate over the remaining term of the leases 
the provision for lease termination costs also includes adjustments to liabilities recorded in prior periods arising from changes in estimated sublease rentals and from settlements with landlords 
in fiscal and  the company recorded lease termination charges of  and  respectively  principally reflecting a change in estimated sublease rentals and settlements with landlords on stores previously closed 
the company intends to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeastern united states 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has refranchised a total of stores and received consideration totaling million in connection with those transactions 
during this period  the company recorded impairment charges totaling approximately  related to completed and anticipated refranchisings 
on february   the company refranchised three stores in the kansas missouri market  the company closed a fourth store in the market in january in anticipation of the transaction 
the four stores had total sales of approximately million in fiscal the company does not anticipate recording any significant gain or loss on the refranchising transaction 
the company cannot predict the likelihood of refranchising any additional stores or markets or the amount of proceeds  if any  which might be received therefrom  including the amounts which might be realized from the sale of store assets and the execution of any related franchise agreements 
refranchising could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses on the related assets 
interest expense the components of interest expense are as follows year ended february  january  in thousands interest accruing on outstanding term loan indebtedness letter of credit and unused revolver fees amortization of cost of interest rate derivative amortization of deferred financing costs other the decrease in interest accruing on outstanding indebtedness and in letter of credit and unused revolver fees reflects the reduction in the principal outstanding under the company s term loan and a reduction in the lender s interest margin due to a decrease in the company s leverage ratio 
equity in income losses of equity method franchisees the company recorded equity in the losses of equity method franchisees of  in fiscal compared to losses of  in fiscal this caption represents the company s share of operating results of equity method franchisees which develop and operate krispy kreme stores 
on may   the company sold its equity interest in kk mexico  the company s franchisee in mexico  to kk mexico s majority shareholder as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company s equity in earnings of kk mexico was approximately  for the fiscal year ended gain on sale of interest in equity method franchisee in fiscal  the company realized a gain of approximately million from the sale of the company s investment in kk mexico  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the after tax proceeds of the sale of approximately million were used to prepay a portion of the company s term loan 
other non operating income and expense  net other non operating income and expense in fiscal and fiscal includes credits of  and  respectively  representing reductions in recorded liabilities for franchisee guarantee obligations resulting from decreases in the guaranteed amounts 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal and a credit of million in fiscal the fiscal amount includes a credit of million per diluted share from the reversal of a portion of a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in accordance with gaap  which provides that such valuation allowances shall be established unless realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
from fiscal until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company maintained a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets equal to the entire excess of those assets over the company s deferred tax liabilities because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets 
such uncertainty arose principally from the substantial losses incurred by the company from fiscal though fiscal realization of net deferred tax assets generally is dependent on generation of taxable income in future periods 
the company reported a pretax profit of  in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the company s pretax profit increased to million  inclusive of a million non recurring gain on the company s sale of its equity interest in kk mexico 
after considering all relevant factors having an impact on the likelihood of future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  in the fourth quarter of fiscal management concluded that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of the company s deferred tax assets would be realized in future years 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  with an offsetting credit to the provision for income taxes  representing the amount of deferred tax assets management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
while the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance increased the company s earnings by million in fiscal  the reversal has the effect of reducing the company s earnings beginning in fiscal as a result of an increase in the provision for income taxes 
this negative effect on earnings occurs because the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition in fiscal of income tax benefits expected to be realized in later years 
absent the reversal of the valuation allowance  any such tax benefits would have been recognized when realized in future periods upon the generation of taxable income 
accordingly  beginning in fiscal  the company s effective income tax rate  which in fiscal and earlier years bore little or no relationship to pretax income  more closely reflects the blended federal and state income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates 
because of the increase in the company s effective income tax rate as described above  the company s income tax expense in fiscal is not comparable to income tax expense in fiscal in addition  until such time as the company s net operating loss carryforwards are exhausted or expire  gaap income tax expense is expected to substantially exceed the amount of cash income taxes payable by the company  which are expected to remain insignificant 
in addition to adjustments to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  the provision for income taxes includes amounts estimated to be payable or refundable currently 
the portion of the income tax provision representing taxes estimated to be payable currently was approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  the majority of which represents foreign withholding taxes related to royalties and franchise fees paid by international franchisees 
in addition  the fiscal amount includes approximately million of foreign income taxes arising from the gain on the sale of the company s interest in kk mexico 
see matters affecting comparability  above  for disclosures intended to compare the company s results of operations for fiscal and exclusive of the effects of the reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the gain on the sale of the company s interest in kk mexico and related taxes thereon 
net income the company reported net income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the fiscal net income includes a credit of million from the reversal of a portion of a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets and an after tax gain of million on the company s sale of its interest in kk mexico 
see matters affecting comparability above 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion of the company s results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
matters affecting comparability the company s provision for income taxes  net income and earnings per share for fiscal are not comparable to the corresponding amounts for fiscal as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards and  accordingly  the company s cash payments for income taxes  which were not affected by the reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  are expected to remain insignificant for the foreseeable future 
see results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes below  and note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a gain of approximately million on the sale of its equity interest in kk mexico approximately million after deduction of approximately million of mexican taxes payable on the transaction  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
such gains should not be expected to occur regularly 
management evaluates the company s results of operations using  among other measures  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share  which include the provision for income taxes only to the extent such taxes are currently payable in cash 
in addition  management excludes from adjusted net income charges and credits that are unusual and infrequently occurring 
management believes adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are useful performance measures because they more closely measure the cash flows generated by the company s operations and the trends in those cash flows than do gaap net income and earnings per share  and because they exclude the effects of transactions that are not indicative of the company s ongoing results of operations 
adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non gaap measures 
the following presentation of adjusted net income  and the related reconciliation of adjusted net income to gaap net income and presentation of adjusted earnings per share  are intended to assist the reader in understanding the effects of the reversal of the valuation allowance and the non recurring gain on the sale of the interest in kk mexico on the company s results of operations for fiscal  facilitate comparisons of fiscal results with the company s results for fiscal  and illustrate the material difference between the company s income tax expense and income taxes currently payable 
these non gaap performance measures are consistent with other measurements made by management in the operation of the business which do not consider income taxes except to the extent to which those taxes currently are payable  for example  capital allocation decisions and incentive compensation measurements that are made on a pretax basis

a reconciliation of company stores segment sales from fiscal to fiscal follows on premises wholesale total in thousands sales for the year ended january   fiscal sales at closed stores increase in sales at established stores open stores only   increase in sales at stores opened in fiscal   sales at stores opened in fiscal   sales for the year ended january     sales at company stores increased in fiscal from fiscal due to an increase in sales from existing stores and stores opened in fiscal and fiscal selling price increases in the on premises and wholesale distribution channels accounted for approximately percentage points of the increase in sales  exclusive of the effects of higher pricing on unit volumes  such effects are difficult to measure reliably 
as with all consumer products  however  higher prices may negatively affect sales 
the company believes this phenomenon is more pronounced in the wholesale channel where competing products are merchandised alongside those of the company 
year ended january  january  on premises change in same store sales change in same store customer count retail sales only average guest check retail sales only wholesale grocers mass merchants change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door convenience stores change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door on premises sales the components of the change in same store sales at company stores are as follows year ended january  january  change in same store sales attributable to retail pricing guest check average exclusive of the effects of pricing customer count other total on premises sales on premises sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal on march   the company implemented price increases at substantially all its stores designed to help offset the rising costs of doughnut mixes  other ingredients and fuel resulting from higher commodity prices 
the price increases  which affected approximately of on premises sales  averaged approximately 
these price increases were not fully reflected in the same store sales metrics because they were in effect for only of the weeks in fiscal additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company raised its fundraising prices approximately 
wholesale distribution sales to wholesale accounts increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately percentage points of the sales increase reflects price increases  including not only increases implemented in the first quarter of fiscal but also price increases implemented in fiscal the company believes the wholesale sales increase was greater than that of the doughnut industry as a whole 
the company started implementing price increases for some products offered in the wholesale channel mid april  and substantially completed implementing the increases during the second quarter 
those price increases affected products comprising approximately of wholesale sales  and the average price increase on those products was approximately 
sales to grocers and mass merchants increased to million  with a increase in average weekly sales per door and a increase in the average number of doors served 
in addition to pricing  the company believes that average weekly sales per door in the grocer mass merchant channel have grown as a result of  among other things  improved customer service  introduction of additional price points  a redesign of product packaging to improve its shelf appeal and the addition of new relatively higher volume doors 
convenience store sales increased to million  reflecting a increase in the average weekly sales per door  partially offset by a decline in the average number of doors served 
the decline in the average weekly number of doors in the convenience store channel in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally the result of the company s efforts to improve route management and route consolidation including the elimination of and reduction in the number of stops at relatively low volume doors 
costs and expenses total cost of sales as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage points from in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal as a result of rising costs of doughnut mixes and other ingredients resulting from higher commodity prices  the company implemented selling price increases designed to help offset the increased costs 
before considering the potential loss of unit volume as a result of on premises and wholesale selling price increases  those price increases more than offset higher costs of food  beverages and packaging in fiscal the effects of price increases on unit volumes are difficult to measure reliably 
the combined effects of higher selling prices and increased input costs accounted for substantially all of the increase in the cost of food  beverage and packaging as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to last year 
exclusive of the effects of pricing and input costs  food  beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of revenues were flat 
shop labor as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage points from fiscal to of revenues in fiscal  principally due to higher sales resulting from price increases 
vehicle costs as a percentage of revenues increased from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal  principally as a result of higher fuel costs and higher expense of leased delivery trucks in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense in the fiscal as a result of the company replacing a portion of its aging delivery fleet 
the company is self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability claims  but maintains stop loss coverage for individual claims exceeding certain amounts 
the company provides for claims under these self insured programs using actuarial methods as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and updates actuarial valuations of its self insurance reserves at least annually 
such periodic actuarial valuations result in changes over time in the estimated amounts which ultimately will be paid for claims under these programs to reflect the company s actual claims experience for each policy year as well as trends in claims experience over multiple years 
such claims  particularly workers compensation claims  often are paid over a number of years following the year in which the insured events occur  and the estimated ultimate cost of each year s claims accordingly is adjusted over time as additional information becomes available 
the company recorded favorable adjustments to its self insurance claims liabilities related to prior years of approximately million in fiscal  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter  and million in  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
of the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal  million relates to workers compensation liability claims and is included in employee benefits in the table above   relates to vehicle liability claims and is included in vehicle costs in the table above and  relates to general liability claims and is included in other operating expenses in the table above 
of the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal  million relates to workers compensation liability claims   relates to vehicle liability claims and  relates to general liability claims 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage point from fiscal to of revenues in fiscal reflecting  among other things  lower store level marketing expense 
other segment operating costs as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage points from the fiscal to of revenues in fiscal reflecting  among other things  a decrease in spending on wholesale selling and support expenses 
domestic franchise year ended january  january  in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees other total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead total operating expenses   segment operating income   domestic franchise revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase reflects higher domestic royalty revenues resulting from an increase in sales by domestic franchise stores from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal domestic franchise same store sales rose fiscal domestic franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new domestic franchisees  to assist in domestic store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of domestic franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
the increase in domestic franchise operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a provision of  recorded in the second quarter of fiscal for payments under a lease guarantee associated with a franchisee whose franchise agreements the company terminated during the second quarter  as well as an increase in franchisee support costs 
the increase also reflects an increase in bad debt expense as a result of a credit of  reflected in fiscal  resulting principally from recoveries of receivables previously written off 
these increases were partially offset by the reversal of a previously recorded accrual of  related to a franchisee lease guarantee as a result of the company receiving a release from the related guarantee during the third quarter of fiscal in addition  operating expenses reflected a decrease in legal fees of  in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company incurred unusually high legal costs related to the company s termination of the franchise agreements of one of its domestic franchisees 
domestic franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal of the closures  were operated by a franchisee whose franchise rights the company terminated in the second quarter of fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
international franchise year ended january  january  in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees   total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead   total operating expenses   segment operating income   international franchise royalties increased  driven by an increase in sales by international franchise stores from million in fiscal to million in fiscal changes in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business increased sales by international franchisees measured in us dollars by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  which positively affected international royalty revenues by approximately  in fiscal in fiscal  the company recognized  of royalty revenue from the company s mexican franchisee discussed in the second succeeding paragraph below 
the company did not recognize as revenue approximately million of uncollected royalties which accrued during fiscal because the company did not believe collection of these royalties was reasonably assured 
substantially all of the unrecognized royalties in fiscal related to the company s australian franchisee  which commenced a voluntary administration process similar to a bankruptcy filing in the us in october and november in connection with that process  in november  the franchisee closed of the shops the franchisee operated prior to the reorganization 
international development and franchise fees decreased  in fiscal  primarily as a result of a decline in the number of store openings from in fiscal to in fiscal this reduction in fees was partially offset by the recognition of approximately  of franchise fees related to the company s mexican franchisee described in the following paragraph 
royalties and franchise fees in fiscal include approximately  and  respectively  of amounts relating to the company s franchisee in mexico which accrued in prior periods but which had not previously been reported as revenue because of uncertainty surrounding their collection 
such amounts were reported as revenue in recognition of the payment of such amounts to the company on may   in connection with the company s sale of its equity interest in the franchisee  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
international franchise same store sales  measured on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of changing exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar constant dollar same store sales  fell 
the decline in international franchise same store sales reflects  among other things  waning honeymoon effects from the large number of new stores opened internationally in recent years and the cannibalization effects on initial stores in new markets of additional store openings in those markets 
honeymoon effect means the common pattern for many start up restaurants in which a flurry of activity due to start up publicity and natural curiosity is followed by a decline during which a steady repeat customer base develops 
cannibalization effect means the tendency for new stores to become successful  in part or in whole  by shifting sales from existing stores in the same market 
constant dollar same store sales in established markets fell in fiscal and fell in new markets 
established markets means countries in which the first krispy kreme store opened before fiscal sales at stores in established markets comprised approximately of aggregate constant dollar same store sales 
international franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new international franchisees  to assist in international store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of international franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
international franchise operating expenses rose in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of personnel additions  including benefits and travel costs  and other cost increases resulting from the company s decision to devote additional resources to the development and support of international franchisees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense to a net credit of  in fiscal compared to a net credit of  in fiscal the credit recorded to the bad debt provision in fiscal related principally to the mexican franchisee discussed above 
a net credit in bad debt expense should not be expected to recur frequently 
international franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
kk supply chain the components of kk supply chain revenues and expenses expressed in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination are set forth in the table below percentage amounts may not add to totals due to rounding 
percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination year ended year ended january  january  january  january  in thousands revenues doughnut mixes   other ingredients  packaging and supplies   equipment   fuel surcharge  total revenues before intersegment sales elimination operating expenses cost of sales cost of goods produced and purchased   gain loss on agricultural derivatives inbound freight   total cost of sales   distribution costs   other segment operating costs   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead   total operating costs   segment operating income   kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales eliminations increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase reflects selling price increases for doughnut mixes  sugar  shortening and certain other ingredients instituted by kk supply chain in order to pass along to company and franchise stores increases in kk supply chain s cost of sugar  flour and shortening 
the unit volumes in most product categories were generally flat in fiscal compared to fiscal the company utilizes a fuel surcharge program to recoup additional freight costs resulting from increases in fuel costs 
charges under the program are based upon the price of diesel fuel 
the increase in fuel surcharges compared to fiscal reflects the rising cost of diesel fuel  prices for which were higher relative to the surcharge benchmark in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in cost of goods produced and purchased as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects  among other things  an increase in the cost of agricultural commodities used in the production of doughnut mix and of other goods sold to company and franchise stores 
in particular  the prices of flour  shortening and sugar and the products from which they are made were significantly higher in fiscal compared fiscal kk supply chain increased the prices charged to company and franchise stores for doughnut mixes  shortening  sugar and other goods in order to mitigate increases in the cost of raw materials 
however  kk supply chain margins were adversely affected because  while the company increased prices to cover higher costs  the company did not raise prices to earn a proportionate gross profit on all of its higher costs 
distribution costs rose in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of duplicate facility costs and other conversion expenses associated with the transition of product distribution for stores east of the mississippi to an outsourced provider which began in june  however  distribution costs as a percentage of total revenues fell in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to higher sales resulting from price increases 
other segment operating costs include segment management  purchasing  customer service and support  laboratory and quality control costs  and research and development expenses 
these costs include a net credit in bad debt expense of approximately  in fiscal compared to a charge of  in fiscal the net credit in fiscal principally reflected sustained improved payment performance and reduced credit exposure with respect to a small number of franchisees 
a net credit in bad debt expense should not be expected to recur frequently 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal a substantial portion of kk supply chain s revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
an increasing percentage of franchise store sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
while the company sells doughnut mixes and concentrates to its international franchisees  these franchisees purchase substantially all other ingredients  packaging and supplies from local or regional vendors approved by the company 
accordingly  kk supply chain revenues are less correlated with sales by international franchisees than with sales by domestic franchisees 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal reflect a reversal of approximately  of remaining accruals for pledges to certain nonprofit organizations made in fiscal through which the company determined for various reasons would not be honored 
such amount was largely offset by one time costs associated with hiring a new executive officer  as well as by a charge of  to correct accounting computational errors related to share based compensation arising in prior periods of which  arose in earlier quarters of fiscal and the balance in fiscal through 
except for the quantitative effect of the correction of the errors on the fourth quarter of fiscal  the share based compensation errors were neither quantitatively nor qualitatively material to the results of any period  accordingly  the errors were corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal and prior financial statements were not restated 
impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the components of these charges are set forth in the following table year ended january  january  in thousands impairment charges impairment of long lived assets current period charges impairment of long lived assets adjustments to previously recorded estimates impairment of reacquired franchise rights total impairment charges  lease termination costs impairment charges relate to the company stores segment 
the company tests long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these events and changes in circumstances include store closing and refranchising decisions  the effects of changing costs on current results of operations  observed trends in operating results  and evidence of changed circumstances observed as a part of periodic reforecasts of future operating results and as part of the company s annual budgeting process 
impairment charges generally relate to stores expected to be closed or refranchised  as well as to stores management believes will not generate sufficient future cash flows to enable the company to recover the carrying value of the stores assets  but which management has not yet decided to close 
when the company concludes that the carrying value of long lived assets is not recoverable based on future projected undiscounted cash flows  the company records impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of those assets to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of these assets are estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  on independent appraisals and  in the case of assets the company is negotiating to sell  based on the company s negotiations with unrelated third party buyers 
lease termination costs represent the estimated fair value of liabilities related to unexpired leases  after reduction by the amount of accrued rent expense  if any  related to the leases  and are recorded when the lease contracts are terminated or  if earlier  the date on which the company ceases use of the leased property 
the fair value of these liabilities were estimated as the excess  if any  of the contractual payments required under the unexpired leases over the current market lease rates for the properties  discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate over the remaining term of the leases 
in fiscal  the company recorded lease termination charges of  principally reflecting a change in estimated sublease rentals and settlements with landlords on stores previously closed 
in fiscal  the company recorded lease termination charges of  representing a change in estimated sublease rentals on stores previously closed and charges related to two store closures and a store relocation  partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accrued rent related to those stores 
the company intends to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeastern united states 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has refranchised a total of stores and received consideration totaling million in connection with those transactions 
during this period  the company recorded impairment charges totaling approximately  related to completed and anticipated refranchisings 
interest expense the components of interest expense are as follows year ended january  january  in thousands interest accruing on outstanding indebtedness  letter of credit and unused revolver fees  amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate derivatives other the decrease in interest accruing on outstanding term loan indebtedness and in letter of credit and unused revolver fees reflects the substantial reduction in lender margin on the company s credit facilities resulting from the refinancing of those facilities in january  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  as well as the reduction in the principal outstanding under the company s term loan 
the interest rate derivative contracts which gave rise to the amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate derivatives in fiscal expired in april loss on refinancing of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company closed the secured credit facilities described below under liquidity and capital resources cash flows from financing activities and used the proceeds to retire other indebtedness  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company recorded a loss on the refinancing of approximately million  consisting of an  write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the retired debt and  related to other expenses 
equity in income losses of equity method franchisees the company recorded equity in the losses of equity method franchisees of  in fiscal compared to earnings of  in fiscal this caption represents the company s share of operating results of equity method franchisees which develop and operate krispy kreme stores

the company s equity in earnings of kk mexico was approximately  and  for the fiscal year ended and  respectively 
gain on sale of interest in equity method franchisee in fiscal  the company realized a gain of approximately million from the sale of the company s investment in kk mexico  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the after tax proceeds of the sale of approximately million were used to prepay a portion of the company s term loan 
other non operating income and expense  net other non operating income and expense in fiscal and fiscal includes credits of  and  respectively  representing reductions in recorded liabilities for franchisee guarantee obligations resulting from decreases in the guaranteed amounts 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was a credit of million in fiscal and a charge of million in fiscal the fiscal amount includes a credit of million per diluted share from the reversal of a portion of a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in accordance with gaap  which provides that such valuation allowances shall be established unless realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
from fiscal until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company maintained a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets equal to the entire excess of those assets over the company s deferred tax liabilities because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets 
such uncertainty arose principally from the substantial losses incurred by the company from fiscal though fiscal realization of net deferred tax assets generally is dependent on generation of taxable income in future periods 
the company reported a pretax profit of  in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the company s pretax profit increased to million  inclusive of a million non recurring gain on the company s sale of its equity interest in kk mexico 
after considering all relevant factors having an impact on the likelihood of future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  in the fourth quarter of fiscal management concluded that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of the company s deferred tax assets would be realized in future years 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  with an offsetting credit to the provision for income taxes  representing the amount of deferred tax assets management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
while the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance increased the company s earnings by million in fiscal  the reversal has the effect of reducing the company s earnings beginning in fiscal as a result of an increase in the provision for income taxes in such years 
this negative effect on earnings occurs because the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition in fiscal of income tax benefits expected to be realized in later years 
absent the reversal of the valuation allowance  any such tax benefits would have been recognized when realized in future periods upon the generation of taxable income 
accordingly  beginning in fiscal  the company s effective income tax rate  which in fiscal and earlier years bore little or no relationship to pretax income  more closely reflects the blended federal and state income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates 
because of the increase in the company s effective income tax rate as described above  the company s income tax expense in fiscal is not comparable to income tax expense in fiscal and earlier years 
in addition  until such time as the company s net operating loss carryforwards are exhausted or expire  gaap income tax expense is expected to substantially exceed the amount of cash income taxes payable by the company  which are expected to remain insignificant 
in addition to adjustments to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  the provision for income taxes includes amounts estimated to be payable or refundable currently 
the portion of the income tax provision representing taxes estimated to be payable currently was approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  the majority of which represents foreign withholding taxes related to royalties and franchise fees paid by international franchisees 
in addition  the fiscal amount includes approximately million of foreign income taxes arising from the gain on the sale of the company s interest in kk mexico

in january  the company entered into the secured credit facilities as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
those facilities consist of the million term loan and the million revolver 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to retire the approximately million outstanding term loan balance under the company s prior secured credit facilities  which were terminated 
the company paid approximately million in fees and expenses in connection with the secured credit facilities  of which approximately million was capitalized as deferred financing costs and the balance of approximately  was charged to expense and is included in loss on refinancing of debt in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  the company repaid million of outstanding term loan and capitalized lease indebtedness prior to the refinancing  consisting of approximately  of scheduled principal amortization  million of prepayments from the sale of a closed store  and a discretionary prepayment of million 
during fiscal  pursuant to an authorization of the company s board of directors  and with the approval of its lenders  the company repurchased in open market transactions approximately  shares of its common stock for million  an average price of per share 
the company s board of directors may authorize additional share repurchases or other transactions involving the direct or indirect distribution of cash to the company s shareholders  but the company currently does not contemplate instituting a regular cash dividend 
the company s secured credit facilities impose significant limitations on redemptions of the company s shares and cash distributions to shareholders and  accordingly  approval of the company s lenders would be required prior to implementing any such transaction 
capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to cash generated from operations  the company utilizes other capital resources and financing arrangements to fund its business 
a discussion of these capital resources and financing techniques is included below 
debt the company continuously monitors its funding requirements for general working capital purposes and other financing and investing activities 
in the last three fiscal years  management focused on reducing or eliminating the company s investments in franchisees and the related guarantees of franchisees obligations  reducing outstanding debt  and on restructuring the company s borrowing arrangements to maintain credit availability and lower financing costs to facilitate accomplishing the company s business restructuring and expansion initiatives 
the secured credit facilities described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein are the company s principal source of external financing 
the secured credit facilities contain significant financial covenants 
based on the company s current working capital and the fiscal operating plan  management believes the company can comply with the financial covenants and that the company can meet its projected operating  investing and financing cash requirements 
the operation of the financial covenants described above could limit the amount the company may borrow under the revolver 
in addition  the maximum amount which may be borrowed under the revolver is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit  which totaled approximately million as of february   all of which secure the company s reimbursement obligations to insurers under the company s self insurance arrangements 
the unused borrowing capacity available to the company as of february  was approximately million 
the restrictive covenants did not limit the company s ability to borrow the full million of unused credit under the revolver at that date 
the secured credit facilities also contain customary events of default including  without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to other indebtedness in excess of million  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  judgment defaults in excess of million and the occurrence of a change of control 
leases the company conducts some of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment 
generally  these leases have initial terms of two to years and contain provisions for renewal options of five to years 
in determining whether to enter into a lease for an asset  the company evaluates the nature of the asset and the associated lease terms to determine if leasing is an effective financing tool 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of sec regulation s k  consist principally of the company s guarantees of indebtedness of certain franchisees  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
contractual cash obligations at february  the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  are as follows payments due in less than more than total amount year years years years in thousands long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities   interest payment obligations   capital lease obligations   capital lease interest obligations   operating lease obligations      purchase obligations     contingent guarantee obligations   other long term obligations  including current portion  reflected on the company s balance sheet self insurance claims  principally worker compensation      k mirror plan liability   total     estimated interest payments for variable rate debt are based upon the libor interest rate as of february  amounts represent of the company s aggregate exposure at february  under loan guarantees related to franchisees in which the company has an ownership interest 
the timing of the potential payment is based upon the maturity of the guaranteed indebtedness 
no demand has been made on the company to perform under any of the guarantees 
the preceding table of contractual cash obligations excludes income tax liabilities of approximately million as of february  for uncertain tax positions due to uncertainty in predicting the timing of any such related payments 
capital and liquidity requirements in the next five years  the company plans to use cash primarily for the following activities working capital and other general corporate purposes  opening new company stores  principally small retail shops  in selected markets  remodeling  replacement and relocation of selected older company shops  routine capital expenditures to maintain the appearance and functionality of the company s facilities and equipment  including its wholesale commissaries and retail krispy kreme shops  maintaining and enhancing the kk supply chain manufacturing and distribution capabilities  and investing in information technology 
the company s capital requirements for these activities may be significant 
the amount of these capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the company s overall performance  the pace of store expansion  securing desirable real estate for new stores  the number of store remodels  and other infrastructure needs 
the company currently estimates that its capital expenditures for fiscal will be in the range of million to million 
the most significant capital expenditures currently planned for fiscal are from seven to ten new stores  refurbishments and replacement of existing stores  new point of sale software to replace existing software that is approaching the end of its useful life  initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning system and enhancements to and replacements of existing information technology systems  and ongoing smaller  routine capital expenditures 
the company plans to fund these expenditures principally using cash provided by operations and current cash resources  although the company may choose to lease certain anticipated asset acquisitions 
the company believes that its current cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations and the liquidity afforded by the revolver are sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation the company does not believe that general price inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  prices of agricultural commodities and fuel have been volatile in recent years 
those price changes  which have generally trended upward  have had a significant effect on the cost of flour  shortening and sugar  the three most significant ingredients used in the production of the company s products  as well as on the cost of gasoline consumed by the company s wholesale delivery fleet 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures  including disclosures of contingencies and uncertainties 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of changes in facts and circumstances and discusses the selection of accounting policies and significant accounting judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that application of the following accounting policies involves judgments and estimates that are among the more significant used in the preparation of the financial statements  and that an understanding of these policies is important to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties earned on sales by the company s franchisees  sales by kk supply chain to our franchisees of equipment  mix and other supplies necessary to operate a krispy kreme store  as well as from wholesale sales by company stores to convenience and grocery stores and other customers 
the company has recorded provisions for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable  including receivables from franchisees  in amounts which management believes are sufficient to provide for losses estimated to be sustained on realization of these receivables 
such estimates inherently involve uncertainties and assessments of the outcome of future events  and changes in facts and circumstances may result in adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts 
goodwill the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance related to goodwill addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill subsequent to its acquisition 
this guidance provides that goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate potential impairment 
the company performs the annual test for goodwill impairment as of december the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets like goodwill involves comparing the fair value of such assets with their carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value recorded as an impairment charge 
the goodwill impairment test involves determining the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and comparing those fair values to the reporting units carrying values  including goodwill 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units forecasting future revenues  expenses and any capital spending to derive future reporting unit cash flows  then discounts those cash flows to present value 
the company also considers the estimated fair values of its reporting units relative to the company s overall market capitalization in connection with its goodwill impairment assessment 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair values of reporting units 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  operating results and the balances of goodwill could be affected by impairment charges 
there were no goodwill impairment charges in fiscal  or as of february   the remaining goodwill had a carrying value of million  of which million and million was associated with the domestic and international franchise segments  respectively  each of which consists of a single reporting unit 
the risk of goodwill impairment would increase in the event that the franchise segments operating results were to significantly deteriorate or the overall market capitalization of the company were to decline below the book value of the company s shareholders equity 
in september  the fasb amended the guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
the amended guidance will permit  but does not require  companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
companies may elect to apply the new guidance in some periods and not in others  and to some reporting units and not to others 
the company adopted the amended guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal such adoption had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asset impairment when an asset group typically a store is identified as underperforming or when a decision is made to abandon an asset group or to close a store  the company makes an assessment of the potential impairment of the related assets 
the assessment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets  primarily property and equipment  to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from those assets 
to estimate cash flows  management projects the net cash flows anticipated from continuing operation of the asset group or store until its closing or abandonment  as well as cash flows  if any  anticipated from disposal of the related assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their estimated fair value 
determining undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of an asset group involves estimating future cash flows  revenues  operating expenses and disposal values 
the projections of these amounts represent management s best estimates at the time of the review 
if different cash flows had been estimated  property and equipment balances and related impairment charges could have been affected 
further  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results could be affected 
in addition  the sale of assets whose carrying value has been reduced by impairment charges could result in the recognition of gains or losses to the extent the sales proceeds realized differ from the reduced carrying amount of the assets 
the company recorded no impairment charges in fiscal in fiscal and  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets totaling approximately  and million  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
insurance the company is subject to workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims 
the company is self insured for the cost of all workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims up to the amount of stop loss insurance coverage purchased by the company from commercial insurance carriers 
the company maintains accruals for the estimated cost of claims on an undiscounted basis  without regard to the effects of stop loss coverage  using actuarial methods which evaluate known open and incurred but not reported claims and consider historical loss development experience 
in addition  the company records receivables from the insurance carriers for claims amounts estimated to be recovered under the stop loss insurance policies when these amounts are estimable and probable of collection 
the company estimates such stop loss receivables using the same actuarial methods used to establish the related claims accruals  and taking into account the amount of risk transferred to the carriers under the stop loss policies 
many estimates and assumptions are involved in estimating future claims  and differences between future events and prior estimates and assumptions could affect future operating results and result in adjustments to these loss accruals and related insurance receivables 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon management s expectation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred  or expenses which have been deducted in the company s tax returns but which have not yet been recognized as an expense in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent tax deductions or credits that will be reflected in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements 
the company had valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets of million and million at february  and january   respectively  representing the portion of such deferred tax assets which  as of such dates  management estimated would not be realized 
under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  future realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated under a more likely than not standard 
realization of net deferred tax assets generally is dependent on generation of taxable income in future periods 
from fiscal until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company maintained a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets equal to the entire excess of those assets over the company s deferred income tax liabilities because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets 
such uncertainty arose principally from the substantial losses incurred by the company from fiscal though fiscal the company reported a pretax profit of  in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the company s pretax profit increased to million  inclusive of a million non recurring gain from the company s sale of its interest in kk mexico 
after considering all relevant factors having an impact on the likelihood of future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  in the fourth quarter of fiscal management concluded that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of the company s deferred tax assets would be realized in future years and  in accordance with gaap  reversed million of the valuation allowance  with an offsetting credit to the provision for income taxes 
two of the most significant factors considered by management in reaching its conclusion were that the company earned a significant pretax profit in both fiscal and and the positive trend in the company s earnings 
in fiscal  the company s pretax income rose to million 
the evaluation of the amount of net deferred tax assets expected to be realized necessarily involves forecasting the amount of taxable income that will be generated in future years 
in addition  because a substantial portion of the company s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration  the specific future periods in which taxable income is generated may have a material effect on the amount of deferred tax assets that ultimately are realized 
the company has forecasted future results using estimates management believes to be reasonable and which are based on objective verifiable evidence 
the most important factor considered by management in making its forecast was the company s results of operations for fiscal  and assuming the company generates pretax income in each future year approximating the company s average pretax income over the past three years  management estimates that approximately million of its deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
the decrease in the amount of deferred income tax assets expected to be realized from january  to february  reflects the realization in fiscal of approximately million of such assets and the loss of approximately million of income tax benefits associated with the expiration in fiscal of warrants to acquire the company s common stock issued in prior years  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the remaining valuation allowance of million as of february  represents the portion of the company s deferred tax assets management estimates will not be realized in the future 
such assets are associated principally with state net operating loss carryforwards having relatively short carryover periods which are forecasted to expire unused  as well as federal foreign tax credits and federal jobs credit carryforwards forecasted to expire unused 
the realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on future events 
while management believes its forecast of future taxable income is reasonable  actual results inevitably will vary from management s forecasts 
such variances could result in adjustments to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in future periods  and such adjustments could be material to the financial statements 
as described above  in making its estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets which will be realized in future periods  the company estimated annual future pretax income of approximately million 
based on that estimate  the company concluded that a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million was appropriate as of february  a reduction in the amount of assumed future annual pretax income would have had no material effect on management s determination of the amount of deferred tax valuation allowance 
a reduction in the amount of assumed future annual pretax income would have caused management s determination of the appropriate valuation allowance to increase from million to approximately million 
if the company s earnings remain at current levels or continue to increase  it is reasonably likely that management would conclude that its estimate of annual income in future years should increase 
for example  if management concluded that a future annual earnings forecast of million  which approximates fiscal pretax income measured on a week basis  were appropriate  then the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance would be reduced by approximately million  with an offsetting credit to the provision for income taxes 
management believes that because estimates of future earnings are inherently subjective  and because such estimates necessarily involve forecasting many years into the future  frequent revisions to such estimates should not be expected 
while the company s results of operations continued to improve in fiscal and exceeded management s estimated annual pretax income for future years of million described above  the company believes that additional evidence is necessary before concluding that the level of pretax income achieved in fiscal is sustainable on a long term basis 
management believes that such evidence should include  among other things  at least one additional year of pretax profits substantially in excess of million before it would be appropriate for management to revised upward its estimate of future annual pretax income 
as a result  absent the occurrence of some event or events not currently known  management does not anticipate adjusting its estimate of future earnings until the end of fiscal  although management will revisit this assessment at the end of each quarter of the coming fiscal year 
while the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowances increased the company s earnings by million in fiscal  the reversal has the effect of increasing the provision for income taxes  and therefore decreasing net income  beginning in fiscal this negative effect on earnings occurs because the reversal of the valuation allowances resulted in the recognition in fiscal of income tax benefits expected to be realized in later years 
absent the reversal of the valuation allowances  such tax benefits would have been recognized when realized in future periods upon the generation of taxable income 
accordingly  beginning in fiscal  the company s effective income tax rate  which in fiscal and earlier years bore little or no relationship to pretax income  more closely reflects the blended federal and state income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates 
because of the increase in the company s effective income tax rate as described above  the company s income tax expense in fiscal is not comparable to income tax expense in prior years in addition  until such time as the company s net operating loss carryforwards are exhausted or expire  gaap income tax expense is expected to substantially exceed the amount of cash income taxes payable by the company  which are expected to remain insignificant for the foreseeable future 
guarantee liabilities the company has guaranteed a portion of certain loan obligations of certain franchisees in which the company owns an interest 
the company assesses the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantees and records estimated liabilities for anticipated payments when the company believes that an obligation to perform under the guarantees is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
no liabilities for the guarantees were recorded at the time they were issued because the company believed the value of the guarantees was immaterial 
as of february   the company has recorded liabilities of approximately million related to such loan guarantees 
the aggregate outstanding principal balance that was guaranteed by the company was approximately million at that date 
assessing the probability of future guarantee payments involves estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amounts estimated to be paid pursuant to such guarantees could change  and additional provisions to record such liabilities could be required 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share based payment awards based on their fair values 
because options granted to employees differ from options on the company s common shares traded in the financial markets  the company cannot determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on observed market prices 
accordingly  the company estimates the fair value of stock options subject only to service conditions using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires inputs including interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and employee exercise behavior patterns 
some of the inputs the company uses are not market observable and must be estimated 
in addition  the company must estimate the number of awards which ultimately will vest  and periodically adjusts such estimates to reflect actual vesting events 
use of different estimates and assumptions would produce different option values  which in turn would affect the amount of compensation expense recognized 
the black scholes model is capable of considering the specific features included in the options granted to the company s employees that are subject only to service conditions 
however  there are other models which could be used to estimate their fair value 
if the company were to use different models  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using different valuation models could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on its outstanding debt 
all of the borrowings under the company s secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon either the lenders prime rate  the fed funds rate or libor 
the interest cost of the company s debt may be affected by changes in these short term interest rates and increases in those rates may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
on march   the company entered into an interest rate derivative contract having an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
the derivative contract entitles the company to receive from the counterparty the excess  if any  of the three month libor rate over for each of the calendar quarters in the period beginning april and ending december the company is accounting for this derivative contract as a cash flow hedge 
as of february   the company had approximately million in borrowings outstanding 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in an approximately  increase in annual interest expense on the company s term debt 
the company has sought to limit its exposure to rising short term interest rates by entering into the derivative contract described above 
the company s credit facilities and the related interest rate derivative are described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
currency risk the substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
although royalties from international franchisees are payable to the company in us dollars  those royalties are computed based on local currency sales  and changes in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies used in the countries in which the international franchisees operate affect the company s royalty revenues 
because royalty revenues are derived from a relatively large number of foreign countries  and royalty revenues are not highly concentrated in a small number of such countries  the company believes that the relatively small size of any currency hedging activities would adversely affect the economics of hedging strategies and  accordingly  the company historically has not attempted to hedge these exchange rate risks 
in fiscal  the company s international franchisees had sales of approximately million  and the company s related royalty revenues were approximately million 
a hypothetical change in the average rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business would have a corresponding effect on the company s international royalty revenues of approximately million 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of ingredients of its products  of which flour  sugar and shortening are the most significant 
in order to secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients  the company routinely enters into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers 
under the forward purchase contracts  the company commits to purchasing agreed upon quantities of ingredients at agreed upon prices at specified future dates 
the outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from one month s to two years anticipated requirements  depending on the ingredient 
in addition to entering into forward purchase contracts  from time to time the company purchases exchange traded commodity futures contracts  and options on such contracts  for raw materials which are ingredients of its products or which are components of such ingredients  including wheat and soybean oil 
the company typically assigns the futures contract to a supplier in connection with entering into a forward purchase contract for the related ingredient 
the company operates a large fleet of delivery vehicles and is exposed to the effects of changes in gasoline prices 
the company periodically uses futures and options on futures to hedge a portion of its exposure to rising gasoline prices 
commodity derivatives outstanding at february  quantitative information about the company s unassigned option contracts and futures contracts and options on such contracts as of february   which mature in fiscal  is set forth in the table below 
weighted average contract aggregate price or strike contract price or aggregate fair contract volume price strike price value dollars in thousands  except average prices futures contracts wheat  bu 
 although the company utilizes forward purchase contracts and futures contracts and options on such contracts to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuations  such contracts do not fully mitigate price risk 
in addition  the portion of the company s anticipated future commodity requirements that are subject to such contracts vary from time to time 
adverse changes in commodity prices could materially adversely affect the company s profitability and liquidity 
sensitivity to price changes in commodities the following table illustrates the potential effect on the company s costs resulting from hypothetical changes in the cost of the company s three most significant ingredients and in the cost of gasoline used to fuel the company s delivery fleet

anticipated fiscal purchases of flour  shortening and sugar set forth in the preceding table represent aggregate estimated purchases by kk supply chain 
approximately of kk supply chain s fiscal sales were to company stores  with the remaining of sales made to domestic and international franchisees 
kk supply chain adjusts the selling prices of it products quarterly to reflect changes in its input costs 
to the extent kk supply chain adjusts selling prices to exactly offset changes in its input costs  the company  through its company stores segment  is directly exposed to only about half of such changes in kk supply chain input costs 
however  to the extent higher selling prices resulting from adverse movements in the cost of agricultural commodities adversely affect sales by company franchisees  the company s financial results could be indirectly adversely affected by lower kk supply chain sales to franchisees  as well as by lower royalty revenues 
the ranges of prices paid for fiscal set forth in the table above reflect the effects of any forward purchase contracts entered into at various times prior to delivery of the goods and  accordingly  do not necessarily reflect the ranges of prices of these ingredients prevailing in the market during the fiscal year 
the company has fixed the price of its anticipated sugar requirements for fiscal and accordingly  hypothetical effects of changes in the price of sugar have been omitted from the foregoing table 
as of march  the company has fixed the prices on approximately half of its anticipated fiscal requirements of flour and approximately of its anticipated fiscal requirements of shortening at prices not materially different from prices that prevailed in fiscal
