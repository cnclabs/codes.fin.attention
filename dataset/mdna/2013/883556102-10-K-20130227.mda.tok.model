overview of results of operations and liquidity the company develops  manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide 
the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
the company s continuing operations fall into three business segments see note analytical technologies  specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services 
the results of two businesses sold in april and a business sold in october  have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation 
the results discussed below refer to the company s continuing operations unless otherwise noted 
dollars in millions revenues analytical technologies specialty diagnostics laboratory products and services eliminations sales in were billion  an increase of million from the increase was due to acquisitions  including phadia and dionex  and higher sales at existing businesses  offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation 
had phadia  dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of  revenues would have increased million over pro forma revenues 
aside from the effects of currency translation and other acquisitions  net of divestitures  revenues in increased million over pro forma revenues discussed in total and by segment below 
the pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand 
demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of the company expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue in the near term due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the us and europe 
the company expects slowness in industrial markets will continue in the near term due to global economic uncertainty 
the company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in and the company s principal recent acquisitions are described below 
one lambda  a provider of transplant diagnostics  was acquired in september to enhance the company s presence in specialty in vitro diagnostics and add new capabilities to the company s transplant testing workflow

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity continued dionex  a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of ion and liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems  consumables  and software for chemical analysis  was acquired in may to expand the company s chromatography systems portfolio 
in  total company operating income and operating income margin were billion and  respectively  compared with billion and  respectively  in the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and  to a lesser extent  productivity improvements  net of inflationary cost increases and million of lower acquisition related charges in the increase was offset in part by commercial investments and an increase in amortization expense of million in  primarily related to the acquisitions of phadia and dionex 
the company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement ppi processes  reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities 
the company s effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
due primarily to the non deductibility of intangible asset amortization  the company s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the phadia acquisition 
the tax provision in was favorably affected by million  or percentage points  as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates  particularly a lower tax rate in sweden 
the tax provision in was unfavorably affected by million  or percentage points  as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates  offset in part by million  or percentage points  by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the phadia acquisition 
the company expects its effective tax rate in will be between and based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business 
the tax provision in will benefit from an estimated million of us tax credits for research and development activities in both and as a result of legislation enacted in january income from continuing operations increased to billion in  from billion in  primarily due to increased operating income and lower income taxes  offset in part by higher interest expense associated with debt to fund acquisitions 
during  the company s cash flow from operations totaled billion after deducting million used by discontinued operations  compared with billion including million from discontinued operations for the increase resulted primarily from higher income before amortization and depreciation in compared to as of december   the company s short term debt totaled million  including million of commercial paper obligations 
the company has revolving credit facilities with a bank group that provide up to billion of unsecured multi currency revolving credit 
the credit facilities include a billion year credit agreement  with the ability to request an additional million  plus a million day credit agreement 
if the company borrows under these facilities  it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under either facility  although available capacity was reduced by approximately million as a result of outstanding letters of credit 
the company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of million as of december   and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  business combinations  intangible assets and goodwill  equity investments  sales returns  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  pension costs and stock based compensation 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements a accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due 
such allowances totaled million at december  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
b inventories the company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding months  expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional writedowns may be required 
c intangible assets and goodwill the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
the determination of the fair value of intangible assets  which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions  requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i the fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized 
the company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
definite lived intangible assets totaled billion at december  the company reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 

financial statement index 
table of contents thermo fisher scientific inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled billion and billion  respectively  at december  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
growth at some of the company s businesses slowed in and which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets and economic uncertainty including a slow down in southern europe 
projections of profitability for and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of  the date of the company s impairment testing 
there can be no assurance  however  that the slowing of growth experienced in and at some businesses will not continue or worsen in and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary 
the company s immunodiagnostics reporting unit was created with the acquisition of the phadia group in august because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business  its book value equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date and thus  no cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date 
during its goodwill impairment testing  the company determined that the immunodiagnostics reporting unit s cushion of fair value over book value had increased from at the acquisition date to as of november  despite this favorable increase  given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value  relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill 
the key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions  as well as the weighted average cost of capital wacc rate applied 
the estimates used for these assumptions represent management best estimates  which the company believes are reasonable 
these assumptions  however  are subject to uncertainty  including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels 
the immunodiagnostics reporting unit had billion of goodwill  and had an overall carrying value of billion as of december  d other long lived assets the company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
other long lived assets totaled billion at december   including billion of fixed assets 
in testing a long lived asset for impairment  assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment 
should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts  charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued e revenues in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation  the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes 
the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation 
the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change  the company s revenue recognition would be affected 
in instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria  the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition 
if the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence  the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 
the company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services  or elements 
the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements 
in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post contract support is completed 
revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately 
revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed  based on vsoe  which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers 
should a greater or lesser number of products be returned  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 
f warranty obligations at the time the company recognizes revenue  it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns 
the liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled million at december  should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 
g income taxes in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
the company s reserve for these matters totaled million at december  where applicable  associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and  as a result  is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non us tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income 
the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  the company reverses the related valuation allowance 
any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision 
the company s tax valuation allowance totaled million at december  should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained  a reduction in the company s tax provision would result 
h contingencies and litigation the company records accruals for various contingencies  including legal proceedings  environmental  workers compensation  product  general and auto liabilities  and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
the accruals are based on management s judgment  historical claims experience  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates 
reserves of acquired businesses  including product liability and environmental reserves  were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value 
additionally  the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 
i pension and other retiree benefits several of the company s us and us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled million in the company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled million at year end compared with million at year end should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately million 
the company expects to contribute between and million to its defined benefit pension plans in

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates continued j stock based compensation the fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
for option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions  a lattice model is used to estimate fair value 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
the dividend yield is based on the company s most recent quarterly dividend rate 
changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation 
the compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures 
the company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures 
if actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures  adjustments to compensation expense may be required

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations continued in july  the fasb modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment 
the revised standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than percent that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired
