item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes also included in this k 
the following discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended december   as well as our future results 
overview the company is a producing  nevada based  gold and silver mining company with extensive  contiguous property in the historic comstock and silver city mining districts collectively  the comstock district 
the comstock district is located within the western portion of the basin and range province of nevada  between reno and carson city 
the company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the comstock district in since then  the company has consolidated a substantial portion of the comstock district  secured permits  built an infrastructure and brought the exploration project into production 
because of the comstock district s historical significance  the geology is well known and has been extensively studied by the company  our advisors and many independent researchers 
we have expanded our understanding of geology of the project area through vigorous surface mapping and drill hole logging 
the volume of geologic data is immense  and thus far the reliability has been excellent  particularly in the various lucerne mine areas 
we have amassed a large library of historical and current data and detailed surface mapping of comstock district properties 
as we continue our detailed exploration mapping  close spaced drilling  and initial mine production  new details emerge that significantly influence our understanding of the local and regional geology 
our lucerne resource area is located in storey county  nevada  approximately three miles south of virginia city and miles southeast of reno 
our dayton resource area is located in lyon county  nevada  approximately six miles south of virginia city 
access to the properties is by state route  a paved highway 
the near term goal of our business plan is to deliver stockholder value by validating qualified resources measured and indicated and reserves proven and probable of at least  gold equivalent ounces from our first two resource areas  lucerne and dayton  achieving initial commercial mining and processing operations in the lucerne mine with annual production rates of approximately  gold equivalent ounces  and growing production through the commercial development and expansions of both the lucerne and dayton mine plans 
as part of this plan  the company has developed the exploration and development drilling programs intended to validate mine design for the lucerne and dayton mines and also  to identify qualified resources and reserves in these two resource areas with three intermediate objectives of validating measured and indicated resources containing   and  gold equivalent ounces  respectively and the remaining planned objective of  gold equivalent ounces 
the company has already met the first three intermediate resource validation objectives by validating measured and indicated resources containing over  gold equivalent ounces 
the company has also developed a mine plan intended to achieving initial commercial mining and processing operations in the lucerne mine and ramp those annual production rates to approximately  gold equivalent ounces 
the company achieved initial production and held its first pour of gold and silver on september   with three remaining intermediate objectives from ramping up production to rates of   and  gold equivalent ounces per annum  respectively 
we continue acquiring additional properties in the comstock district  expanding our footprint and creating opportunities for exploration and mining 
the company now owns or controls approximately  acres of mining claims and parcels in the comstock and silver city districts 
the acreage is comprised of approximately  acres of patented claims private lands and surface parcels private lands and approximately  acres of unpatented mining claims  which the bureau of land management blm administers 
automatic conversion of series a preferred stock the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock if the daily volume weighted average price exceeds for any trading days during any consecutive trading day period  then all outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock will be forced to convert into shares of common stock  based on the then effective conversion price 
the company will provide each holder with notice within one trading day of meeting the requirements specifying the shares of preferred stock held by each holder and the date three trading days later when the conversion will take effect 
equity raises in october  the company raised approximately million in gross proceeds approximately million  net of issuance costs by issuing shares of the series b preferred stock pursuant to a the series b purchase agreement  representing in the aggregate about one third of the common equity of the company  on a fully diluted and as converted  in the money basis 
each share of the series b preferred stock is convertible at the holder s election into shares of common stock  therefore converting into common stock at a conversion price per share of 
the common stock underlying the series b preferred stock is issuable at a fixed conversion rate subject to anti dilution adjustments currently equal to million shares of common stock 
in february  the company raised million in gross proceeds approximately million  net of issuance costs through an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
in november and december  the company raised million in gross proceeds approximately million  net of issuance costs through an underwritten public offering of  shares under the company s registration statement on form s  of our common stock at a price of per share 
our team we believe we have exceptional geological  geo statistical  engineering  regulatory  environmental  financial and operating competencies on our management team 
as of december   we have full time employees and part time mining employee 
we also have full time and part time hospitality employees working for the gold hill hotel  inc in addition  we have strengthened our system through agreements and relationships with certain key partners 
exploration in january  the company launched its current exploration and development drilling program the drill program 
the drill program has been revised to focus on three significant objectives infill drilling and expansion of the lucerne mine  infill drilling in the dayton resource area for the development of our second mine  and step out and infill drilling in the east side of the lucerne resource area 
the drill program does not currently contemplate exploration drilling on the company s other high priority targets  including spring valley  occidental  oest and the northern target areas 
the company did complete some exploration drilling in spring valley in early the majority of the drill program activities in focused on infill and development drilling in the lucerne resource area  comprised of holes totaling  feet 
the drilling program consisted of reverse circulation rc holes  totaling  feet  and core holes  totaling  feet 
the drilling totals also included fourteen widely spaced exploration holes in spring valley and step out and infill holes in the east side target 
the total cost of the program was million  with an average cost per foot of 
lucerne the lucerne resource area includes the previously operated lucerne  hartford  and billie the kid pits  the historic justice and keystone surface cuts and underground mines  and the historic woodville bonanza 
the modeled mineralization covers approximately  feet of strike length 
the lucerne resource area is also host to the company lucerne mine  opened in  with an associated heap leach and merrill crowe processing facility 
although the company only drilled a limited number of east side holes  the results led to the discovery and interpretation of the chute zone by company geologists 
this intersection between the northwest striking and northeast dipping silver city fault  and a series of northeast striking and southeast dipping structures hosts a zone of enhanced mineralization 
the zone currently mapped dimensions of to feet by feet by feet 
the company s geologists have recognized the enhanced grades of precious metals when northeasterly striking mineralized structures intersected the silver city fault zone 
spring valley the spring valley exploration target lies at the southern end of the comstock district  where the mineralized structures lie mostly concealed beneath a veneer of sediment gravels 
the area includes the kossuth claim south of state route  the dondero property  the new daney lode mining claims  and the company s placer mining claims in spring valley and gold canyon 
the spring valley drilling began january   and was completed march  the initial spring valley drilling was designed as a follow up of the company s successful spring valley discovery and to verify the continuity of the dayton geological model southward beyond state route into this predominantly unexplored area 
two drill rigs were used in this initial phase  completing reverse circulation rc holes  totaling  feet  and two core holes totaling  feet 
spring valley assay results have been received for all of the rc drilling  showing that all rc holes encountered intervals of significant mineralization gold grades greater than ounces per ton or silver grades greater than ounces per ton  and length of at least ten feet 
on going drill program the ongoing drill program includes continuing infill drilling  metallurgical testing  and geotechnical testing for a second mine in the dayton resource area 
in addition  the company is designing a new phase of exploration drilling to include its highest potential targets  including fully developing the east side and chute targets in the lucerne resource area  and the continuation of the mineralization from the dayton resource area 
the infill drilling in the dayton resource area will provide detailed information needed to create a preliminary mine plan for the proposed dayton mine  to be developed in parallel with the expanded lucerne mine 
with that plan  the company will complete a feasibility study  a prerequisite before commencing the permitting for the second mine 
the step out drilling phase in the east side of the lucerne resource area will test the continuity of mineralization to the north and south  and at greater depths to the east 
the infill drilling phase will then provide the detailed information needed to develop an expanded mine plan for the lucerne mine 
that mine plan will position the company to complete an economic feasibility study  a prerequisite before any permitting for the expanded mine becomes foreseeable 
production during  we completed the expansion of the heap leach pad from its three existing cells to five cells 
we also installed the crushing facility  including the jaw and cone crusher  the super stacker  conveyors and related components on site and received and installed the new merrill crowe facility 
we also commissioned the crushing and merrill crowe facilities including successful calibration and testing 
we commenced the haulage of mineralized material from the mine to the crushing facility  and crushing and stacking material 
once material was stacked  we commenced processing and poured dor  recording our first revenue from metal sales in the fourth quarter of metal sales in the fourth quarter totaled million  with gold revenues of million 
we also produced million of silver 
silver is accounted for as a by product credit in costs applicable to mining revenue for financial reporting purposes 
in  we shipped  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver 
the company continues ramping up its production and plans to achieve a production rate of gold equivalent ounces poured per week  or over  gold equivalent ounces per annum 
since pouring commenced  the company has averaged approximately gold equivalent ounces poured per week 
the company is continuously adjusting its operations to improve grade  maximize yields and increase tons crushed and stacked 
the company continues to advance activities in each of these areas on a weekly basis keeping it on track for achieving the gold equivalent ounce target rate  by late april during  the company crushed and stacked over  dry tons of mineralized material starting from the time that production began  delivering  estimated ounces of recoverable gold and over  estimated ounces of recoverable silver to the leach pad  positioning the company well for growth 
material placed on the heap leach pad remains under solution until the target recovery rates are achieved 
throughout this period  the recovery of gold and silver continues  but the most effective economic recovery of gold and silver takes between to days to complete 
the company has recovered of the estimated recoverable gold and of the estimated recoverable silver from the portion of the heap under leach the longest 
preliminary laboratory metallurgical test results suggest that ultimate heap leach recovery will meet or exceed the estimated ounces of recoverable gold and silver 
through december   the company realized an average price of  price per ounce of gold  including the benefits of the first commemorative bar  and a average sales price per ounce of silver 
in comparison  commodity market prices in the fourth quarter of averaged  per ounce of gold and per ounce of silver 
operating costs during the fourth quarter  actual lucerne mine operating expenses were approximately million  million net of silver credits or approximately million annualized 
these costs include higher hauling costs due to our inability to use an existing haul road that crosses lot as discussed below 
the estimated operating expenses do not include corporate administration or other general and administrative costs  nor do they include exploration and mine development costs 
the company is not currently drilling and does not plan on resuming these activities until the second half of haulage and the blm during february  the company announced that the united states department of the interior bureau of land management blm made a determination to allow the company to move forward with a class color of title act claim cot claim with respect to lot  a acre parcel in gold hill  nevada 
as part of this process  the blm is allowing for the company limited interim use of the existing haul road segment that crosses lot  providing a more efficient connection to a previously granted  non exclusive right of way row for access to its processing facility in american flat 
in order to comply with the guidelines in the currently authorized row grant  the company will use different  highway rated vehicles 
the vehicles will travel a shorter distance while carrying a larger load  thus decreasing overall traffic on american flat road  while also reducing haul truck traffic on the state route 
these vehicles will also un block the mine area from logistical constraints imposed by the previously used vehicles  increase throughput by increasing the haul per trip and reduce costs significantly by reducing the number of trips 
we are renting ten of these highway rated vehicles for one year  at a cost of  per month  per vehicle 
each vehicle is rented pursuant to a separate agreement that may be individually terminated by us at our discretion and returned to the lessor  subject to a termination fee  in certain instances 
in february  the company sold five caterpillar haul trucks  a loader  two dozers and a fuel truck for million in cash 
the company used a portion of the proceeds to pay down million in debt and expects to record a loss in the first quarter of of approximately million associated with the sale of those assets 
outlook during the first quarter of  modifications and optimizations have been engineered into the company mine planning  hauling  crushing and recovery systems 
the company has updated its financial analysis for the lucerne mine and anticipates annual operating expenses  including all mining and processing costs of approximately million per annum  excluding approximately million of additional haulage costs  with an anticipated production schedule currently processing at the rate of one million tons per annum  but also including plans for ramping up to a million tons per annum run rate 
mine administration costs are anticipated to be approximately million 
the company currently anticipates production rates beyond the gold equivalent ounces per week in the second half of the year  as it ramps up production with the goal of producing between  gold equivalent ounces in recent developments from january  through march   preferred shareholders converted  shares of convertible preferred stock into  common shares 
on january   the company published its fourth national instrument ni technical report the report authored by behre dolbear company usa  inc of denver colorado 
on january   the company determined that an accelerated capital contribution was required pursuant to section c of the limited liability company agreement of northern comstock mining llc  dated october  the operating agreement 
pursuant to the operating agreement  the required capital contributions of the company are automatically accelerated by  in reverse order beginning with its last capital contribution due on the thirty ninth anniversary of the operating agreement at such time after the date of the operating agreement that  gold equivalent ounces on the properties subject to the operating agreement are validated through an independent external report 
the company made such determination based on the company geological model estimates  as validated by the report 
the capital contribution is required to be made within days of such validation 
the capital contributions will be made in the form of series a convertible preferred stock 
land and mineral right acquisitions we will continue to increase our footprint in the comstock district through strategic acquisitions 
we consider the historic comstock district central to our growth strategy 
the following acquisitions were completed in on january   we completed the purchase of four patented lode claims totaling acres known as the dayton 
these mineral claims are contiguous with our spring valley mineral holdings 
the purchase price was  the purchase included a  upfront payment 
we issued a  interest note to finance the balance of the purchase price 
the note is payable in equal quarterly installments of  increasing to  in october with a balloon payment for the remaining principal amount due in five years 
at june   the note payable was net of imputed interest of  on february   we purchased a property in storey county  nevada near existing claims 
the purchase price was  paid in cash 
on february   we completed the purchase of the diez senores property  adjacent to our dayton properties  including of the surface rights and of the mineral rights on patented acres in lyon county  nevada 
the purchase price was  paid in cash 
on march   we completed the purchase of the acres known as the railroad and gold property 
the purchase price was  comprised of  paid upfront  in cash and  in company stock and a  note at interest per annum maturing in three years 
in april  we purchased the white house property 
the purchase price consisted of a  cash payment and the issuance of a  note payable 
the note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments of  with a final remaining principal payment due on april  the note is secured by a first deed of trust on the land 
during the year ended december   we purchased additional properties of which  was paid via the issuance of debt obligations 
comparative financial information below we set forth a summary of comparative financial information for the twelve months ended december   and difference difference versus versus revenue mining   revenue hospitality    costs applicable to mining revenue  hospitality operating costs   reclamation and exploration expenses   general and administrative   consulting and professional fees   loss for operations    other income expense loss on extinguishment of debt  change in fair value of debt beneficial conversion feature  change in fair value of warrant  change in fair value of derivatives   interest expense    interest income     other  net     income tax benefit   net loss    the company began selling gold and silver in october there was no mining revenue or costs applicable to mining revenue prior to on may   we acquired the historic gold hill hotel and five related cottages 
the hospitality revenue increased  for the year ended  compared to the same period in the increase is primarily the result of the hotel being owned for only a portion of there was no hospitality revenue prior to hospitality operating costs increased  for the year ended  compared to the same period in the increase is primarily the result of the hotel being owned for only a portion of there were no hospitality operating costs prior to reclamation and exploration expenses increased by  for the year ended as compared to the year ended the increase primarily resulted from activities associated with preparation and commencement of mining activities for the lucerne mine  including increases of  associated with a one time soil sampling program required prior to the commencement of mining activities   for higher mining and geological labor and related expense  including  related to stock based compensation expense  and  associated with permitting and related mine development costs for our lucerne resource area 
reclamation  exploration and test mining expenses increased by  for the year ended as compared to the year ended the increase was primarily caused by expenditures associated with increased reverse circulation development drilling and related metallurgical  assay and mine development activity in and for our lucerne and dayton resource areas in  including higher labor costs related to the expansion of the geological staff 
general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended as compared to the year ended this increase is primarily the result of  expense related to stock based compensation expense and  to a lesser extent  increases in director s fees  travel  insurance and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended as compared to the year ended this increase resulted primarily from stock grants issued to our outside directors valued at   in payroll related costs related to the addition of professional staff in  and  increase in marketing and financial services 
consulting and professional fees increased  for the year ended as compared to the year ended the increase results primarily from increased legal fees associated with permitting and related appeals  preparation of our sampling and analysis plan and related environmental compliance and  to a lesser extent  fees associated with internal control compliance and related business process improvement activities 
consulting and professional expenses increased  for the year ended as compared to the year ended the increase resulted primarily from an increase in valuation services  audit services  risk management including internal control compliance and business consulting services 
loss on extinguishment of debt of  was recorded during the year ended  resulting from the exchange of all of our  in senior secured convertible debentures  promissory notes and associated interest obligations for our series a preferred stock 
we recorded a non cash loss on the extinguishment of debt based on the fair value of the series a preferred stock and the net carrying value of the senior secured convertible debentures and promissory notes on the date of the extinguishment 
the difference in the respective fair value of  was recorded as a loss on the extinguishment of debt 
no such transactions occurred in or change in fair value of debt beneficial conversion feature and warrants decreased  to zero in the convertible debentures were extinguished in the debt to equity exchange on october  no such transactions occurred in or change in fair value of derivatives decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended this decrease resulted primarily from a  change in the fair value calculation of the contingent dividend payment derivative liability associated with our convertible preferred stock in compared to  in this change in fair value resulted primarily from the shorter time remaining on the contingent dividend feature and from a decrease in outstanding convertible preferred shares with this contingent dividend feature  partially offset by the increase in the value of the common stock 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of  resulting from the change in the fair value on gold calls  puts  and forwards held by the company in change in fair value of contingent dividend payment decreased  from an expense of  in to an income of  in this decrease resulted from the change in the fair value calculation of the contingent dividend payment derivative liability associated with our convertible preferred stock 
the change in fair value resulted primarily from a decrease in the value of common stock and  to a lesser extent  from a net decrease in outstanding convertible preferred shares of  with this contingent dividend feature 
interest expense increased  for the year ended as compared to the year ended this increase resulted from financing agreements entered into with resource income fund associated with our million working capital revolving credit facility and caterpillar financial associated with our million equipment financing loan  both entered into in and from an increase in promissory notes issued to acquire additional properties 
interest expense decreased  for the year ended as compared to the year ended this decrease resulted from extinguishing our senior secured convertible indentures  promissory notes and associated interest obligations during october interest income decreased by  during the year ended as compared to the year ended this decrease resulted from an overall decrease in income generating cash and cash equivalents  and available for sale securities during the year ended  compared to the same period in interest income increased by  during the year ended as compared to the year ended this increase resulted from an overall increase in income generating cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of  for the year ended december  after consideration of the allocation and the projected consolidated results and available taxable differences from the acquisition of the gold hill hotel  the company determined it would be able to realized approximately  of tax benefits from its deferred tax assets 
the company did not recognize any other net tax benefits from its losses because full valuation allowances are provided on the company s net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company raised million in gross proceeds approximately million  net of issuance costs through an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to the company from the offering will be approximately million  after deducting agent fees and estimated offering expenses 
the company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to accelerate prerequisite environmental studies  engineering and permitting for growing production through the commercial development and expansion of both the lucerne and dayton mine plans 
we also intend to use the net proceeds for expansion of our processing facilities associated with this growth  and plans for higher production rates in  potentially up to million tons per annum and related working capital 
cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   totaled  accounts receivable for gold and silver sales was  at december  for the year ended december   we used cash from operating activities of million compared to million in the same period of the use of operating cash flow of approximately million was primarily as a result of use of cash for costs applicable to mining revenue of million  exploration and mine development expenses of million  general administrative expenses of million  consulting and professional fees of million and a million increase in cash used in operating activities from changes in working capital  offset by a source of million from sales 
the increased use of operating cash flow of approximately million was primarily as a result of increased use of cash for costs applicable to mining revenue of million  exploration and mine development expenses of million  general administrative expenses of million  and consulting and professional fees of million  and a million net increase in cash used in operating activities from changes in working capital  primarily for increases in inventory and accounts receivable totaling million  offset somewhat by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities included million for the purchase of mineral rights and properties  plant and equipment  including approximately million for mining vehicles and equipment  million for processing equipment and million for land and buildings 
the increase in cash used in investing activities primarily resulted from expenditures related to production commenced in the latter part of net cash provided by financing activities was million comprised of million from proceeds from the issuance of common stock  net and million proceeds from long term debt borrowings  net partially offset by repayments of million on long term obligations 
the company has recurring net losses from operations  an accumulated deficit of million as of december  for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of million and had negative working capital ie current liabilities in excess of current assets of million 
the company commenced production in august  and poured its first gold and silver dor bars on september  the company filed an s registration statement on december  the filing is for a shelf registration statement for up to million 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january surety bond in july  the company placed a million reclamation surety bond  through the lexon surety group with the state of nevada bureau of mining regulation reclamation 
the bond insures for the estimated costs required to safely reclaim the natural environment to the regulatory standards established by the state of nevada division of environmental protection with the purposes of ensuring public safety  protecting the waters of the state  and providing for post mining land use 
the cash collateral due to lexon at december   is approximately million 
working capital and equipment financings in july  the company entered into a master loan and security agreement and other arrangements with caterpillar financial services corporation the cat equipment facility pursuant to which the company may borrow up to million secured by certain equipment of the company 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under the cat equipment facility 
the cat equipment facility bears interest at a rate of with a term of months except in the event of a default  including the occurrence of certain liquidity events  in which case the principal balance will bear interest at a rate of the lesser of per annum or the highest applicable rate allowed by law 
the company paid down million of this indebtedness in the first quarter of in july  the company entered into an agreement with resource income fund rif  with auramet trading  llc auramet acting as gold agent  pursuant to which the company may borrow up to million outstanding at any one time the auramet facility 
the company obligations under the auramet facility are secured by a security interest in all personal property of the company and certain real estate owned by the company within the company starter mine 
the auramet facility provides for the obligations to be repaid through the delivery of  ounces of gold payable in semi monthly deliveries of ounces each beginning february and ending july  or december  if any amounts are redrawn under the agreement 
to date  ounces have been delivered 
the agreement is non interest bearing except in the event of a default  in which case the balance would then bear interest at the lesser rate of per annum or the highest applicable rate allowed by law 
in connection with entry into the auramet facility  the company also entered into a purchase and sale agreement with auramet  and the company entered into a trading agreement the terms of which govern all transactions of metals between auramet and the company 
the company drew down million under the agreement in july the proceeds from the agreement have been recorded using an imputed interest rate of approximately 
the agreements contain customary representations  warranties  affirmative covenants  negative covenants  and events of default  as well as conditions to borrowings 
in august  the company began hauling mineralized material from its lucerne mine to its process area in american flat 
the company operating expenses significantly increased as it transitioned from initial start up mode to full scale production 
although the company s first gold and silver pour from mineralized material occurred in september  no assurances can be given as to timing or future results  given the inherently risky nature of start up  gold mining operations 
since pouring commenced  the company has averaged approximately gold equivalent ounces poured per week 
the company is successfully and continuously adjusting its operations to improve grade  maximize yields and increase tons crushed and stacked 
the company continues to advance activities in each of these areas on a weekly basis keeping it on track for achieving approximately gold equivalent ounce target rate  by late april the proceeds of the loan were used for working capital and capital expenditures associated with the commencement of production 
the proceeds will be repaid through the delivery of  ounces of gold payable in semi monthly deliveries of ounces each  which began in february  and scheduled to end in july  or december  if any amounts are redrawn under the agreement 
through february  the company has delivered its first three installments  or ounces 
due to a recent decline in gold prices  the company may opportunistically purchase some or all of the remaining  ounces of gold to be delivered to rif under the auramet facility from the market 
once we have completed the repayment of the auramet facility in  rif s security interest in our assets and the negative covenants under the auramet facility will be terminated 
we believe that this will enhance our flexibility to maximize production and develop resources 
assuming that planned future revenues meet management expectations  the company believes that it would have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the next twelve months through the use of current cash resources and existing financing arrangements 
however  in the event that production or other factors impacting future operating results are delayed or otherwise fall below management expectations  the company would be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing to sustain operations  and the availability of such financing on acceptable terms  if at all  cannot be assured 
our recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations require ongoing assessment regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at december  are summarized as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years debt     operating leases    reclamation and remediation obligations  other    amounts represent principal of  and estimated interest payments of  assuming no early extinguishment 
the company leases certain properties under operating leases expiring at various dates through see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts include minimum rental and minimum advance royalty payments 
we are required to mitigate long term environment impacts by stabilizing  contouring  resloping  and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed 
these reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
the estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation obligations are reflected here 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the company placed a million reclamation surety bond  through the lexon surety group lexon with the state of nevada s bureau of mining regulation reclamation bmrr 
the initial cash collateral percentage due to lexon is approximately of the total state bond amount of million 
at december   accrued expenses include million and other liabilities include million remaining due to lexon for the initial cash collateral 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ  and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies impairment of mineral rights and properties  plant and equipment the company assesses its mineral rights and properties  plant and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in the company business plans  changes in precious metal prices and significant downward revisions of estimated mineralization quantities 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value 
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices  the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses  and the outlook for global or regional demand conditions for gold and silver 
however  the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with the company business plans and long term investment decisions 
reclamation and remediation obligations reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs 
reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur 
we review  on at least an annual basis  the reclamation obligation at each mine site in accordance with guidance for accounting for asset retirement obligations 
reclamation obligations for inactive mines are accrued based on management s best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site 
such cost estimates include  where applicable  ongoing care  maintenance and monitoring costs 
changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised 
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation 
stock based compensation we measure share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the value of the award and recognize the cost as an expense over the term of the vesting period 
judgment is required in estimating the fair value of share based awards granted and their expected forfeiture rate 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
valuation allowances are recorded as reserves against net deferred tax assets by the company when it is determined that net deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the foreseeable future 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
derivative instruments the company has recorded derivatives relating to contingent dividend payments on our preferred shares and gold forwards  calls and puts 
these derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value 
changes in the fair market value of derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of derivative instruments that are sensitive to assumptions that include various observable and unobservable market inputs 
these inputs include variables such as volatility  stock price  expected life  probability of conversions  commodity prices  commodity volatilities  and interest rates 
variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives 
contingent liabilities management also makes judgments and estimates in recording contingent liabilities 
when a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or continent liabilities  we record our best estimate within related to the contingency 
if there is no best estimate  we record the minimum of the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise the estimates 
revision in estimates of the potential liabilities could materially affect our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
inventories  stockpiles and mineralized material on leach pads inventories  including stockpiles and mineralized material on leach pads are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is comprised of production costs for mineralized material produced and processed 
production costs include the costs of materials  costs of processing  direct labor  stock based compensation  mine site and processing facility overhead costs  and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
stockpiles stockpiles represent mineralized material that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile 
stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys 
costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the material  including applicable overhead  depreciation  and depletion relating to mining operations  and removed at each stockpile s average cost per ton 
we record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value nrv and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly 
nrv represents the estimated future sales price based on short term and long term metals prices  less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale 
the primary factors that influence the need to record write downs of stockpiles include short term and long term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor  fuel and energy  materials and supplies  as well as realized mineralized material grades and actual production levels 
if short term and long term metals prices decrease  the value of the stockpiles may decrease  and it may be necessary to record a write down of stockpiles to nrv 
cost allocation to stockpiles and the nrv measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs  metal recoveries  production levels  commodity prices  engineering data and other factors 
a high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions 
mineralized material on leach pads the company utilizes a heap leaching process to recover gold from its mineralized material 
under this method  the mineralized material is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical solution  which dissolves the gold contained in the material 
the resulting gold bearing solution is further processed in a facility where the gold is recovered 
costs are added to mineralized material on leach pads based on current mining and processing costs  including applicable depreciation and depletion relating to mining and processing operations 
costs are transferred from mineralized material on leach pads to subsequent stages of in process inventories as the gold bearing solution is processed 
the value of such transferred costs of mineralized material on leach pads is based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad 
the estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of material placed on the leach pads measured tons added to the leach pads  the grade of material placed on the leach pads based on assay data and a recovery percentage 
in general  leach pads recover approximately of the recoverable ounces in the first six months of leaching  declining each month thereafter until the leaching process is complete 
although the quantities of recoverable material placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of material placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered metallurgical balancing  the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels 
as a result  the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time 
variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write downs to nrv are accounted for on a prospective basis 
the significant assumptions in determining the nrv apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions include gold prices 
if short term and long term metals prices decrease  the value of the material on leach pads may decrease  and it may be necessary to record a write down of mineralized material on leach pads to nrv 
in process inventories in process inventories represent mineralized materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product through the merrill crowe process 
the value of in process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of material 
in process inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines  stockpiles and or leach pads plus the in process conversion costs  including applicable depreciation relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk metal price changes in the market price of gold may significantly affect our profitability and cash flow 
gold prices fluctuate widely due to factors such as  demand  global mine production levels  investor sentiment  central bank reserves  and the value of the us dollar 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents  all of which have maturities of less than three months and bear and pay interest in us dollars 
since we invest in highly liquid  relatively low yield investments  we do not believe interest rate changes would have a material impact on us 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to capital leases and other short term obligations we may incur in our normal operations 
the interest rates on our existing long term debt borrowings are fixed and as a result  interest due on borrowings are not impacted by changes in market based interest rates
