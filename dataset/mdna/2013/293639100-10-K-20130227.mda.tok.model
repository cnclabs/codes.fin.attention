table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the five largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states  with a nationwide portfolio in excess of stations in markets  including san francisco  boston  seattle  denver  portland  sacramento and kansas city 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
net revenues are gross revenues minus agency commissions 
the revenues are determined by the advertising rates charged and the number of advertisements broadcast 
we maximize our revenues by managing the inventory of advertising spots available for broadcast  which can vary throughout the day but is consistent over time 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the region in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by an independent advertising sales representative 
local and national revenues include revenues from the sale of advertising on our stations websites  the sale of advertising during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet  and e commerce 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation and non spot revenue 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  programming and promotional expenses 
other significant expenses that impact our profitability are interest and depreciation and amortization expense 
our performance is based upon the aggregate performance of our radio stations 
the following are some of the factors that impact a radio station s performance at any given time i audience ratings  ii program content  iii management talent and expertise  iv sales talent and expertise  v audience characteristics  vi signal strength  and vii the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an initial negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the associated risks and uncertainties 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the prior year and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
we evaluate net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant period to the performance of those same stations in the prior period whether or not owned or operated by us 
same station comparisons are used by us and those in the industry to assess the effect of acquisitions and dispositions on our operations throughout the periods measured 
for those acquisitions and dispositions that management considers as material  we include these stations in our same station computations 
none of the acquisitions noted below were considered material 

table of contents on may   we commenced operations under a time brokerage agreement tba for kblx fm  a station in the san francisco  california market 
on june   we acquired kblx fm for million in cash 
on january   we commenced operations under a tba for kufx fm  a station in the san jose  california  market 
during january  we began simulcasting the format of kufx fm on the frequency of one of our three san francisco stations owned and operated by us  thereby providing a complement to the signal coverage of the kufx fm format in the san francisco metropolitan market 
on february   we acquired kufx fm for million in cash 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   we identified a prior period error in the income taxes reported for the year ended december  we assessed the materiality of this error and concluded that it was not material to any of our previously issued financial statements 
we have revised the affected period presented herein to reflect the correct accounting 
this non cash item did not impact our operating income or operating cash flows for the current or prior period and had no impact on our cash taxes 
for further discussion  refer to note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
in june  we acquired kblx fm  a station in the san francisco  california  market for million in cash 
we commenced operations of kblx fm under a tba on may  that increased our revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million music royalty expense credit as a result of an industry settlement with bmi for fees paid in prior years 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of million in our boston market as a result of a write down in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses 
during november  we refinanced our existing debt by entering into a new senior secured credit facility as later modified in november that resulted in a basis point decrease in libor under our term b loan and issued new unsecured senior notes that increased our interest expense due to an increase in borrowing rates incurred under these agreements on our outstanding debt  an increase in deferred financing expense  which will be amortized over the terms of the new debt agreements  and a loss on extinguishment of debt 
during the second quarter of  management determined that on a more likely than not realization basis  a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was no longer required 
based on this assessment  management reversed the valuation allowance  which was a significant factor in the reduction of our income tax expense in on february   we acquired kufx fm  a station in the san jose  california  market for million in cash 
we began operating this station on january  under a tba that in increased our station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense 
in  we incurred million in merger and acquisition costs from legal and advisory expenses from an unsuccessful effort to acquire a large radio group operator  and lease abandonment costs associated with the acquisition of kufx fm 

table of contents net revenues years ended december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change net revenues increased in primarily due to growth during the second half of this growth was due to operational improvements from stations reformatted in  the contribution of political revenue  and incremental revenues from an acquisition during the second quarter of net revenues increased the most for our stations in the indianapolis  new orleans and norfolk markets  offset by revenue decreases for stations in our austin and portland markets 
net revenues for stations in our boston market  which were down for the year  experienced revenue growth during the second half of net revenues in san francisco were favorably impacted by our acquisition of kblx fm which we began operating on may  station operating expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change station operating expenses decreased primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and an industry settlement with bmi resulting in an expense credit of million 
depreciation and amortization expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expense amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expense decreased in primarily due to a trend of lower capital expenditures over the past several years 
corporate general and administrative expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change corporate general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decline in non cash compensation expense of million 
in the first quarter of  certain equity awards were issued and vested in that quarter which increased non cash compensation expense 

table of contents the decrease was offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense of million as our deferred compensation liability generally tracks movements in the stock market and an increase in legal expenses of million 
operating income years ended december  december  dollars in millions operating income amount of change percentage change operating income declined primarily due to an impairment loss of million in our boston market in connection with our annual review of broadcasting licenses during the second quarter of the decrease in operating income was offset by a reduction in station operating expenses  and a reduction of million in merger and acquisition costs 
interest expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates under our senior notes and our new financing agreement which we entered into during the fourth quarter of and which was subsequently modified during the fourth quarter of the rates are higher under our credit facility and senior notes as compared to our prior credit facility former facility 
for example  under the former facility  the applicable borrowing rate was a function of libor plus to 
by contrast  under the present credit facility  as modified  the applicable borrowing rate is a function of libor plus to for the revolver and libor plus to for the term b loan prior to the term b modification  the applicable borrowing rate was libor plus to 
the term b loan includes a libor floor of 
the senior notes bear interest at annually 
income before income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income before income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating income and an increase in net interest expense 

table of contents income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change income tax rate for the year ended december  the income tax rate was  which includes adjustments for expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and the recognition of tax benefits related to discrete items arising during the period 
our annual tax rate before discrete items was higher than the expected low range primarily due to the negative impact of the impairment loss recorded in the second quarter of income tax rate for the year ended december  the income tax rate was 
the income tax rate in would have been in the low range if we excluded primarily the impact of the valuation allowance reversal and the million prior period correction 
during the second quarter of  management determined that  on a more likely than not realization basis  a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was no longer required 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was initially established in as we were impacted by the economic downturn during this period which resulted in impairments to our broadcast licenses and goodwill in and these impairment losses negatively impacted our three year cumulative income 
contributing to management s assessment during the second quarter of that a full valuation allowance was no longer required  were sufficient positive indicators such as  but not limited to the then present economic conditions as compared to the economic conditions when the valuation allowance was established  a recent return to net profitability due to the absence of impairment losses  and management s expectation of future profitability  including available future taxable income under the current tax law to realize all of the tax benefits for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards 
the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets was assessed utilizing projections based on current operations 
the projections reflected a significant decrease in the tax amortization in the early years of the carryforward period as a significant portion of our intangible assets will be fully amortized 
these projections indicated that the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets was not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
estimated income tax rate for we estimate that our annual tax rate before discrete items  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be in the low range 
we anticipate that our rate in could be affected primarily by changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  adding facilities in states that on average have different income tax rates from states in which we currently operate and the resulting effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  the effect of recording changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions  taxes in certain states that are dependent on factors other than taxable income  and the limitations on the deduction of cash and certain non cash compensation expense for certain key employees 
our annual effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by i tax expense associated with non amortizable assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill  ii regulatory changes in certain states in which we operate  iii changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  iv changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and v changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
in the event we determine at a future time that it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax assets  we will increase our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and increase income tax expense in the period when we make such determination 

table of contents net deferred tax liabilities as of december  and  net deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively 
our net deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to differences between book and tax bases of certain of our indefinite lived intangibles broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
under accounting guidance  we do not amortize our indefinite lived intangibles for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
the amortization of our indefinite lived assets for tax purposes but not for book purposes creates deferred tax liabilities 
a reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite lived intangibles become impaired  or are sold  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
due to the amortization for tax purposes and not book purposes of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we expect to continue to generate deferred tax liabilities in future periods without consideration for any impairment loss in future periods 
net income years ended december  december  dollars in millions net income amount of change percentage change the net change was primarily attributable to the impairment loss  the increase in interest expense and for the reasons described under income taxes benefit 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   we identified a prior period error in the income taxes reported for the year ended december  we assessed the materiality of this error and concluded that it was not material to any of our previously issued financial statements 
we have revised the affected period presented herein to reflect the correct accounting 
this non cash item did not impact our operating income or operating cash flows for the current or prior period and had no impact on our cash taxes 
for further discussion  refer to note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 

table of contents in march  we amended our former facility  which increased our interest expense due to an increase in the amortization of deferred financing expense of million and an increase in the on going fees we pay under our former facility 
in march  we repurchased the remaining million of our then outstanding notes at par and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of deferred financing expenses 
for the year ended december   we repurchased million of our notes and recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced operation of certain of our tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of non strategic tower sites  which decreased net revenues tower rental income and station operating expenses for same station considerations  but had a marginal impact on our reported results of operations 
we also received million in cash that was reflected as financing method lease obligations due to our ability to participate in future profits from these towers 
during the year ended  we recorded an impairment loss of million in connection with our review of goodwill and broadcasting licenses 
see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further discussion of the contributing factors to the impairment loss 
the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of federal tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a result  we reversed the federal portion of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a net operating loss carryforward and recovered million in net revenues years ended december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change net revenues in decreased in the low single digits compared to contributing factors to our lower net revenues were format changes in a few of our key markets  overall market weakness in several markets where we operate and general sluggishness in advertiser demand 
we believe  however  that the new formats will improve the longer term growth prospects for these brands 
net revenues increased in the majority of our markets 
our net revenues increased the most for those radio stations located in our indianapolis  kansas city and seattle markets  offset by a decrease for those radio stations located in our boston  denver and san francisco markets 
station operating expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in station operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in our audience ratings expense primarily due to the continued rollout across our markets of ppm  a new audience measurement methodology  costs associated with the continued expansion of our digital initiatives  and an increase in employee compensation and benefits related to the lifting of our multi year wage freeze at the beginning of the year and the reinstatement of our k employer contribution 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expense amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expense decreased in primarily due to the decrease over the past several years in acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
corporate general and administrative expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change corporate general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in non cash compensation expense of million primarily due to the amortization of share based compensation awards that were granted during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of operating income years ended december  december  dollars in millions operating income amount of change percentage change the decrease in operating income was primarily due to an increase in station operating expenses  net of revenues  for the reasons described above under station operating expenses  an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses for the reasons described under corporate general and administrative expenses  and an increase of million in merger and acquisition costs 
interest expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decline in the average interest rate primarily due to the expiration of certain interest rate hedges that fixed a portion of our variable rate debt at a higher rate than the current short term eurodollar london interbank offered rate libor interest rate  and a decline in outstanding debt upon which interest is computed 
this decrease was offset by the increase in interest associated with the new credit facility and senior notes that were entered into during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents under our credit facility and former facility  our interest rate is variable 
the weighted average variable interest rate as of december  and  before taking into account the subsequent year s impact of the company s outstanding derivative interest rate instruments  was and  respectively 
income before income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income before income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income for the reasons as described above under operating income  a loss on derivative instruments  and a loss on the extinguishment of debt 
this decrease in operating income was offset by a decrease in interest expense for the reasons described under interest expense 
income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change for the year ended december   the income tax rate was a tax benefit of 
the income tax rate in would have been in the low range if we excluded primarily the impact of the valuation allowance reversal and the million prior period correction 
for the year ended december   the income tax rate was  which was primarily due to the recording of net deferred tax liabilities associated with non amortizable assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
these deferred tax liabilities cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense was offset by the reduction in liabilities from uncertain tax positions associated with the expiration of the statutes of limitations in certain tax jurisdictions 
we were impacted by the economic downturn which resulted in impairments to our broadcast licenses and goodwill in and due to these impairment losses and their impact on our three year cumulative income  we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in during the second quarter of  management determined that  on a more likely than not realization basis  this full valuation allowance was no longer required 
contributing to this assessment were sufficient positive indicators such as  but not limited to  the then present economic conditions as compared to the economic conditions when the valuation allowance was established  recent profitability  management s expectation of future profitability  including available future taxable income under the current tax law to realize all of the tax benefits for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards 
in addition  we do not have a history of our net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 
the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets was assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in the tax amortization in the early years of the carryforward period as a significant portion of our intangible assets will be fully amortized during that time 
accordingly  the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on this assessment  management determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  which resulted in a tax benefit to the statement of operations for the year ended december  due to the reversal of the full valuation allowance 
we decreased our valuation allowance by million to million as of december  from million as of december  
table of contents net income years ended december  december  dollars in millions net income amount of change percentage change the net change was primarily attributable to the reasons described above under income before income taxes benefit and under income taxes benefit 
future impairments we may determine that it will be necessary to take impairment charges in future periods if we determine the carrying value of our intangible assets is more than the fair value 
our annual impairment test of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill was performed in the second quarter of we may be required to retest prior to our next annual evaluation  which could result in a material impairment 
as of december   no interim impairment test was required during for our broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity over the past several years  we have used a significant portion of our cash flow to reduce our indebtedness 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire our outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
we may also use our capital resources to repurchase shares of our class a common stock  pay dividends to our shareholders and to purchase radio station assets 
generally  our cash requirements are funded from one or a combination of internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our credit agreements 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility and million principal amount of our senior notes 
in addition  we have outstanding financing method lease obligations of million and a million letter of credit 
during the year ended december   we decreased our outstanding debt by million excluding the impact of amortization of the original issue discount on our senior notes 
during the year ended  we decreased our outstanding debt by million 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
the outstanding debt under our former facility was paid in full on november  with the proceeds from new financing as described below 
the refinancing the credit facility on november   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders for a million senior secured credit facility  the credit facility  that is comprised of a a million revolving credit facility  or the revolver  that matures on november   and b a million term loan  or the term b loan  that matures on november  the term b loan amortizes in quarterly installments of million and any remaining principal and interest is due at maturity except for certain mandatory principal prepayments of excess cash flow and other events as described below 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the revolver and million under the term b loan 

table of contents the undrawn amount of the revolver was million as of december  the amount of the revolver available to us is a function of covenant compliance at the time of borrowing 
based on our financial covenant analysis as of december   we would not be limited in these borrowings 
the term b loan requires mandatory prepayments equal to of excess cash flow  as defined within the agreement  subject to incremental step downs to  depending on the consolidated leverage ratio  and mandatory prepayments from certain events such as the sale of certain property or the issuance of debt 
under the term b loan  an excess cash flow payment is due in the first quarter of each year based on the excess cash flow and leverage ratio for the prior year 
the excess cash flow payment due in the first quarter of  which is net of prepayments made through december   is approximately million 
the amount is included under the current portion of long term debt 
as of december   we are in compliance with all financial covenants and all other terms of the credit facility in all material respects 
our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants will be highly dependent on our results of operations 
a default under our credit facility or the indenture governing our senior notes could cause a cross default in the other 
any event of default could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we believe that over the next months we can continue to maintain our compliance with these covenants 
our operating cash flow remains positive  and we believe that it is adequate to fund our operating needs 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the revolver  will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next months  including our debt repayments 
as a result  we have not been required to rely upon  and we do not anticipate being required to rely upon  the revolver to fund our operations 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of our credit facility and any subsequent failure to negotiate and obtain any required relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may seek from time to time to amend our credit facility or obtain other funding or additional financing  which may result in higher interest rates 
the credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants which are defined terms within the agreement  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio that cannot exceed times through december   times as of december  and which decreases over time to times as of march  and thereafter  and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of times through december   times as of december   which increases over time to times as of september  and thereafter 
as of december   our consolidated leverage ratio was times and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was times 
on november   the term b loan was amended  which reduced our interest rates 
under the amended term b loan and depending on the consolidated leverage ratio  we may elect an interest rate per annum equal to the eurodollar london interbank offered rate libor plus fees that can range from to prior to the amendment  the fees ranged from to  and the base rate plus fees that can range from to prior to the amendment  the fees ranged from to 
the term b loan includes a libor floor of under the revolver and depending on the consolidated leverage ratio  we may elect an interest rate per annum equal to libor plus fees that can range from to  or the base rate plus fees that can range from to  where the base rate is the highest of a the administrative agent s prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  and c libor plus 
in addition  the revolver requires us to pay a commitment fee of per annum for the unused amount of the revolver 

table of contents we expect to use the revolver to provide for working capital  and provide for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and any or all of the following subject to certain restrictions repurchases of class a common stock  repurchases of our senior notes  dividends  investments and acquisitions 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  with limited exclusions including our real property 
the assets securing the credit facility are subject to customary release provisions which would enable us to sell such assets free and clear of encumbrance  subject to certain conditions and exceptions 
for accounting purposes  the term b loan was treated as new debt while the revolver was treated as a debt modification 
as a result  unamortized deferred financing costs were adjusted during the fourth quarter of as follows the former facility s term loan unamortized deferred financing costs of million were written off as a net loss on extinguishment of debt  and the former facility s revolving credit unamortized deferred financing costs of million were written off as a net loss on extinguishment of debt and million of unamortized deferred financing costs were deferred to be amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the revolver 
in addition  we recorded new deferred financing costs of i million for the term b loan that will be amortized under the effective interest rate method over the term  and ii million for the revolver that will be amortized under the straight line method over the term 
we treated the term b loan amendment in november under modification accounting and recorded deferred financing costs of a million that will be amortized over the remaining life of the term b loan under the effective interest rate method  and b unamortized deferred financing costs of million that will continue to be amortized over the remaining life of the term b loan under the effective interest rate method

a default under our senior notes could cause a default under our credit facility 
any event of default could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our former credit agreement our former facility consisted of a revolving credit facility of million  of which million was outstanding and paid in full through the refinancing on november   and a term loan of million  of which million was outstanding and paid in full through the refinancing on november  the former facility was secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
key terms of the former facility were as follows depending on the consolidated leverage ratio  we could elect an interest rate equal to the libor rate plus fees that ranged from to  or the base rate plus fees that ranged from to  where the base rate was the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the libor rate plus  and c the prime rate 
the amendment in march to the former facility was treated as a modification to a debt instrument 
as a result  in the first quarter of  we recorded deferred financing costs of million related to the amendment which were amortized over the remaining life of the former facility on a straight line basis for the revolving credit facility  and an effective interest rate method for the term loan 
in addition  unamortized deferred financing costs of million as of the amendment date were amortized over the remaining life of the former facility 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cash flows from operating activities decreased primarily due to the increase in interest expense associated with the refinancing of our outstanding debt during the fourth quarter of net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cash flows from operating activities decreased as the decrease in working capital of million was offset by a decrease in net revenues and a net increase in station operating expenses and corporate general and administrative expenses 
investing activities for the years ended december  and  net cash flows used in investing activities were million and million  respectively  which primarily reflect the purchase of radio station assets of million and million  respectively  and additions to property and equipment of million and million  respectively

credit rating agencies in connection with our refinancing during november  we received credit ratings from standard and poor s and moody s investor services 
on a continuing basis  these and other rating agencies may evaluate our debt in order to assign a credit rating 
any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity by limiting or eliminating our ability to obtain debt financing 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations financing method lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the total amount reflected in the above table includes principal and interest 
a our credit facility had outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december  the maturity under our credit facility could be accelerated if we do not maintain compliance with certain covenants 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of our credit facility 
b under our senior notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to maturity 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
certain leases include contingent rents for common area maintenance 
these amounts are included in minimum operating lease commitments when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable 
financing method lease obligations outstanding include principal and interest expense 
when our continuing involvement in this transaction ceases as of june   we expect we will discontinue finance accounting and instead treat our obligations under the accounting guidance for capital and operating leases 
also  we will recognize additional obligations included in the above table that cover lease payments after june  the term for each of the leases ranges from to years  which covers the period of continuing involvement and the period subsequent to continuing involvement 
for further discussion  see note  financing method lease obligations  in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
a we have purchase obligations of million including contracts primarily for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
b in addition to the above  we have million in liabilities related to i construction obligations of million  and ii our obligation to provide a million letter of credit 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million 
it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities  together with liabilities for deferred compensation and uncertain tax positions other than the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that are subject to the expiration of various statutes of limitation over the next months are reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years 
see note  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of deferred tax liabilities  including liabilities for unrecognized tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and as of the date this report was filed  we did not have any material off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations  including contingent obligations 

table of contents market capitalization as of december  and  our total market capitalization was million and million  respectively  which was million higher and million lower  respectively  than our book equity value on those dates

see note  intangible assets and goodwill  in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for a discussion of impairment losses over the past several years  which reduced our book equity value 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate our radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years 
consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
with the exception of a few stations  historically  most of our licenses have been renewed and we expect that all licenses will be and will continue to be renewed in the future 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation inflation has affected our performance by increasing our radio station operating expenses in terms of higher costs for wages and multi year vendor contracts with assumed inflationary built in escalator clauses 
the exact effects of inflation  however  cannot be reasonably determined 
there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our profits  especially since our credit facility is variable rate 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards  see note in the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
our historical reserves have generally ranged between and of our outstanding receivables 
recently  our accounts receivable reserve has been trending downward to the lower part of this range due to an improvement in our collection efforts and the expectation that we will continue to experience similar results 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that may reasonably result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of our tax rates we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is increased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
we expect our effective tax rate  before discrete items  changes in the valuation allowance and impairment losses  to be in the low range 
when these items are excluded  our effective tax rate has varied from the high range to the low range over the last several years 
in  our tax rate was which increased due to the reduction in income before income taxes as a result of the impairment loss of million recorded in the second quarter of our tax rate of in was primary impacted by management s determination during the second quarter of that  on a more likely than not realization basis  a full valuation allowance was no longer required 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was initially established in as we were impacted by the economic downturn during this period which resulted in impairments to our broadcast licenses and goodwill in and these impairment losses impacted our three year cumulative income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities requires us to account for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation of accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition of a tax benefit by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based upon its technical merits  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions  and review whether any new uncertain tax positions have arisen  on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  historical experience with similar tax matters  guidance from our tax advisors  and new audit activity 
a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which the change occurs 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates  as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rate as of december  would be an increase in income tax expense of million and a decrease in net income of million net income per basic and diluted share of for the year ended december  radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represents of our total assets at that date 
we must conduct impairment testing at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
after an impairment expense is recognized  the recorded value of these assets will be reduced by the impairment recognized and the resulting value will be the assets new accounting basis 
in  and  we recorded impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  for radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill 

table of contents broadcasting licenses we perform our broadcasting license impairment test by evaluating our broadcasting licenses for impairment using the direct method at the market level 
each market s broadcasting licenses are combined into a single unit of accounting for the purpose of testing impairment  as the broadcasting licenses in each market are operated as a single asset 
we determine the fair value of broadcasting licenses in each of our markets by relying on a discounted cash flow approach a year income model assuming a start up scenario in which the only assets held by an investor are broadcasting licenses 
our fair value analysis contains assumptions based upon past experience and reflects expectations of industry observers and includes judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a certain market 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to the discount rate  the market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type  the forecast growth rate of each radio market  the estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  the likely media competition within the market area  a tax rate  and future terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
the methodology used by us in determining our key estimates and assumptions was applied consistently to each market 
of the seven variables identified above  we believe that the assumptions in clauses through above are the most important to the determination of fair value 
we completed our annual impairment test for broadcasting licenses during the second quarter of and determined that the fair value of the broadcasting licenses was less than the carrying value in our boston market and  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of million 
the following table reflects these estimates and assumptions used in as compared to the second quarter of  the date of the most recent prior impairment test estimates and assumptions second second quarter quarter discount rate operating profit margin ranges expected for average stations in the markets where the company operates to to long term revenue growth rate range of the company s markets to to we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our broadcasting licenses  however  these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us  or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our broadcasting licenses below the amount reflected on the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize impairment charges  which could be material  in future periods 
the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our radio broadcasting licenses as of december  for units of accounting where the carrying value of the licenses is considered material to our financial statements geographical markets 
rather than presenting the percentage separately for each unit of accounting  management s opinion is that this table in summary form is more meaningful to the reader in assessing the recoverability of the broadcasting licenses 
in addition  the units of accounting are not disclosed with the specific market name as such disclosure could be competitively harmful to us 

table of contents units of accounting as of december  based upon the valuation as of june  percentage range by which fair value exceeds carrying value to greater than to greater than to greater than number of units of accounting carrying value in thousands broadcasting licenses valuation at risk as a result of the second quarter impairment test of our broadcasting licenses  there were seven units of accounting where the fair value exceeded their carrying value by or less as of june  in aggregate  these seven units of accounting at risk have a carrying value of million 
if overall market conditions or the performance of the economy deteriorates  advertising expenditures and radio industry results could be negatively impacted  including expectations for future growth 
this could result in future impairment charges for these or other of our units of accounting 
goodwill we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of each year by evaluating our goodwill for each reporting unit 
we determined that a radio market is a reporting unit and  in total  we assessed goodwill at separate reporting units four of our reporting units have no goodwill recorded as of june  
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the amount reflected in the balance sheet  an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to a reporting unit may be impaired  and we are required to perform a second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we compare the amount reflected in the balance sheet to the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
to determine the fair value  we use a market approach and  when appropriate  an income approach for each reporting unit 
the market approach compares recent sales and offering prices of similar properties 
the income approach uses the subject property s income generated over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price 
in step one of our goodwill analysis  we considered the results of the market approach and the income approach in computing the fair value of our reporting units 
in the market approach  we applied an estimated market multiple of between seven and a half times and eight times to each reporting unit s operating performance to calculate the fair value 
this multiple was consistent with the multiple applied to all markets in the second quarter of management believes that these approaches are an appropriate measurement given the current market valuations of broadcast radio stations together with the historical market transactions  including those in recent months 
factors contributing to the determination of the reporting unit s operating performance were historical performance and management s estimates of future performance 
in the income approach  we utilized the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit the key estimates and assumptions are included in the table below 
the results of step one indicated that it was not necessary to perform the second step analysis in any of the markets tested 
as a result of the step one test  no impairment loss was recorded during the second quarter of we performed a reasonableness test by comparing the fair value results for goodwill by using the implied multiple based on our cash flow performance and our current stock price to prevailing radio broadcast transaction multiples 
the following table reflects certain key estimates and assumptions used in the second quarter of and in the second quarter of  the date of the most recent prior impairment test 
the ranges for operating profit margin and revenue growth rates are for our markets 
in general  when comparing the second quarter of to the second quarter of the discount rate  which was estimated using required returns on debt and equity of publicly traded radio companies  did not change  the market specific operating profit margin range was relatively stable  and the market long term revenue growth rate did not change

the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit as of june  for reporting units under step one of the goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of rather than presenting the percentage separately for each reporting unit  management s opinion is that this table in summary form is more meaningful to the reader in assessing the recoverability of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
in addition  the reporting units are not disclosed with the specific market name as such disclosure could be competitively harmful to us 
reporting units as of december  based upon the valuation as of june  percentage range by which fair value exceeds carrying value to greater than to greater than to greater than number of reporting units carrying value in thousands goodwill valuation at risk as a result of the second quarter impairment test of our goodwill  there was one reporting unit that exceeded the carrying value by or less as of june  in aggregate  this one reporting unit has a carrying value of million  of which million is goodwill 
future impairment charges may be required on this  or other of our reporting units  as the discounted cash flow and market based models are subject to change based upon our performance  our stock price  peer company performance and their stock prices  overall market conditions  and the state of the credit markets 
sensitivity of key broadcasting licenses and goodwill assumptions if we were to assume a basis point change in certain of our key assumptions a reduction in the long term revenue growth rate  a reduction in the operating performance cash flow margin and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital used to determine the fair value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill using the income approach during the second quarter of  the following would be the incremental impact

to determine the radio broadcasting industry s future revenue growth rate  management uses publicly available information on industry expectations rather than management s own estimates  which could be different 
in addition  these long term market growth rate estimates could vary in each of our markets 
using the publicly available information on industry expectations  each market s revenues were forecasted over a ten year projection period to reflect the expected long term growth rate for the radio broadcast industry  which was further adjusted for each of our markets 
if the industry s growth is less than forecasted  then the fair value of our broadcasting licenses could be negatively impacted 
operating profit is defined as profit before interest  depreciation and amortization  income tax and corporate allocation charges 
operating profit is then divided by broadcast revenues  net of agency and national representative commissions  to compute the operating profit margin 
operating profit margins are projected based upon industry operating profit norms  which reflect market size and station type 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our radio stations in a market  but is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor 
if the outlook for the industry s growth declines  then operating profit margins would be negatively impacted  which would negatively impact the value of our broadcasting licenses 
the discount rate to be used by a typical market participant reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows for the broadcast industry 
the same discount rate was used for each of our markets 
the discount rate is calculated by weighting the required returns on interest bearing debt and common equity capital in proportion to their estimated percentages in an expected capital structure 
for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  see note  significant accounting policies  accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in our latest annual report on form k for the year ended december  note to the consolidated financial statements included with form k contains several other policies  including policies governing the timing of revenue recognition  that are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  but do not meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate credit facility 
from time to time  we may seek to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
if the borrowing rates under our libor loans were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our credit facility would increase by approximately million on an annual basis 
as of december   there were no interest rate transactions outstanding 
our credit exposure under our hedging agreements  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing such agreements in the event of nonperformance by our counterparty 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counterparties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties  but could recognize a loss in the event of nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the quantity of advertisers  the minimal reliance on any one advertiser  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertising business sectors
