item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis  as well as other sections in this report  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all references to years mean the relevant month period ended december overview general we are a technology based  specialty pharmaceutical company applying formulation and development expertise  as well as our drug delivery technology  to the development  manufacture and marketing of controlled release and niche generics  in addition to the development of branded products 
as of february   we marketed generic pharmaceuticals  which represent dosage variations of different pharmaceutical compounds through our own global pharmaceuticals division  another of our generic pharmaceuticals representing dosage variations of four different pharmaceutical compounds are marketed by our alliance and collaboration agreement partners 
as of february   we had applications pending at the fda  including three tentatively approved by the fda  and other products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed 
in the generic pharmaceuticals market  we focus our efforts on controlled release generic versions of selected brand name pharmaceuticals covering a broad range of therapeutic areas and having technically challenging drug delivery mechanisms or unique product formulations 
we employ our technologies and formulation expertise to develop generic products that will reproduce the brand name product s physiological characteristics but not infringe any valid patents relating to the brand name product 
we generally focus on brand name products as to which the patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient have expired or are near expiration  and we employ our proprietary formulation expertise to develop controlled release technologies that do not infringe patents covering the brand name products controlled release technologies 
we develop specialty generic pharmaceuticals that we believe present certain competitive advantages  such as difficulty in raw materials sourcing  complex formulation or development characteristics or special handling requirements 
we have also recently expanded our generic pharmaceutical products portfolio to include alternative dosage form products primarily through alliance and collaboration agreements with third parties 
in the brand name pharmaceuticals market  we are developing products for the treatment of central nervous system cns disorders 
our brand name product portfolio currently consists of one late stage branded pharmaceutical product candidate which we are developing internally  rytary for the treatment of symptomatic parkinson s disease  and other development stage projects to which we are applying our formulation and development expertise to develop differentiated  modified  or controlled release versions of currently marketed either in the us or outside the us drug substances 
we also sell and promote branded pharmaceutical products developed by an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company through our direct sales force 
we intend to expand our brand name products portfolio primarily through internal development and also through licensing and acquisition 
we operate in two segments  referred to as the global pharmaceuticals division or global division and the impax pharmaceuticals division or impax division 
the global division develops  manufactures  sells  and distributes generic pharmaceutical products primarily through the following sales channels the global products sales channel  for sales of generic prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers  large retail drug chains  and others  the private label product sales channel  for generic pharmaceutical over the counter and prescription products we sell to unrelated third party customers who in turn sell the product to third parties under their own label  the rx partner sales channel  for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements  and the otc partner sales channel  for sales of generic pharmaceutical over the counter products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements 
we sell our global division products within the continental united states and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
we have no sales in foreign countries 
revenues from global product sales channel and the private label product sales channel are reported under the caption global product sales  net in our consolidated results of operations 
we also generate revenue in our global division from research and development services provided under a joint development agreement with another pharmaceutical company  and we report such revenue under the caption research partner revenue in our consolidated results of operations 
the impax division is engaged in the development of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products through improvements to already approved pharmaceutical products to address central nervous system cns disorders 
we have one late stage branded pharmaceutical product candidate which we are developing internally  rytary for the treatment of symptomatic parkinson s disease  for which the nda was accepted for filing by the fda in february in january  the fda issued a complete response letter regarding the nda for rytary 
a complete response letter is issued by the fda s center for drug evaluation and research when the review cycle for a pharmaceutical product candidate is complete and the application is not yet ready for approval 
in the complete response letter  the fda indicated that it required a satisfactory re inspection of our hayward manufacturing facility as a result of the warning letter issued to us in may before the nda may be approved by the fda due to the facility s involvement in the development of rytary and supportive manufacturing and distribution activities 
during the assessment of the nda  we withdrew our hayward site as an alternative site of commercial production at launch for rytary 
we are currently working with the fda on the appropriate next steps for the rytary nda and on resolving the warning letter 
the impax division also has a number of other product candidates that are in varying stages of development 
in addition  the impax division is engaged in product sales through a direct sales force focused on selling to physicians  primarily in the cns community  pharmaceutical products developed by an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company pursuant to a distribution  license  development and supply agreement 
additionally  we generate revenue in the impax division from research and development services provided under a development and license agreement with another unrelated third party pharmaceutical company  and we report such revenue in the line item research partner in our consolidated results of operations 
finally  we generate revenue in the impax division under a license  development and commercialization agreement with another unrelated third party pharmaceutical company  and we report such revenue in the line item rx partner in our consolidated results of operations 
we have entered into several alliance  collaboration or license and distribution agreements with respect to certain of our products and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future 
these agreements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on terms which ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us 
relationships with alliance and collaboration partners may also include risks due to the failure of a partner to perform under the agreement  incomplete marketplace information  inventories  development capabilities  regulatory compliance and commercial strategies of our partners and our agreements may be the subject of contractual disputes 
if we  or our partners  are not successful in commercializing the products covered by the agreements  such commercial failure could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to a license and distribution agreement  we are dependent on an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company to supply us with our authorized generic adderall xr  which we market and sell 
we experienced disruptions related to the supply of our authorized generic adderall xr under the license and distribution agreement during each of the years ended december   and in november  we filed suit against the third party supplier of our authorized generic of adderall xr for breach of contract and other related claims due to a failure to fill our orders as required by the license and distribution agreement 
we entered into a settlement agreement with the third party supplier in february if we suffer supply disruptions related to our authorized generic adderall xr product in the future  our revenues and relationships with our customers may be materially adversely affected 
further  we may enter into similar license and distribution agreements in the future 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and the rules and regulations of the us securities exchange commission sec require the use of estimates and assumptions  based on complex judgments considered reasonable  and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant judgments are employed in estimates used in determining values of tangible and intangible assets  legal contingencies  tax assets and tax liabilities  fair value of share based compensation related to equity incentive awards issued to employees and directors  and estimates used in applying the company s revenue recognition policy including those related to accrued chargebacks  rebates  distribution service fees  product returns  medicare  medicaid  and other government rebate programs  shelf stock adjustments  and the timing and amount of deferred and recognized revenue and deferred and amortized product manufacturing costs under the company several alliance and collaboration agreements 
actual results may differ from estimated results 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the year ended december  although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable when made  they are based upon information available to us at the time they are made 
we periodically review the factors having an influence on our estimates and  if necessary  adjust such estimates 
although historically our estimates have generally been reasonably accurate  due to the risks and uncertainties involved in our business and evolving market conditions  and given the subjective element of the estimates made  actual results may differ from estimated results 
this possibility may be greater than normal during times of pronounced economic volatility 
global product sales  net  and impax product sales  net 
we recognize revenue from direct sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic  revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenue from direct product sales at the time title and risk of loss pass to customers  which is generally when product is received by the customer 
we establish accrued provisions for estimated chargebacks  rebates  distribution service fees  product returns  shelf stock and other pricing adjustments in the period we record the related sales 
consistent with industry practice  we record an accrued provision for estimated deductions for chargebacks  rebates  distribution service fees  product returns  medicare  medicaid  and other government rebate programs  shelf stock adjustments  and other pricing adjustments  in the same period when revenue is recognized 
the objective of recording provisions for these deductions at the time of sale is to provide a reasonable estimate of the aggregate amount we expect to ultimately credit our customers 
since arrangements giving rise to the various sales credits are typically time driven ie particular promotions entitling customers who make purchases of our products during a specific period of time  to certain levels of rebates or chargebacks  these deductions represent important reductions of the amounts those customers would otherwise owe us for their purchases of those products 
customers typically process their claims for deductions in a reasonably timely manner  usually within the established payment terms 
we monitor actual credit memos issued to our customers and compare such actual amounts to the estimated provisions  in the aggregate  for each deduction category to assess the reasonableness of the various reserves at each quarterly balance sheet date 
differences between our estimated provisions and actual credits issued have not been significant  and are accounted for in the current period as a change in estimate in accordance with gaap 
we do not have the ability to specifically link any particular sales credit to an exact sales transaction and since there have been no material differences  we believe our systems and procedures are adequate for managing our business 
an event such as the failure to report a particular promotion could result in a significant difference between the estimated amount accrued and the actual amount claimed by the customer  and  while there have been none to date  we would evaluate the particular events and factors giving rise to any such significant difference in determining the appropriate accounting 
chargebacks 
we have agreements establishing contract prices for specified products with some of our indirect customers  such as managed care organizations  hospitals  and government agencies who purchase our products from drug wholesalers 
the contract prices are lower than the prices the customer would otherwise pay to the wholesaler  and the difference is referred to as a chargeback  which generally takes the form of a credit memo issued by us to reduce the gross sales amount we invoiced to our wholesaler customer 
we recognize an estimated accrued provision for chargeback deductions at the time we ship the products to our wholesaler customers 
the primary factors we consider when estimating the accrued provision for chargebacks are the average historical chargeback credits given  the mix of products shipped  and the amount of inventory on hand at the major drug wholesalers with whom we do business 
we monitor aggregate actual chargebacks granted and compare them to the estimated accrued provision for chargebacks to assess the reasonableness of the chargeback reserve at each quarterly balance sheet date 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the chargeback reserve for the years ended december   and as of december  in s chargeback reserve beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross product sales the aggregate provision for chargebacks  as a percent of gross product sales  decreased slightly from to primarily as a result of sales of impax labeled zomig  which we began selling during the year ended december   and which carries a lower average chargeback amount relative to our other products 
the lower chargebacks on impax labeled zomig were partially offset by higher chargebacks on sales of our authorized generic adderall xr and fenofibrate products during the year ended december  which resulted in lower net selling prices for those products 
the lower net selling prices on our authorized generic adderall xr and fenofibrate products were the result of increased competition during the year ended december  with respect to our authorized generic adderall xr products  in june  an unrelated pharmaceutical company received fda approval for a competitor product to ours and began marketing their product 
with respect to our fenofibrate products  in october  an unrelated pharmaceutical company received fda approval for a competitor product to our fenofibrate capsules and began marketing their product 
see results of operations below for additional discussion on the impact of our authorized generic of adderall xr and fenofibrate product sales on our financial condition 
the lower provision for chargebacks as a percent of gross product sales in as compared to both and was principally the result of the launch of our tamsulosin product  which generally resulted in higher gross global product sales and carried a lower average chargeback credit amount  relative to our other products sold through our global division s global products sales channel  during the year ended december  we commenced sales of our tamsulosin product on march  and had contractual market exclusivity for this generic product for the succeeding eight weeks  during which we were able to achieve high market share penetration 
our tamsulosin product sales after the end of the contractual exclusivity period  have not remained at this level  as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late april  and have resulted in both price erosion and reduction of our market share 
see results of operations below for additional discussion on the impact of tamsulosin and our authorized generic of adderall xr product sales on our financial condition 
rebates 
in an effort to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace and to promote sales and customer loyalty  we maintain various rebate programs with our customers to whom we market our products through our global division global products sales channel 
the rebates generally take the form of a credit memo to reduce the invoiced gross sales amount charged to a customer for products shipped 
we recognize an estimated accrued provision for rebate deductions at the time of product shipment 
the primary factors we consider when estimating the provision for rebates are the average historical experience of aggregate credits issued  the mix of products shipped and the historical relationship of rebates as a percentage of total gross product sales  the contract terms and conditions of the various rebate programs in effect at the time of shipment  and the amount of inventory on hand at the major drug wholesalers with which we do business 
we also monitor aggregate actual rebates granted and compare them to the estimated aggregate provision for rebates to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate rebate reserve at each quarterly balance sheet date 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the rebate reserve for the years december   and as of december  in s rebate reserve beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross product sales the increase in the provision for rebates as a percent of gross product sales from to was principally the result of increased competition on our authorized generic adderall xr and fenofibrate products during the year ended december  which resulted in lower net selling prices 
with respect to our authorized generic adderall xr products  in june  an unrelated pharmaceutical company received fda approval for a competitor product to ours and began marketing their product 
with respect to our fenofibrate products  in october  an unrelated pharmaceutical company received fda approval for a competitor product to our fenofibrate capsules and began marketing their product 
see results of operations below for additional discussion on the impact of our authorized generic of adderall xr and fenofibrate product sales on our financial condition 
as noted in the table above  the provision for rebates  as a percent of gross product sales remained consistent from to returns 
we allow our customers to return product i if approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request and ii if such products are returned within six months prior to  or until twelve months following  the products expiration date 
we estimate and recognize an accrued provision for product returns as a percentage of gross sales based upon historical experience of product sales 
we estimate the product return reserve using a historical lag period  which is the time between when the product is sold and when it is ultimately returned  and return rates  adjusted by estimates of the future return rates based on various assumptions  which may include changes to internal policies and procedures  changes in business practices  and commercial terms with customers  competitive position of each product  amount of inventory in the wholesaler supply chain  the introduction of new products and changes in market sales information 
we also consider other factors  including significant market changes which may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns 
we monitor aggregate actual product returns on a quarterly basis and we may record specific provisions for product returns we believe are not covered by historical percentages 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the accrued product returns for the years ended december   and as of december  in s returns reserve beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross product sales the provision for returns as a percent of gross product sales has remained relatively low during the three year period ended december  as the result of continued improvement in our historical experience of actual return credits processed 
our historical experience for returns has continued to remain low in recent years due to low levels of returns for new products such as tamsulosin and authorized generic adderall xr  as well as for other high volume products such as fenofibrate 
credits issued during included million related to a recall of our authorized generic adderall xr products which was initiated by our unrelated third party manufacturer of those products 
other credits issued during amounted to million  similar to the total credits issued in each of and medicaid and other government pricing programs 
as required by law  we provide a rebate payment on drugs dispensed under the medicaid  medicare part d  tricare  and other us government pricing programs 
we determine our estimates of the accrued rebate reserve for government programs primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states  and other jurisdictions  and any new information regarding changes in the pricing programs which may impact our estimate of rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider historical payment rates and processing lag for outstanding claims and payments 
we record estimates for government rebate payments as a deduction from gross sales  with corresponding adjustments to accrued liabilities 
the accrual for payments under government pricing programs totaled  and  as of december  and shelf stock adjustments 
based upon competitive market conditions  we may reduce the selling price of some of our products to customers for certain future product shipments 
we may issue a credit against the sales amount to a customer based upon their remaining inventory of the product in question  provided the customer agrees to continue to make future purchases of product from the company 
this type of customer credit is referred to as a shelf stock adjustment  which is the difference between the sales price and the revised lower sales price  multiplied by an estimate of the number of product units on hand at a given date 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us in response to market conditions  including estimated launch dates of competing products and estimated declines in market price 
the accrued reserve for shelf stock adjustments totaled  and  as of december  and historically  differences between our estimated and actual credits issued for shelf stock adjustments have not been significant 
rx partner and otc partner 
each of our rx partner and otc partner agreements contain multiple deliverables in the form of products  services and or licenses over extended periods 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification tm asc topic supplemented sab provides guidance for accounting for such multiple element revenue arrangements 
with respect to our multiple element revenue arrangements that are material to our financial results  we determine whether any or all of the elements of the arrangement should be separated into individual units of accounting under fasb asc topic if separation into individual units of accounting is appropriate  we recognize revenue for each deliverable when the revenue recognition criteria specified by sab are achieved for the deliverable 
if separation is not appropriate  we recognize revenue and related direct manufacturing costs over the estimated life of the agreement or our estimated expected period of performance using either the straight line method or a modified proportional performance method 
the rx partners and otc partners agreements obligate us to deliver multiple goods and or services over extended periods 
such deliverables include manufactured pharmaceutical products  exclusive and semi exclusive marketing rights  distribution licenses  and research and development services 
in exchange for these deliverables  we receive payments from our agreement partners for product shipments and research and development services  and may also receive other payments including royalty  profit sharing  upfront payments  and periodic milestone payments 
revenue received from our partners for product shipments under these agreements is generally not subject to deductions for chargebacks  rebates  product returns  and other pricing adjustments 
royalty and profit sharing amounts we receive under these agreements are calculated by the respective agreement partner  with such royalty and profit share amounts generally based upon estimates of net product sales or gross profit which include estimates of deductions for chargebacks  rebates  product returns  and other adjustments the alliance agreement partners may negotiate with their customers 
we record the agreement partner adjustments to such estimated amounts in the period the agreement partner reports the amounts to us 
we apply the updated guidance of asc  multiple element arrangements  to the strategic alliance agreement with teva pharmaceuticals curacao nv  a subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
teva agreement 
we look to the underlying delivery of goods and or services which give rise to the payment of consideration under the teva agreement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
consideration received as a result of research and development related activities performed under the teva agreement is initially deferred and recorded as a liability captioned deferred revenue 
we recognize the deferred revenue on a straight line basis over our expected period of performance for such services 
consideration received as a result of the manufacture and delivery of products under the teva agreement is recognized at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally when the product is received by teva 
we recognize profit share revenue in the period earned 
otc partner revenue is related to our alliance and collaboration agreement with pfizer inc formerly wyeth with respect to the supply of over the counter pharmaceutical products 
the otc partner sales channel is no longer a core area of our business  and the over the counter pharmaceutical products we sell through this sales channel are older products which are only sold to pfizer  and which we sell at a loss 
the manufacturing of the over the counter pharmaceutical products is our only continuing obligation under this agreement with pfizer 
in order to avoid deferring the losses we incur upon shipment of these products to pfizer  inc  we recognize revenue  and the associated manufacturing costs  at the time title and risk of loss passes to pfizer which is generally when the product is shipped by us 
we recognize profit share revenue in the period earned 
research partner 
we have entered into development agreements with unrelated third party pharmaceutical companies under which we are collaborating in the development of five dermatological products  including four generic products and one branded dermatological product  and one branded cns product 
under each of the development agreements  we received an upfront fee with the potential to receive additional milestone payments upon completion of contractually specified clinical and regulatory milestones 
additionally  we may also receive royalty payments from the sale  if any  of a successfully developed and commercialized branded product under one of the development agreements 
we defer and recognize revenue received from the provision of research and development services  including the upfront payment and the milestone payments received before january  on a straight line basis over the expected period of performance of the research and development services 
we recognize revenue received from the achievement of contingent research and development milestones after january  currently in the period such payment is earned 
we will recognize royalty fee income  if any  as current period revenue when earned 
promotional partner 
we entered into a promotional services agreement with an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company under which we provided physician detailing sales calls services to promote certain of the unrelated third party company s branded drug products 
we received service fee revenue in exchange for providing this service 
we recognized revenue from the provision of physician detailing sales calls as such services were rendered 
our obligation to provide physician detailing sales calls under the promotional services agreement ended on june  estimated lives of alliance and collaboration agreements 
because we may defer revenue we receive under our alliance agreements  and recognize it over the estimated life of the related agreement  or our expected period of performance  we are required to estimate the recognition period under each such agreement in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in each period 
sometimes this estimate is based on the fixed term of the particular alliance agreement 
in other cases the estimate may be based on more subjective factors as noted in the following paragraphs 
while changes to the estimated recognition periods have been infrequent  such changes  should they occur  may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as an illustration  the consideration received from the provision of research and development services under the joint development agreement with valeant pharmaceuticals international  inc valeant agreement  including the upfront fee and milestone payments received before january   have been initially deferred and are being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over our expected period of performance to provide research and development services under the valeant agreement 
the completion of the final deliverable under the valeant agreement represents the end of our estimated expected period of performance  as we will have no further contractual obligation to perform research and development services under the valeant agreement  and therefore the earnings process will be complete 
the expected period of performance was initially estimated to be a month period  starting in december  upon receipt of the million upfront payment  and ending in november during the year ended december   we extended the end of the revenue recognition period for the valeant agreement from november to november due to changes in the estimated timing of completion of certain research and development activities under the agreement 
this change in estimate was made on a prospective basis and resulted in a reduced periodic amount of revenue recognized in current and future periods 
if there are additional changes in the estimated timing of the completion of the final deliverable under the valeant agreement  the revenue recognition period will change on a prospective basis at such time the event occurs 
if we were to conclude significantly more time will be required to fulfill our contractual obligations  then we would further extend the revenue recognition period  which would further reduce the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
third party research agreements 
in addition to our own research and development resources  we may use unrelated third party vendors  including universities and independent research companies  to assist in our research and development activities 
these vendors provide a range of research and development services to us  including clinical and bio equivalency studies 
we generally sign agreements with these vendors which establish the terms of each study performed by them  including  among other things  the technical specifications of the study  the payment schedule  and timing of work to be performed 
third party researchers generally earn payments either upon the achievement of a milestone  or on a pre determined date  as specified in each study agreement 
we account for third party research and development expenses as they are incurred according to the terms and conditions of the respective agreement for each study performed  with an accrued expense at each balance sheet date for estimated fees and charges incurred by us  but not yet billed to us 
we monitor aggregate actual payments and compare them to the estimated provisions to assess the reasonableness of the accrued expense balance at each quarterly balance sheet date 
share based compensation 
we recognize the grant date fair value of each option and restricted share over its vesting period 
options and restricted shares granted under the plan vest over a three or four year period and have a term of ten years 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing model  wherein expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock  and of a peer group for the period of time our common stock was deregistered  over the period commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
we base the expected term calculation on the simplified method described in sab no 
 share based payment and sab no 
 share based payment  because it provides a reasonable estimate in comparison to our actual experience 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for an instrument with a maturity that is commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield is zero as we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
income taxes 
we are subject to us federal  state and local income taxes and taiwan roc income taxes 
we create a deferred tax asset  or a deferred tax liability  when we have temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values gaap and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
fair value of financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents include a portfolio of high quality credit securities  including us government sponsored entity securities  treasury bills  corporate bonds  short term commercial paper  and or high rated money market funds 
our entire portfolio matures in less than one year 
the carrying value of the portfolio approximated the market value at december  we carry our deferred compensation liability at fair value  based upon observable market values 
we had no debt outstanding as of december  our only remaining debt instrument at december  was our credit facility with wells fargo bank  na  which would be subject to variable interest rates and principal payments should we decide to borrow under it 
contingencies 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to loss contingencies  such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business  covering a wide range of matters  including  among others  patent litigation  shareholder lawsuits  and product and clinical trial liability 
in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  we record accrued loss contingencies when it is probable a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and we do not recognize gain contingencies until realized 
goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill and other intangibles  rather than recording periodic amortization of goodwill  goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
under fasb asc topic  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  then goodwill is considered not impaired  making further analysis not required 
we consider each of our global division and impax division operating segments to be a reporting unit  as this is the lowest level for each of which discrete financial information is available 
we attribute the entire carrying amount of goodwill to the global division 
we concluded the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of december  and  as the fair value of the global division exceeded its carrying value at each date 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
we estimate the fair value of the global division using a discounted cash flow model for both the reporting unit and the enterprise  as well as earnings and revenue multiples per common share outstanding for enterprise fair value 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform a review of our business operations to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  and thus indicate a potential impairment of the goodwill carrying value 
if such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred  we would perform an interim impairment analysis  which may include the preparation of a discounted cash flow model  or consultation with one or more valuation specialists  to analyze the impact  if any  on our assessment of the reporting unit s fair value 
to date  we have not deemed there to be any significant adverse changes in the legal  regulatory or business environment in which we conduct our operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview the following table sets forth our summarized  consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and year ended december december increase decrease in s total revenues gross profit income from operations income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to higher selling  general and administrative expenses  and partially offset by sales of impax labeled zomig tablets which we began selling in the three month period ended june   and sales of impax labeled zomig orally disintegrating tablets and nasal spray which we began selling in the three month period ended september   and lower income taxes 
we continued to earn significant revenues and gross profit from sales of our authorized generic adderall xr products and fenofibrate products during the year ended december  with respect to our authorized generic adderall xr products we have experienced significant declines in both market share and average net selling prices as a result of an unrelated pharmaceutical company receiving fda approval in june for a competitor product and beginning to market their product 
furthermore  we are dependent on a third party pharmaceutical company to supply us with the finished product we market and sell through our global division and we have experienced disruptions related to the supply of our authorized generic adderall xr from this third party pharmaceutical company 
with respect to our fenofibrate products  in october  a competitor product to our fenofibrate capsule product was approved for sale by the fda and began being marketed 
any significant diminution in the consolidated revenue and or gross profit of our authorized generic adderall xr and fenofibrate products  or any of our other products  due to competition and or product supply or any other reasons in future periods may materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in such future periods 
global division the following table sets forth results of operations for the global division for the years ended december  and year ended december december increase decrease in s revenues global product sales  net rx partner otc partner research partner total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development patent litigation selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations revenues total revenues for the global division for the year ended december   were million  a decrease of from  principally resulting from the decrease in global product sales  net and rx partner revenues  as discussed below 
global product sales  net  were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the same period in  primarily as a result of lower sales of our authorized generic adderall xr  which were partially offset by higher sales of our fenofibrate products 
with respect to our authorized generic adderall xr products we have experienced significant declines in both market share and average net selling prices as a result of an unrelated pharmaceutical company receiving fda approval in june for a competitor product and beginning to market such product 
with respect to sales of our fenofibrate products  while we experienced an increase resulting from overall market growth during the year ended december   a competitor product to our fenofibrate capsule product was approved for sale by the fda in october  and began being marketed 
rx partner revenues were million for  a decrease of over the prior year resulting from a profit share adjustment from teva under the teva agreement realized by us in the year ended december   for which there was no similar amount realized in  as well as lower sales of our generic products marketed through the teva agreement 
rx partner revenue also includes a charge of million in the year ended december  related to the voluntary market withdrawal of our buproprion xl mg products in for which there was no similar charge in the prior year 
otc partner revenues were million for the year ended december   with the increase over the prior year resulting from the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue related to our product marketed under our otc partner alliance agreement with pfizer 
for additional information on the otc partner agreement with pfizer  see item exhibits and financial statement schedules note alliance and collaboration agreements otc partner alliance agreement 
research partner revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the prior year 
the decrease of million resulted from the recognition of a million milestone payment in the prior year for which there was no such milestone payment recognized during the year ended december   and a million decrease related to the extension of the revenue recognition period for the valeant agreement from november to november which resulted from changes in the estimated timing of completion of certain research and development activities under the agreement 
cost of revenues cost of revenues was million for the year ended december  and million for the prior year  a decrease of million  primarily as a result of lower profit share expense related to sales of our authorized generic adderall xr 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total revenues  as compared to million  or approximately of total revenues  in the prior year 
gross profit in decreased compared to gross profit in the prior year period primarily as the result of lower sales of our authorized generic adderall xr products and lower profit share recognized under the teva agreement both as described above
