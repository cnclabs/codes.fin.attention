item a 
risk factors our substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flow is used to make interest payments could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of december   we had  million face value of outstanding indebtedness and our current debt service obligation for the next months is  million  which includes required interest payments of  million 
as of december   ceoc had  million face value of outstanding indebtedness including million owed to caesars entertainment  and ceoc s debt service obligation for the next months is  million  which includes required interest payments of  million 
in january and february  ceoc converted million aggregate principal amount of original maturity revolver commitments held by consenting lenders to term b loans  repaid million principal amount of term loans of extending lenders  terminated million principal amount of revolving commitments of extending lenders  and increased the amount of outstanding term b loans by million 
also in february  ceoc amended its credit facilities to  among other things i use the net cash proceeds of the february notes offering to repay a portion of ceoc existing term loans at par  with such repayment being applied first  to all outstanding b  b  and b term loans held by consenting lenders  second  to b and b term loans held by consenting lenders  in an amount up to of the principal amount of the b and b term loans  and third  if any proceeds remain outstanding  to outstanding term loans as ceoc elects in its discretion  ii obtain up to million of extended revolving facility commitments with a maturity of january   iii increase the accordion capacity under the credit facilities by an additional million  iv modify the calculation of the senior secured leverage ratio for purposes of the maintenance test under the credit facilities to exclude the february notes  and v modify certain other provisions of the credit facilities 
the full terms of these transactions are described in note  subsequent events  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the closing of the amendment transaction is subject to certain conditions  including required regulatory approvals 
our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital  capital expenditures  development projects  debt service requirements  strategic initiatives or other purposes  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments  including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions  could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our operations or business  make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions  developing new gaming facilities  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  affect our ability to renew gaming and other licenses  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets  and expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest 
despite our substantial indebtedness  we may still be able to incur significantly more debt 
this could intensify the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness at any time  and from time to time  including in the near future 
although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
for example  as of december   we had million of additional borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility with an additional million committed to back outstanding letters of credit  all of which is secured on a first priority basis 
none of our existing indebtedness limits the amount of debt that may be incurred by caesars entertainment 
our credit facilities allow for one or more future issuances of additional secured notes or loans  which may include  in each case  indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the obligations under the credit facilities and our first lien notes 
this indebtedness could be used for a variety of purposes  including financing capital expenditures  refinancing or repurchasing our outstanding indebtedness  including existing unsecured indebtedness  or for general corporate purposes 
we have raised and expect to continue to raise debt  including secured debt  to directly or indirectly refinance our outstanding unsecured debt on an opportunistic basis  as well as development and acquisition opportunities 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness  and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful 
if we are unable to satisfy or refinance our debt obligations as they come due  we cannot assure you that your investment in our company will retain any value 
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon  among other things our future financial and operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  and our future ability to borrow under our credit facilities  the availability of which depends on  among other things  our complying with the covenants in our credit facilities 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or unable to draw under our credit facilities or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
as of december   billion face value of our indebtedness is scheduled to mature in assuming the extension options with respect to the cmbs financing and phw las vegas senior secured loan are exercised  representing of the total face value of our debt 
for a discussion of our debt maturities  see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources guarantees of third party debt and other obligations and commitments contractual obligations 
we do not expect that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay this indebtedness  and we will have to seek a refinancing 
we cannot predict at this time whether we will be able to secure any such refinancing  even if market conditions and our financial condition improve between now and then 
even if refinancing alternatives were available to us  we may not find them suitable or at comparable interest rates to the indebtedness being refinanced 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from securing a refinancing on terms that are available to us at that time 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we would face substantial liquidity problems and would likely be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all 
furthermore  any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due 
we could also be required to reorganize our company in its entirety 
cec is pursuing a strategic transaction that contemplates the transfer of certain of its assets that are not part of the collateral package for the credit facilities or the secured notes issued by ceoc  including unencumbered assets of cec and unrestricted subsidiaries of ceoc  to a newly created entity  named caesars growth venture partners cgvp  which is anticipated to be controlled by common parties that control cec 
cgvp would be a growth oriented vehicle focused on projects that are complementary to cec existing properties 
we anticipate that cec would own a significant portion of cgvp equity interests and that subsidiaries of cec would manage new casino properties owned by cgvp 
we are pursuing this transaction because we believe it will improve our liquidity and credit profile  enhance our distribution network and provide additional support for potential new ventures 
it is currently contemplated that the following assets would be transferred i planet hollywood  ii investment in a casino project under development in baltimore  maryland  iii interest in a portion of the management fee revenues of the management companies for planet hollywood and the casino to be developed in baltimore  maryland  iv shares of caesars interactive entertainment  inc outstanding common stock held by hie holdings  inc  a subsidiary of cec  and v approximately billion face value of senior notes issued by ceoc held by harrah bc  inc it is anticipated the sponsors would participate in the transaction and that cec other shareholders would have the opportunity to participate on the same terms as the sponsors 
the form of consideration to cec is expected to be equity interests and cash  and any consideration to ceoc is expected to be cash  in each case at fair value 
there is no current intention that this transaction will involve cec outstanding cmbs financing 
there are no commitments with respect to any such transaction and there have been no agreements with respect to price or value 
the transfer of such assets would require the approval of regulators and other third parties  which we may not be able to obtain 
therefore  we cannot assure you that any such transaction will be entered into or consummated or  if consummated  describe the impact the transaction would have on us 
neither the sponsors nor any of their respective affiliates has any continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing 
even if we are able to refinance our debt  any refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
for example  the interest rates on our first and second lien notes are substantially higher than the interest rates under our credit facility 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations generally  and if we are unable to refinance our debt obligations that mature in or thereafter  we cannot assure you that our company will continue in its current state or that your investment in our company will retain any value 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our credit facilities  the cmbs mortgage loan and or related mezzanine loans the cmbs loans  the indentures governing most of our existing notes  the senior secured loans related to the development of octavius tower at caesars palace las vegas and project linq  the senior secured loan of phw las vegas  llc  the senior secured notes of chester downs and the senior secured loans related to the redevelopment of bill gamblin hall saloon contain  and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain  a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments  make certain investments  sell certain assets  create liens on certain assets  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
as a result of these covenants  we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business  and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs 
we have pledged and will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our credit facilities  our cmbs loans  our first lien notes  our second lien notes  the senior secured loan of phw las vegas  llc  the senior secured loan related to the developments of the octavius tower at caesars palace las vegas  bill gamblin hall saloon  and a retail  dining and entertainment corridor located between the quad resort casino and the flamingo las vegas on the las vegas strip project linq  or the senior secured notes of chester downs 
if any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 
under our credit facilities  we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios 
specifically  our credit facilities requires us to maintain a senior secured leverage ratio of no more than to  which is the ratio of our senior first priority secured debt to ltm adjusted ebitda pro forma ceoc restricted 
this ratio excludes up to  million of first priority senior secured notes and up to million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt of subsidiaries that are not wholly owned 
this ratio also reduces the amount of senior first priority secured debt by the amount of unrestricted cash on hand 
as of december   the senior secured leverage ratio was to in addition  under certain circumstances  our credit facilities allow us to apply cash contributions received by us as an increase to ltm adjusted ebitda pro forma ceoc restricted if we are unable to meet our senior secured leverage ratio 
many factors affect our continuing ability to comply with the covenant  including a changes in gaming trips  spend per trip and hotel metrics  which are correlated to a consumer recovery  b increases in cost savings actions  c asset sales  d issuing additional second lien or unsecured debt  e equity financings  f delays in investments in new developments  or g a combination thereof 
our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios 
a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or the existing agreements  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of any default under our credit facilities or our other indebtedness  the lenders thereunder will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us  could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees  to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit  or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings 
such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under our credit facilities  our cmbs loans and our first and second lien notes could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if the indebtedness under our first and second lien notes  credit facilities  cmbs loans or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
we are controlled by the sponsors  whose interests may not be aligned with ours 
hamlet holdings  the members of which are comprised of an equal number of individuals affiliated with each of the sponsors  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock pursuant to an irrevocable proxy providing hamlet holdings with sole voting and sole dispositive power over those shares 
as a result  the sponsors have the power to elect all of our directors 
therefore  the sponsors have the ability to vote on any transaction that requires the approval of our board or our stockholders  including the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets 
the interests of the sponsors could conflict with or differ from the interests of other holders of our securities 
for example  the concentration of ownership held by the sponsors could delay  defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger  takeover or other business combination which another stockholder may otherwise view favorably 
additionally  the sponsors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies it holds  and may from time to time in the future acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours 
one or both of the sponsors may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business  and  as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by funds affiliated with the sponsors or their co investors could cause our stock price to decline 
so long as hamlet holdings continues to hold the irrevocable proxy  they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions 
in addition  we have an executive committee that serves at the discretion of our board and is authorized to take such actions as it reasonably determines appropriate 
currently  the executive committee may act by a majority of its members  provided that at least one member affiliated with tpg and apollo must approve any action of the executive committee 
the downturn in the national economy over the past few years  the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets  and adverse changes in the global economy could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access financing 
the severe economic downturn over the past few years and adverse conditions in the local  regional  national and global markets have negatively affected our operations  and may continue to negatively affect our operations in the future 
during periods of economic contraction such as recently experienced  our revenues may decrease while most of our costs remain fixed and some costs even increase  resulting in decreased earnings 
gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures and participation in such activities may decline during economic downturns  during which consumers generally earn less disposable income 
for example  key determinants of our revenues and operating performance include hotel average daily rate adr  number of gaming trips and average spend per trip by our customers 
given that was the peak year for our financial performance and the gaming industry in the united states in general  we may not attain those financial levels in the near term  or at all 
if we fail to increase adr or any other similar metric in the near term  our revenues may not increase and  as a result  we may not be able to pay down our existing debt  fund our operations  fund planned capital expenditures or achieve expected growth rates  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in our gaming operations and related facilities  as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn 
furthermore  other uncertainties  including national and global economic conditions  terrorist attacks or other global events  could adversely affect consumer spending and adversely affect our operations 
we may not realize any or all of our projected cost savings  which would have the effect of reducing our ltm adjusted ebitda pro forma  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations and negatively impact our covenant calculation and could have a negative effect on our stock price 
beginning in the third quarter of  we initiated a company wide cost savings plan in an effort to align our expenses with current revenue levels 
in addition  we embarked on project renewal in the fourth quarter of to identify the optimum way of structuring our business given our breadth and scale of product offerings 
while these efforts have allowed us to realize substantial savings since we initiated our cost savings plan  our continued reduction efforts may fail to achieve similar or continued savings 
although we believe  as of december   once fully implemented  these cost savings programs will produce additional estimated annual cost savings of million we may not realize some or all of these projected savings without impacting our revenues 
our cost savings plans are intended to increase our effectiveness and efficiency in our operations without impacting our revenues and margins 
our cost savings plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time  and  therefore  our actual savings may differ materially from what we anticipate 
for example  cutting advertising or marketing expenses may have an unintended negative affect on our revenues 
in addition  our expected savings from procurement of goods may be affected by unexpected increases in the cost of raw materials 
furthermore  because we use our projected yet to be realized cost savings as a pro forma adjustment to calculate our ltm adjusted ebitda pro forma  our actual adjusted ebitda would be reduced to the extent of the cost savings we do not achieve 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies  the enforcement of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty 
regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any one of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  revenues and income from operations were negatively impacted during july in atlantic city by a three day government imposed casino shutdown 
furthermore  in many jurisdictions where we operate  licenses are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time 
for example  in iowa  our ability to continue our gaming operations is subject to a referendum every eight years or at any time upon petition of the voters in the county in which we operate  the most recent referendum which approved our ability to continue to operate our casinos occurred in november in maryland  we will have to reapply for our license in years 
there can be no assurance that continued gaming activity will be approved in any referendum in the future 
if we do not obtain the requisite approval in any future referendum  we will not be able to operate our gaming operations in iowa  which would negatively impact our future performance 
from time to time  individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums  such as bans on smoking in casinos and other entertainment and dining facilities  which could adversely impact our operations 
for example  the city council of atlantic city passed an ordinance in requiring that we segregate at least of the casino gaming floor as a nonsmoking area  leaving no more than of the casino gaming floor as a smoking area 
illinois also passed the smoke free illinois act which became effective january   and bans smoking in nearly all public places  including bars  restaurants  work places  schools and casinos 
the act also bans smoking within feet of any entrance  window or air intake area of these public places 
these smoking bans have adversely affected revenues and operating results at our properties 
the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted  though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance 
the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  including increases in tax rates  which would affect the industry 
if adopted  such changes could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stockholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation and if a stockholder is found unsuitable by the gaming authority  that stockholder would not be able to beneficially own our common stock directly or indirectly 
in many jurisdictions  gaming laws can require any of our stockholders to file an application  be investigated  and qualify or have his  her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities 
gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable 
subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements  the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit  condition  restrict  revoke or suspend any license  registration  finding of suitability or approval  or fine any person licensed  registered or found suitable or approved  for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities 
for additional information on the criteria used in making determinations regarding suitability  see governmental regulation 
for example  under nevada gaming laws  each person who acquires  directly or indirectly  beneficial ownership of any voting security  or beneficial or record ownership of any non voting security or any debt security  in a public corporation which is registered with the nevada gaming commission  or the gaming commission  may be required to be found suitable if the gaming commission has reason to believe that his or her acquisition of that ownership  or his or her continued ownership in general  would be inconsistent with the declared public policy of nevada  in the sole discretion of the gaming commission 
any person required by the gaming commission to be found suitable shall apply for a finding of suitability within days after the gaming commission request that he or she should do so and  together with his or her application for suitability  deposit with the nevada gaming control board  or the control board  a sum of money which  in the sole discretion of the control board  will be adequate to pay the anticipated costs and charges incurred in the investigation and processing of that application for suitability  and deposit such additional sums as are required by the control board to pay final costs and charges 
additionally  under ohio law  an institutional investor  which is broadly defined and includes any corporation that holds any amount of our stock  will be required to apply for and obtain a waiver of suitability determination 
furthermore  any person required by a gaming authority to be found suitable  who is found unsuitable by the gaming authority  may not hold directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any nonvoting security or any debt security of any public corporation which is registered with the gaming authority beyond the time prescribed by the gaming authority 
a violation of the foregoing may constitute a criminal offense 
a finding of unsuitability by a particular gaming authority impacts that person ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in that particular jurisdiction and could impact the person ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in other jurisdictions 
many jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and  in some jurisdictions  non voting securities  typically  to report the acquisition to gaming authorities  and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability  subject to limited exceptions for institutional investors that hold a company voting securities for investment purposes only 
some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest 
in indiana  for example  a person may not have an ownership interest in more than two indiana riverboat owner licenses 
if we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors  our profits will decline 
the gaming industry is highly competitive and our competitors vary considerably in size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing  and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent  and geographic diversity 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation areas  and with various other entertainment businesses 
our competitors in each market that we participate may have substantially greater financial  marketing  or other resources than we do  and there can be no assurance that they will not  in the future  engage in aggressive pricing action to compete with us 
although we believe we are currently able to compete effectively in each of the various markets in which we participate  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so or that we will be capable of maintaining or further increasing our current market share 
our failure to compete successfully in our various markets could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
in recent years  many casino operators have been reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers or to gain market share  thereby increasing competition in those markets 
as companies have completed new expansion projects  supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets  including las vegas  our largest market  and competition has increased significantly 
for example  citycenter  a large development of resorts and residences  opened in december in las vegas  and revel  a resort and casino in atlantic city  opened in may the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate  and this intense competition is expected to continue 
these competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance in certain markets  including atlantic city 
in particular  our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in nevada  new jersey  new york  connecticut  pennsylvania  mississippi  missouri  maryland  michigan  indiana  iowa  kansas  illinois  ohio  louisiana  ontario  south africa  uruguay  united kingdom  egypt  and or other projects not yet announced which may be competitive in the other markets where we operate or intend to operate 
several states  such as kentucky  texas and indian tribes are also considering enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino like operations in their jurisdictions 
in addition  our operations located in new jersey may be adversely impacted by the expansion of gaming in maryland  new york and pennsylvania  and our operations located in nevada may be adversely impacted by the expansion of gaming in california  respectively 
use of the caesars brand name  or any of our other brands  by entities other than us could damage the brands and our operations and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our caesars brand remains the most recognized casino brand in the world and our operations benefit from the global recognition and reputation generated by our brands 
generally and through caesars global living  we are actively pursuing gaming and non gaming management  branding  and development opportunities in asia and other parts of the world where our brands and reputation are already well recognized assets 
in september  we announced a management and branding agreement for a non gaming development  whose equity will be provided by a third party  which will be called caesars palace longmu bay 
in addition  we will continue to expand our world series of poker tournaments to international jurisdictions where we believe there is a likelihood of legalization of online gaming  in order to grow the brand s awareness 
in connection with such opportunities  we intend to grant third parties licenses to use our brands 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the management or the enforcement of the caesars and the world series of poker brand names  or any of our other brands  by third parties outside of our exclusive control 
any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business 
the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy  and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success 
for example  we own and manage the world series of poker tournaments  and we license trademarks for a variety of products and businesses related to this brand 
while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property  we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws 
we file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate 
we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  parties may infringe our trademarks and use information that we regard as proprietary and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource 
we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others 
the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and our market acceptance  competitive advantages or goodwill  which could adversely affect our business 
we extend credit to a portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players 
we conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties 
any such credit we extend is unsecured 
table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players  and high stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts 
high end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming  and variances in win loss results attributable to high end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter 
we extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant  in the opinion of management  an extension of credit 
these large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible 
while gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument  including what is commonly referred to as a marker  and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis and judgments in such jurisdictions on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution  other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy 
although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment  judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations 
the acquisition  development and construction of new hotels  casinos and gaming and non gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations due to various factors including delays  cost overruns and other uncertainties 
we intend to develop  construct and open or acquire new hotels  casinos and other gaming venues  as well as develop and manage non gaming venues  in response to opportunities that may arise 
future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments  the incurrence of additional debt  guarantees of third party debt  the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  which could have an adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
the development and construction of new hotels  casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones  such as our recent construction of the octavius tower and redevelopment of the nobu tower at caesars palace in las vegas  the planned redevelopment of bill gamblin hall in las vegas  the planned construction of horseshoe baltimore as well as the development and construction of non gaming venues such as project linq in las vegas and caesars palace longmu bay in china  are susceptible to various risks and uncertainties  such as the existence of acceptable market conditions and demand for the completed project  general construction risks  including cost overruns  change orders and plan or specification modification  shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  labor disputes  unforeseen environmental  engineering or geological problems  work stoppages  fire and other natural disasters  construction scheduling problems  and weather interferences  changes and concessions required by governmental or regulatory authorities  the ability to finance the projects  especially in light of our substantial indebtedness  delays in obtaining  or inability to obtain  all licenses  permits and authorizations required to complete and or operate the project  and disruption of our existing operations and facilities 
moreover  our development and expansion projects are sometimes jointly pursued with third parties or by licensing our brands to third parties 
these joint development  expansion projects or license agreements are subject to risks  in addition to those disclosed above  as they are dependent on our ability to reach and maintain agreements with third parties 
for example  we made a bid with rock gaming llc and other local investors for a video lottery terminal facility in suffolk county massachusetts and we can give no assurances that the bid will be awarded to us  that we will reach definitive agreements with the other parties that comprise the bid  or that the development project will be undertaken 
our failure to complete any new development or expansion project  or consummate any joint development  expansion projects or projects where we license our brands  as planned  on schedule  within budget or in a manner that generates anticipated profits  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we may sell or divest different properties or assets as a result of our evaluation of our portfolio of businesses 
such sales or divestitures would affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
from time to time  we evaluate our properties and our portfolio of businesses and may  as a result  sell or attempt to sell  divest or spin off different properties or assets 
for example  in may  we announced an agreement to sell our harrah st 
louis property and  in november  we completed the sale 
we plan to dispose of the subsidiaries that hold our land concession in macau and in the fourth quarter  began discussions with interested investors regarding sale of those entities 
these sales or divestitures affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
divestitures have inherent risks  including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals  the risk of lower than expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses  and potential post closing claims for indemnification 
in addition  current economic conditions and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 
expected costs savings  which are offset by revenue losses from divested properties  may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to our fixed cost structure 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of current or potential future acquisitions 
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the businesses of such acquired company with our businesses 
the combination of two independent companies is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
this process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies  and may not result in the full benefits expected 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies  including our recent acquisitions of planet hollywood in las vegas and playtika ltd  include  among others coordinating marketing functions  undisclosed liabilities  unanticipated issues in integrating information  communications and other systems  unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing  logistics  marketing and administration methods  retaining key employees  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
we may be unable to realize in whole or in part the benefits anticipated for any current or future acquisitions 
the risks associated with our international operations could reduce our profits 
some of our properties are located outside the united states  and our acquisition of london clubs has increased the percentage of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states 
international operations are subject to inherent risks including political and economic instability  variation in local economies  currency fluctuation  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  trade barriers  and burden of complying with a variety of international laws 
for example  the political instability in egypt due to the uprising in january has negatively affected our properties there 
any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or other similar laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us 
we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states  which exposes us to complex foreign and us regulations inherent in doing business cross border and in each of the countries in which it transacts business 
we are subject to regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anti corruption laws that generally prohibit us companies and their intermediaries from offering  promising  authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
violations of the fcpa and other anti corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and us department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the fcpa 
internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees  contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law 
if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations  we may face investigations  prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties  administrative remedies and criminal sanctions 
any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions 
we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti money laundering regulations 
any violation of anti money laundering laws or regulations by any of our resorts could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the leadership of our chief executive officer  mr 
loveman  and other executive officers has been a critical element of our success 
the death or disability of mr 
loveman or other extended or permanent loss of his services  or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could also adversely affect us 
we are not protected by key man or similar life insurance covering members of our senior management 
we have employment agreements with our executive officers  but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate employees  we may not be able to compete effectively and will not be able to expand our business 
our success and ability to grow are dependent  in part  on our ability to hire  retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people  with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business  in many locations around the world 
competition for highly qualified  specialized technical and managerial  and particularly consulting  personnel is intense 
recruiting  training  retention and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources 
additionally  our substantial indebtedness and the recent downturn in the gaming  travel and leisure sectors have made recruiting executives to our business more difficult 
the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us 
work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits 
some of our employees are represented by labor unions 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
from time to time  we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non union employees 
while these efforts have achieved only limited success to date  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future 
there has been a trend towards unionization for employees in atlantic city and las vegas 
the impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our profits 
acts of terrorism and war  natural disasters and severe weather may negatively impact our future profits 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties 
for example  a substantial number of our customers for our properties in las vegas use air travel 
on september   acts of terrorism occurred in new york city  pennsylvania and washington  dc as a result of these terrorist acts  domestic and international travel was severely disrupted  which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in las vegas 
we cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act  security alerts or war  uprisings  or hostilities in places such as iraq and afghanistan  other countries throughout the world will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results 
for example  our operations in cairo  egypt were negatively affected from the uprising there in january as a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future  premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased  and some types of insurance are no longer available 
given current conditions in the global insurance markets  we are substantially underinsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
if any such event were to affect our properties  we would likely be adversely impacted 
in addition  natural and man made disasters such as major fires  floods  hurricanes  earthquakes and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results 
for example  four of our properties in louisiana and mississippi were closed for an extended period of time due to the damage sustained from hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september  respectively 
such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities 
if any such event were to affect our properties  we would likely be adversely impacted 
seven of our properties were closed during the first half of due to flooding and severe weather conditions 
additionally  in august  our casinos in atlantic city were closed during a busy summer weekend due to hurricane irene 
our properties in atlantic city were closed for five days and our property in philadelphia was closed for two days in october and november due to hurricane sandy 
further  certain of these properties sustained minor damage from the storm  which totaled approximately million 
in addition  hurricane sandy significantly affected atlantic city and surrounding areas in the northeast through flooding  wind and other water damage to properties and infrastructure  loss of power to residences and businesses and by creating a fuel shortage in new jersey and surrounding areas 
the regional storm damage in the northeast is likely to deter customers from visiting atlantic city and our atlantic city properties for some period of time 
our covered losses from property damage and business interruption did not exceed our deductible on this storm 
our results of operations in this region were significantly affected in the fourth quarter of  with an estimated reduction in revenues of between million and million and a related reduction in operating income of between million and million 
in most cases  we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster  but in many cases it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts 
although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster  the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds  if any  is out of our control 
in some cases  however  we may receive no proceeds from insurance  such as our august and october and november closings in atlantic city 
additionally  a natural disaster affecting one or more of our properties may affect the level and cost of insurance coverage we may be able to obtain in the future  which may adversely affect our financial position 
as our operations depend in part on our customers ability to travel  severe or inclement weather can also have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that  if adversely adjudicated or settled  could impact our financial condition 
from time to time  we are defendants in various lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business 
the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers  past and present employees  competitors  business partners  indian tribes and others in the ordinary course of business 
as with all legal proceedings  no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and in general  legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming 
for example  we may have potential liability arising from a class action lawsuit against hilton hotels corporation relating to employee benefit obligations 
we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits  which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur impairments to goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  or long lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits 
each year  we perform a preliminary annual assessment of goodwill as of september  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
for our preliminary assessment  we determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit as a function  or multiple  of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  combined with estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants  giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general 
we also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other non operating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at september both ebitda multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value and buy or sell businesses in our industry 
in the fourth quarter  we finalize our assessment of goodwill once we complete our fair value analysis for reporting units where a step two impairment test is required 
each year  we perform an annual impairment assessment of other non amortizing intangible assets as of september  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
we determine the estimated fair value of our non amortizing intangible assets by primarily using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
when performing this assessment  we consider current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic  legal  and regulatory factors 
we are dependent upon our properties for future cash flows and our continued success depends on our ability to draw customers to our properties 
significant negative industry or economic trends  reduced estimates of future cash flows  disruptions to our business  slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business have resulted in impairment charges during the years ended december    and  and  if one or more of such events occurs in the future  additional impairment charges may be required in future periods 
if we are required to record additional impairment charges  this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we may be required to pay our future tax obligation on our deferred cancellation of debt income 
under the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the arra  we received temporary federal tax relief under the delayed recognition of cancellation of debt income  or codi  rules 
the arra contains a provision that allows for a deferral for tax purposes of codi for debt reacquired in and  followed by recognition of codi ratably from through in connection with the debt that we reacquired in and  we have deferred related codi of billion for tax purposes net of original issue discount oid interest expense  some of which must also be deferred to through under the arra 
we are required to include one fifth of the deferred codi  net of deferred and regularly scheduled oid  in taxable income each year from through alternatively  the deferred codi  net of deferred oid  could be accelerated into taxable income in a year an impairment transaction occurs 
to the extent that our federal taxable income exceeds our available federal net operating loss carry forwards in those years  we will have a cash tax obligation 
our tax obligations related to codi could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our cash flows as a result of tax payments 
for more information on the debt that we reacquired in and  see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation other factors affecting net income 
our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results 
we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and  therefore  higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
accordingly  increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results 
additionally  higher electricity and gasoline prices which affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues 
we may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at up stream utility providers  as we could experience potentially higher utility  fuel  and transportation costs 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer 
in addition  our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future 
we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our properties in operation as well as those in the course of construction with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary in their breadth and scope 
market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates 
certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and floods  or terrorist acts  or certain liabilities may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance 
as a result  we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels 
in addition  in the event of a substantial loss  the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured 
as a result  we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property  and we could remain obligated for debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers personal information could materially harm our reputation and business 
we collect and store confidential  personal information relating to our customers for various business purposes  including marketing and financial purposes  and credit card information for processing payments 
for example  we handle  collect and store personal information in connection with our customers staying at our hotels and enrolling in our total rewards program 
we may share this personal and confidential information with vendors or other third parties in connection with processing of transactions  operating certain aspects of our business or for marketing purposes 
our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws and regulations as well as the applicable laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate 
privacy law is an area that changes often and varies significantly by jurisdiction 
we may incur significant costs in order to ensure compliance with the various applicable privacy requirements 
in addition  privacy laws and regulations may limit our ability to market to our customers 
we assess and monitor the security of collection  storage and transmission of customer information on an ongoing basis 
we utilize commercially available software and technologies to monitor  assess and secure our network 
further  the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions  and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves  all of which can put payment card data at risk  are determined and controlled by the payment card industry  not us 
although we have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers confidential personal information  our network and other systems and those of third parties  such as service providers  could be compromised by a third party breach of our system security or that of a third party provider or as a result by purposeful or accidental actions of third parties  our employees or those employees of a third party 
advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology  new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach 
as a result of any security breach  customer information or other proprietary data may be accessed or transmitted by or to a third party 
despite these measures  there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information 
any loss  disclosure or misappropriation of  or access to  customers or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings  including regulatory investigations and actions  or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws  including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information  which could disrupt our operations  damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers  financial institutions  regulators  payment card associations  employees and other persons  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our obligation to fund multi employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 
we contribute to and participate in various multi employer pension plans for employees represented by certain unions 
we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements 
we do not administer these plans and  generally  are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans 
the pension protection act enacted in  or the ppa  requires under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios 
based on the information available to us  some of the multi employer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa 
we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding  if any  we may be required to make to these plans 
however  plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 
furthermore  under current law  upon the termination of a multi employer pension plan  or in the event of a withdrawal by us  which we consider from time to time  or a mass withdrawal or insolvency of contributing employers  we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan unfunded vested liabilities 
any termination of a multi employer plan  or mass withdrawal or insolvency of contributing employers  could require us to contribute an amount under a plan of rehabilitation or surcharge assessment that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
an active trading market for our common stock may not develop 
prior to our listing in february  there was no public market for our common stock 
we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that market might become 
our shares may be less liquid than the shares of other newly public companies and there may be imbalances between supply and demand for our shares 
as a result  our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance 
if an active trading market does not develop  owners of our common stock may have difficulty selling any of our common stock 
future sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock 
future sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities 
as of march   there were  shares outstanding  all of which are the same class of voting common stock 
all of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be eligible for resale under rule or rule of the securities act of  as amended securities act  subject to volume limitations  applicable holding period requirements or other contractual restrictions 
the sponsors have the ability to cause us to register the resale of its shares  and our management members who hold shares will have the ability to include their shares in such registration 
in connection with the co investors transaction  we filed a shelf prospectus to register  shares of our common stock for resale on a continuous basis by the participating co investors  subject to the lockup agreements described herein 
we may issue shares of common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments or for any other reason that our board of directors deems advisable 
if any such acquisition or investment is significant  the number of shares of our common stock  or the number or aggregate principal amount  as the case may be  of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial 
we may also grant registration rights covering those shares of common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or other securities or the effect  if any  that future issuances and sales of our common stock or other securities  including future sales by the sponsors  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares of common stock issued in connection with an acquisition  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
the price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent a holder of our common stock from being able to sell their shares 
the market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons  including our operating and financial performance and prospects  our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry  conditions that impact demand for our products and services  the public reaction to our press releases  other public announcements and filings with the sec  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock  market and industry perception of our success  or lack thereof  in pursuing our growth strategy  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  changes in government and environmental regulation  including gaming taxes  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  arrival and departure of key personnel  changes in our capital structure  sales of common stock by us or members of our management team  the expiration of contractual lockup agreements  and changes in general market  economic and political conditions in the united states and global economies or financial markets  including those resulting from natural disasters  terrorist attacks  acts of war and responses to such events 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies  including companies in the gaming  lodging  hospitality and entertainment industries 
the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies 
hence  the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us  and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price 
because we have not paid dividends since the acquisition and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  holders of our common stock should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our common stock 
we have no present plans to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and  for the foreseeable future  intend to retain all of our earnings for use in our business 
the declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our board and will be dependent on our earnings  financial condition and capital requirements  as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our board 
we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nasdaq rules and  as a result  will qualify for  and intend to rely on  exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 
hamlet holdings controls a majority of our voting common stock 
as a result  we are a controlled company within the meaning of nasdaq corporate governance standards 
under the nasdaq rules  a company of which more than of the voting power is held by an individual  group or another company is a controlled company and we have elected not to comply with certain nasdaq corporate governance requirements  including the requirement that a majority of the board consists of independent directors  the requirement that we have a nominating corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors  the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors  and the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating corporate governance and compensation committees 
as a result of these exemptions  we do not have a majority of independent directors nor do our nominating corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors and we are not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the nominating corporate governance and compensation committees 
accordingly  a holder of our common stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nasdaq corporate governance requirements 
our bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of our bylaws and our certificate of incorporation may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors 
these provisions include establishing a classified board of directors  establishing limitations on the removal of directors  permitting only an affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the board to fix the number of directors  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  empowering only the board to fill any vacancy on the board  whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise  authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent if less than of our outstanding common stock is controlled by the sponsors  prohibiting amendments to the bylaws without the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the board or the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the total voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote  prohibiting amendments to the certificate of incorporation relating to stockholder meetings  amendments to the bylaws or certificate of incorporation  or the election or classification of the board without the affirmative vote of two thirds of the shares entitled to vote on any matter  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of us 
our board has the authority to cause us to issue  without any further vote or action by the stockholders  shares of preferred stock  par value per share  in one or more series  to designate the number of shares constituting any series  and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof  including dividend rights  voting rights  rights and terms of redemption  redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders  even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares 
together  these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock 
furthermore  the existence of the foregoing provisions  as well as the significant common stock controlled by hamlet holdings  could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
they could also deter potential acquirers of our company  thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition

m we closed this casino on march  item legal proceedings litigation the supreme court of nevada decided in early that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals is exempt from use tax 
previously  such purchases were subject to use tax and the company has claimed  but not recognized into earnings  a use tax refund totaling million  plus interest  as a result of the decision 
in early  the nevada department of taxation department audited our refund claim  but has taken the position that those same purchases are now subject to sales tax  therefore  they subsequently issued a sales tax assessment totaling million plus interest after application of our refund on use tax 
on october   the administrative law judge alj issued a decision and ruled in our favor on a number of key issues  including that complimentary employee meals are not subject to sales tax 
although both the company and the nevada department of taxation filed an appeal of the decision with the nevada tax commission commission  the case was returned to the alj for further factual development 
the alj issued a second decision on march   reversing her previous  partially favorable ruling relating to the taxability of complimentary employee meals and affirmed the taxability of complimentary meals but limited the entire sales tax assessment to the amount of the company use tax refund claims resulting in no use tax refund awarded but no sales tax amounts due 
the alj decision was affirmed in the commission hearing on june  and the commission final decision was issued on july  we filed a petition for judicial review with the district court on august  on march   the district court judge ruled that employee meals are not subject to sales tax but affirmed the application of sales tax to complimentary patron meals 
additionally  the judge ordered a refund of the portion of our use tax refund claims filed prior to october  without any offsetting sales tax assessments relating to complimentary patron meals for those periods 
we expect that the district court decision will be appealed to the nevada supreme court 
subsequent to a written commission decision issued in february for another gaming company  the department has issued draft regulations requiring the collection of sales tax on the retail value of complimentary meals and the cost of employee meals 
although the commission approved the regulation on june   there are several additional approvals required  including by the legislative commission  before the regulation is finalized 
on june   the department issued additional guidance regarding the payment of sales tax on complimentary and employee meals  maintaining that meals are taxable as of february  but that the payment of the tax is due  without penalty or interest  at the earlier of a one month after approval of the regulation by the legislative commission  b one month after a nevada supreme court decision  c the effective date of any legislation or d june  the department stated that it provided this additional guidance regarding the deferral of payment requirements because the legislative commission has not had the opportunity to approve the regulation and because there are several ongoing appeals that have not been heard by the tax commission and the nevada supreme court 
as of december  we had accrued million in sales tax accruals on complementary meals 
due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of our pending litigation and or the final approval and form of the pending regulation  we continue to record sales tax reserves against loss on this matter 
the company is party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not expect the outcome of any pending litigation to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
