item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview national healthcare corporation  which we also refer to as nhc or the company  is a leading provider of long term health care services 
at december  we operate or manage long term health care centers with  beds in states and provide various services in one additional state 
these operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries 
we provide long term health care services to patients in a variety of settings including long term nursing centers  managed care specialty units  sub acute care units  alzheimer care units  assisted living centers  independent living centers  and homecare programs 
we also have a non controlling ownership interest in a hospice care business that services nhc owned health care centers and others 
in addition  we provide management services  accounting services and insurance services to third party owners of long term health care centers 
executive summary earnings to monitor our earnings  we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor  census  and the composition of revenues 
inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline 
medicare reimbursement rate changes in july  cms released its skilled nursing facility pps update for the fiscal year  which began october  the notice provides a rate update  which reflects a market basket increase that is reduced under the aca by a multifactor productivity adjustment 
cms estimates the update will increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year by million compared to fiscal year levels 
the notice also provides an update to certain fiscal year policy changes involving recalibration of the parity adjustment  reallocation of group therapy time  and changes to the mds patient assessment instrument 
the effect of the pps rate update on our revenues is dependent upon our census and the mix of our patients at the pps pay rates 
cms final rule  which began october   provided for a net reduction in pps payments to skilled nursing facilities 
the fiscal year rule also adjusted the method by which group therapy is counted for reimbursement purposes  and changes the timing in which patients who received therapy must be reassessed for purposes of determining their rug category 
we anticipated that  assuming other factors remained constant  cms reduced reimbursement rates for its fiscal year would have a significant and adverse effect on our results of operations when compared to the periods in cms fiscal year we estimated the resulting decrease in revenue would be approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
furthermore  changes in government requirements for providing therapy services were estimated to increase our operating costs by approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
our results differed from our estimates because of an improved patient mix and because of the implementation of cost saving measures 
with the passing of the american taxpayer relief act of  the scheduled spending cuts of not more than for medicare skilled nursing facility payments were delayed until march  the spending cuts will go into effect unless a new law is enacted that specifically addresses these cuts 
we are unable to predict the financial impact of sequestration  if enacted  or other spending cuts congress may implement 
development and growth we are undertaking to expand our long term care operations while protecting our existing operations and markets

this facility is expected to be completed during the third quarter of also  in november  we began construction on a bed skilled nursing addition to nhc lexington in lexington  south carolina 
in  we expect to begin construction of a bed skilled nursing facility in sumner county  tennessee 
in addition  we engaged in a joint venture with rsf partners  inc  and flournoy development  inc to build and operate an unit assisted living community camellia walk in augusta  georgia 
camellia walk should begin construction in and open in the first quarter of we also entered into a joint venture with reliant healthcare  llc to develop and operate a bed psychiatric hospital focusing on geriatric care in osage beach  missouri 
this project is projected to open in during we will also apply for certificates of need for additional beds in our markets and also evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building private pay health care centers or by the purchase of existing health care centers 
accrued risk reserves our accrued professional liability reserves  workers compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled  at december  and are a primary area of management focus 
we have set aside restricted cash and marketable securities to fund our professional liability and workers compensation reserves 
as to exposure for professional liability claims  we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure  including in house acquired pressure ulcers  significant weight loss and numbers of falls 
these programs for certification  which we regularly modify and improve  have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents 
our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition third party payors approximately of our net patient revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries or their agents 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our original estimates of reimbursements and subsequent revisions are reflected in operations in the period in which the revisions are made often due to final determination or the period of payment no longer being subject to audit or review 
we have made provisions of approximately  as of december  for various medicare and medicaid current and prior year cost reports and claims reviews 
revenue recognition private pay for private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities  we bill room and board in advance for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed 
charges for ancillary  pharmacy  therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services  however  all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
revenue recognition subordination of fees and uncertain collections we provide management services to certain long term care facilities and to others we provide accounting and financial services 
we generally charge to of net revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services 
our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided 
however  under the terms of our management contracts  payments for our management services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long term care center being managed 
furthermore  for certain of the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that collection is not reasonably assured  our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which the amounts are realized 
we may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the centers or proceeds from the sale of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees 
there can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur 
the realization of such previously unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we agree to subordinate our fees to the other expenses of a managed center because we believe we know how to improve the quality of patient services and finances of a long term care center and because subordinating our fees demonstrates to the owner and employees of the managed center how confident we are of the impact we can have in making the center operations successful 
we may continue to provide services to certain managed centers despite not being fully paid currently so that we may be able to collect unpaid fees in the future from improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit 
also  we may benefit from providing other ancillary services to the managed center 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements regarding our relationships with national  nhi  and the recognition of management fees from long term care centers owned by third parties 
accrued risk reserves we are principally self insured for risks related to employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
our accrued risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self insured risks associated with employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
the accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims 
our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to estimate our exposure for claims obligations for both asserted and unasserted claims 
our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims paid 
we reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis 
professional liability remains an area of particular concern to us 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are defendants in such claims inclusive of years through it remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
it is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we maintain insurance coverage for incidents occurring in all providers owned or leased by us  and most providers managed by us 
the coverages include both primary policies and excess policies 
in all years  settlements  if any  in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us 
credit losses certain of our accounts receivable from private paying patients and certain of our notes receivable are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected accounts receivable credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
we continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with asc topic  receivables 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of the receivables changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these balances 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
uncertain tax positions uncertain tax positions may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment 
we believe we have adequate provisions for our uncertain tax positions including related penalties and interest 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with limited need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

approximately of our net patient revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
as discussed above in the application of critical accounting policies section  amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
see application of critical accounting policies for discussion of the effects that this revenue concentration and the uncertainties related to such revenues have on our revenue recognition policies 
government program financial changes cost containment will continue to be a priority for federal and state governments for health care services  including the types of services we provide 
government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid prescribe  by law  the billing methods and amounts that health care providers may charge and be reimbursed to care for patients covered by these programs 
congress has passed a number of laws that have effected major changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the balanced budget act of sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  reducing federal spending on medicare and medicaid to various providers 
the balanced budget act of defined the medicare prospective payment system pps and this system has subsequently been refined in    and federal health care reform in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca or  commonly  aca and the health care and education reconciliation act of hcera  which represents significant changes to the current us health care system collectively the acts 
the primary goals of the acts are to expand coverage to americans without health insurance  reform the delivery system to improve quality and drive efficiency  and to lower the overall costs of providing health care 
the timeline of the enacted provisions span over several years some of the provisions were effective immediately in and others will be phased in through the us supreme court has since issued its ruling on the constitutionality of a key provision in the aca  which is the requirement that every american maintain a minimum level of health coverage or pay a penalty beginning in the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate  holding that the penalty for not doing so could reasonably be interpreted as a tax  which the constitution permits 
the ruling also permits the federal government to pursue a broad expansion of the medicaid program  but the ruling gives the states the maximum flexibility on whether to do so 
in preparation for the medicaid coverage expansion to occur in  the current administration is expected to release a host of regulations and an array of new taxes and fees 
it is uncertain at this time the effect the acts  their modifications  or medicaid expansion will have on our future results of operations or cash flows 
in august and pursuant to the budget control act of  congress created a member bipartisan committee called the joint select committee on deficit reduction  or the joint committee 
the joint committee was charged with issuing a formal recommendation by november  on how to reduce the federal deficit by at least trillion over the next ten years 
the committee concluded their work in november and was not able to reach a bipartisan agreement before the committee s deadline period 
this failure by the committee is scheduled to trigger automatic reductions known as sequestration in discretionary and mandatory spending starting in  including reductions of not more than to payments to medicare providers 
on january   congress passed the american taxpayer relief act of to avert the so called fiscal cliff 
among the legislation was the delay of sequestration and the automatic medicare spending cuts scheduled to begin january  this current legislation delays sequestration for two months until march  the spending cuts will go into effect unless a new law is enacted that specifically addresses these cuts 
we are unable to predict the financial impact of sequestration  if enacted  or other spending cuts congress may implement 
however  such impact may be adverse and material to our future results of operations and cash flows 
medicare skilled nursing facilities in july  cms released its skilled nursing facility pps update for the fiscal year  which began october  the notice provides a rate update  which reflects a market basket increase that is reduced under the aca by a multifactor productivity adjustment 
cms estimates the update will increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year by million compared to fiscal year levels 
the notice also provides an update to certain fiscal year policy changes involving recalibration of the parity adjustment  reallocation of group therapy time  and changes to the mds patient assessment instrument 
the effect of the pps rate update on our revenues is dependent upon our census and the mix of our patients at the pps pay rates 
cms final rule  which began october   provided for a net reduction in pps payments to skilled nursing facilities 
the fiscal year rule also adjusted the method by which group therapy is counted for reimbursement purposes  and changes the timing in which patients who received therapy must be reassessed for purposes of determining their rug category 
we anticipated that  assuming other factors remained constant  cms reduced reimbursement rates for its fiscal year would have a significant and adverse effect on our results of operations when compared to the periods in cms fiscal year we estimated the resulting decrease in revenue would be approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
furthermore  changes in government requirements for providing therapy services were estimated to increase our operating costs by approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
our results differed from our estimates because of an improved patient mix and because of the implementation of cost saving measures 
with the passing of the american taxpayer relief act of  the scheduled spending cuts of not more than for medicare skilled nursing facility payments were delayed until march  the spending cuts will go into effect unless a new law is enacted that specifically addresses these cuts 
we are unable to predict the financial impact of sequestration  if enacted  or other spending cuts congress may implement 
for  our average medicare per diem rate for skilled nursing facilities decreased compared to the same period in no assurances can be given as to whether congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future  the timing of any action or the form of relief  if any  that may be enacted 
medicare homecare programs in january  we received a decrease in the overall hh pps base rate of 
the rate reduction impacted individual providers unevenly 
cms eliminated hypertension as a factor in the calculation  reduced the weights on therapy episodes  and increased the weights on non therapy episodes 
we estimated the effect of the revenue decrease for nhc homecare programs to be approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
in november  cms issued a final rule to update and revise reimbursement rates for the calendar year the final rule includes a market basket increase  a reduction mandated by the aca  and a negative case mix adjustment 
the net effect of these changes is a decrease in the base rate 
additionally  the wage index was updated which impacts providers differently depending on their geographic location and changes were made to outlier eligibility standards 
in total  cms estimates that the effect of these changes will result in a reduction in reimbursement to home health providers 
with the passing of the american taxpayer relief act of  the scheduled spending cuts of not more than for medicare home health payments were delayed until march  the spending cuts will go into effect unless a new law is enacted that specifically addresses these cuts 
we are unable to predict the financial impact of sequestration  if enacted  or other spending cuts congress may implement 
medicaid skilled nursing facilities beginning january   the state of tennessee implemented a rate reduction for their medicaid program 
on may  and effective retroactively to january   tennessee legislation voted to restore of the rate reduction  thus leaving a net rate reduction for the first six months of effective july  and for the fiscal year  the state of tennessee implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases 
we estimate the resulting increase in revenue beginning july  will be approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
in february and effective retroactively to october   the state of missouri s medicaid program announced a net per patient day increase in their medicaid rates 
we estimated the resulting increase in revenue of approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
there was no rate increase or decrease implemented as of october  for the medicaid program in the state of missouri 
there was no rate increase or decrease implemented for the fiscal year beginning october  for the medicaid program in the state of south carolina 
effective october  and for the fiscal year  south carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases 
we estimate the resulting increase in revenue beginning october  will be approximately  annually  or  per quarter 
overall our average medicaid per diem increased in compared to we face challenges with respect to states medicaid payments  because many currently do not cover the total costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
states will continue to control medicaid expenditures and also look for adequate funding sources  including provider assessments 
the dra includes several provisions designed to reduce medicaid spending 
these provisions include  among others  provisions strengthening the medicaid asset transfer restrictions for persons seeking to qualify for medicaid long term care coverage  which could  due to the timing of the penalty period  increase facilities exposure to uncompensated care 
other provisions could increase state funding for home and community based services  potentially having an impact on funding for nursing facilities 
there is no assurance that the funding for our services will increase or decrease in the future 
compared to results for compared to include a decrease in net operating revenues and a decrease in income before income taxes 
for comparative purposes  other operating expenses for the year included a favorable result within our accrued risk reserves of  thus lowering the expense 
excluding this adjustment  the year ended december  would have reflected an increase of in income before taxes compared to medicare and managed care per diem rates decreased and  respectively  in compared to medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased and  respectively  in compared to the medicare per diem rate decrease is due to the rate reduction in fiscal year  but is partially offset by the increased acuity levels of our patients 
net patient revenues decreased  or  compared to the same period last year 
in addition to our medicare per diem rates decreasing  the remaining decrease in net patient revenues is due from the assignment of our solaris hospice business to caris effective january  there was  of net patient revenues recorded for the solaris hospice entities for the year ended december  the increase in our earnings in equity recorded from caris is presented in non operating income in our consolidated statements of income

as discussed in note  fourteen of the skilled nursing centers we manage are under the direction of a receiver 
it is unknown at this time how long we will continue to manage the facilities or the receiver intentions 
however  if we no longer manage some or all of the fourteen facilities  such impact may be adverse and material to our future results of operations and cash flows 
non operating income in increased  or  to  the increase in is primarily due to our increased investment in caris

other operating expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as discussed above  other operating expenses for the year included a nonrecurring favorable result within our accrued risk reserves of  thus lowering the expense

working capital primarily consisted of an increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents of  an increase in accounts receivable of  a decrease in accrued payroll of  and an increase in accrued risk reserves and other current liabilities of the increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents is from nhc and other healthcare facilities paying insurance premiums into nhc insurance companies  which restrict the cash payment 
the increase in accounts receivable is due primarily from reinsurance recoveries related to us being self insured for professional liability  workers compensation and health insurance coverage 
the decrease in accrued payroll is due to the timing of payments 
a portion of the incentive bonuses were paid in  ahead of the income tax increases that were to take place in the increase in accrued risk reserves and other current liabilities is due primarily from the unfavorable results within professional liability  workers compensation  and health insurance coverage during the fiscal year

short term liquidity effective october   we extended the maturity of our  revolving credit agreement to october  at december   we do not have any funds borrowed against the credit agreement 
the entire amount of  is available to be drawn for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities 
in addition to cash flows from operations  our current cash on hand of  marketable securities of  and as needed  our borrowing capacity  are expected to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements and our growth and development plans in the next twelve months 
long term liquidity our  revolving credit agreement matures on october  we currently anticipate renewing the credit agreement at that time 
while we have had no indication from the lender there is any question about renewal  there has been no commitment at this time 
we entered into this loan originally on october   and have renewed the loan five times  with a one year maturity 
at the inception and at each renewal  the lender offered alternative notes with longer maturities  but the company chose a one year maturity because of the terms 
if we have an outstanding balance and are not able to refinance our debt as it matures  we will be required to use our cash and marketable securities to meet our debt obligations 
this will limit our ability to fund future growth opportunities 
our ability to refinance the credit agreement  to meet our long term contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements  growth and development plans will depend upon our future performance  which will be affected by business  economic  financial and other factors  including potential changes in state and federal government payment rates for health care  customer demand  success of our marketing efforts  pressures from competitors  and the state of the economy  including the state of financial and credit markets 
contingencies impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years 
however  rates paid under the medicare and medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
currently  our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our fixed income and equity portfolios 
these investment portfolios are exposed primarily to  but not limited to  interest rate risk  credit risk  equity price risk  and concentration risk 
we also have exposure to market risk that includes our cash and cash equivalents  notes receivable  revolving credit facility  and long term debt 
the company senior management has established comprehensive risk management policies and procedures to manage these market risks 
interest rate risk the fair values of our fixed income investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair values of those instruments 
additionally  the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
at december   we have available for sale debt securities in the amount of  the fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
the portfolio composition allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the fixed maturity portfolio allows our insurance company subsidiaries to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet obligations 
as of december   both our long term debt and revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates 
currently  we have long term debt outstanding of million and the revolving credit facility is zero 
however  we do intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future 
based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of million and our outstanding long term debt  a change in interest rates would change our interest cost by approximately  approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at variable rates generally at the prime rate plus 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in a related increase or decrease in interest income of approximately  our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months when purchased 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
we do not currently use any derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of such instruments in the future would be subject to approvals by the investment committee of the board 
credit risk credit risk is managed by diversifying the fixed maturity portfolio to avoid concentrations in any single industry group or issuer and by limiting investments in securities with lower credit ratings 
corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage backed securities comprise approximately of the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
at december   the credit quality ratings for our fixed maturity portfolio consisted of the following investment grades as a percent of fair value aaa rated  aa rated  a rated  and bbb rated 
equity price and concentration risk our available for sale equity securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
at december   the fair value of our equity marketable securities is approximately  of the million equity securities portfolio  our investment in national health investors  inc nhi comprises approximately  or  of the total fair value 
we manage our exposure to nhi by closely monitoring the financial condition  performance  and outlook of the company 
hypothetically  a change in quoted market prices would result in a related increase or decrease in the fair value of our equity investments of approximately  at december   our equity securities had unrealized gains of  of the  unrealized gains   is related to nhi
