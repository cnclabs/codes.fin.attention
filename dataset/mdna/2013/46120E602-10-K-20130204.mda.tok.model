item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body 
however  the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to the patient  typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times  increased hospitalization costs and additional pain and suffering relative to mis  where mis is available 
over the past two decades  mis has reduced trauma to the patient by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions 
mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures  but it has not been widely adopted for complex reconstructive surgeries 
the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients who would otherwise undergo open surgery by using computational  robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional mis 
surgeons using the da vinci system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a high resolution  d  hd image of the surgical field 
this immersive visualization connects 
table of contents surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments 
while seated at the console  the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner  similar to the way he or she has been trained to do in open surgery 
our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist  while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon s hand 
in designing our products  we focus on making our technology easy to use 
our products fall into four broad categories da vinci surgical systems  insite and firefly fluorescence imaging systems  instruments and accessories eg  endowrist  endowrist one  da vinci single site and training technologies 
we have commercialized three generations of da vinci surgical systems  the first is our da vinci standard surgical system  first commercialized in  the second is our da vinci s surgical system  commercialized in  and the third and most current is our da vinci si surgical system  commercialized in systems include a surgeon s console  imaging electronics  a patient side cart and computational hardware and software 
instruments and accessories are used with systems to allow surgeons the flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed in a particular surgery 
lastly  training technologies include our recently developed da vinci skills simulator and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery 
we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy invasiveness 
here procedure efficacy is a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself 
when the patient value of a da vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options  patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer da vinci surgery  which potentially could result a local market share shift 
adoption occurs procedure by procedure  and is driven by the relative patient value of da vinci procedures compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state 
procedures worldwide procedures the adoption of da vinci surgery has the potential to progress for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non da vinci alternatives 
we focus our organization and investments on developing  marketing and training for those products and procedures where we believe da vinci can bring significant patient value relative to competitive therapies 
in  da vinci was used primarily in gynecology  urology  general surgery  cardiothoracic surgery and head and neck surgery 
target procedures in gynecology include da vinci hysterectomy dvh  sacrocolpopexy  myomectomy  and endometriosis resection 
target procedures in urology include da vinci prostatectomy dvp  partial nephrectomy and pyeloplasty 
target procedures in general surgery include single site cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures 
in cardiothoracic surgery  they include da vinci lobectomy and da vinci mitral valve repair 
lastly  in head and neck surgery  the target procedures include da vinci trans oral robotic surgery tors for throat and base of tongue cancers 
in  approximately  surgical procedures were performed with the da vinci surgical system  compared to approximately  and  procedures performed in and respectively 
the growth in our overall procedure volume was driven by growth in us gynecologic procedures  us general surgery procedures  and international dvp procedures  partially offset by a decline of approximately in us dvp procedures compared to us procedures overall us procedure volume grew to approximately  in  compared to approximately  in and  in gynecology is our largest us surgical specialty 
overall us gynecology procedure volume grew from approximately  cases in to approximately  in and to approximately  in growth in gynecology was driven by continued adoption of dvh  our highest volume procedure  and other 
table of contents gynecologic procedures  including sacrocolpopexy  endometriosis resection  and myomectomy 
us dvh procedure volume grew from approximately  cases in to approximately  cases in  of which approximately  were for the treatment of cancer and approximately  related to benign conditions 
we estimate the total annual us addressable robotic hysterectomy market to be approximately  to  cases  of which approximately  are for cancer 
urology is our second largest surgical specialty 
us urology procedure volume was approximately  in  compared to approximately  in and  in the urology decline was driven by lower dvp procedure volume 
we consider dvp to be the standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer in the us about  dvps were performed in  compared to  in and  in the approximately reduction in dvp procedures in the us reflects pressures from reduced levels of psa testing and increased use of non surgical disease management 
other non dvp urology procedures  including partial and full nephrectomy  increased approximately in to  cases 
general surgery is our third largest and fastest growing specialty 
overall us general surgery procedure volume grew from approximately  cases in to approximately  in and to approximately  in general surgery growth was led by an increase in cholecystectomy and colorectal procedures 
da vinci single site instrumentation was fda cleared for us cholecystectomies in december since launch  over customers have purchased single site instruments 
multi port robotic cholecystectomies are also being performed 
international procedures overall international procedure volume grew to approximately  in  compared to approximately  in and  in dvp accounted for the majority of international procedures  having grown from about  in to  in and to  in the overall international procedure growth rate of approximately in was lower than the growth rate in  primarily due to lower european growth rates resulting from austerity measures  psa testing  non surgical disease management trends and other company specific matters 
business model we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  derived from sales of instruments  accessories  and service 
the da vinci surgical system generally sells for between million and million  depending upon configuration and geography  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
we generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our endowrist instruments and accessory products used in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system 
endowrist instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery  at which point they are replaced 
we also generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service 
we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold at an annual rate of approximately  to  per year  depending upon the configuration of the underlying system 
these service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods 
recurring revenue has grown at a rate equal to or faster than the rate of growth of system revenue 
recurring revenue increased from million  or of total revenue in to million  or of total revenue in to  million  or of total revenue in the increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da vinci surgical systems 
we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
the installed base of da vinci surgical systems has grown to  at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  
table of contents we provide our products through a direct sales organization in the us and in europe  excluding spain  italy  greece and eastern european countries 
in january  we acquired our korean distributor and began selling directly to korean customers 
beginning in  we also will provide our products through a direct sales organization in the czech republic  slovakia  and hungary  whereas prior to  these markets were served by a distributor 
in the remainder of our world markets  we provide our products through distributors 
regulatory activities we believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the us and most of europe 
as we make additions to target procedures and introduce new products  we will continue to seek necessary clearances 
in november  we received shonin approval from the mhlw for our da vinci s surgical system in japan 
the initial sales were primarily made to early adopters 
since receiving the approval  we have been focusing our efforts on obtaining specific reimbursement for da vinci procedures in japan and building our own organization  intuitive surgical japan 
prior to april  we had partnered with the experienced regulatory team from jjkk to assist in navigating the japanese regulatory process 
in april  the marketing authorization application for da vinci products was transferred to intuitive surgical japan from jjkk  and intuitive surgical japan now has primary responsibility for regulatory support of our products in japan 
we continue to partner with adachi co  ltd as our separate independent distribution partner for marketing  selling  and servicing our products in japan 
effective april  we obtained national reimbursement for the dvp procedures in japan  our only reimbursed procedure to date 
in october  we obtained mhlw approval for da vinci si surgical systems in japan 
if we are not successful in obtaining additional regulatory clearances  importation licenses  and adequate procedure reimbursements for future products and procedures  then the demand for our products in japan could be limited 
business events and trends economic environment 
the credit and sovereign debt issues impacting europe have slowed capital sales and curtailed procedure growth throughout most of european procedure growth was lower than we anticipated in although capital sales and procedure growth outside of europe have been strong  european uncertainties could adversely impact demand for our products globally 
demand for da vinci systems fluctuates quarter to quarter based upon changing economic and geopolitical factors 
da vinci prostatectomy 
we believe the us preventive services task force recommendation against psa screening  as well as suggested changes in treatment pattern for low risk prostate cancer away from definitive treatment have led to a decline in our dvp business 
we estimate that dvp procedures in the us declined approximately during the year ended december  compared with we are unable to predict the extent to which these recommendations and treatment pattern changes will be followed by governments or clinicians in non us jurisdictions 
new product introductions da vinci skills simulator 
in the first quarter of  we began shipping our da vinci skills simulator 
the simulator is a practice tool for the da vinci si surgical system that gives a user the opportunity to efficiently practice in his or her facility with the da vinci surgeon console controls 
the simulator incorporates three dimensional  physics based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment 
the user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console 
upon completion of a skills exercise  the simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task specific metrics 
the simulator is intended to augment  not replace  existing training programs for the da vinci si surgical system 
most da vinci skills simulators have been sold in connection with new da vinci si surgical system sales 
we sold and da vinci skills simulators during the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents da vinci single site instruments 
da vinci single site is a set of non wristed instruments and accessories that allow the da vinci si systems to work through a single incision  typically in the umbilicus  rather than multiple incisions 
single incision surgery is intended to minimize invasiveness to patients by reducing the number of ports required to enter the body and is typically utilized for less complex surgery than multi port surgery 
non robotic single incision surgery today is typically performed with modified laparoscopic instruments 
early clinical adoption of this manual technique has been mostly positive  although physicians have reported that manual single incision surgery is technically and ergonomically challenging 
da vinci single site instruments and accessories were designed to address these issues 
in february  we received the ce mark for our da vinci single site instrument kit and began selling these new products in europe 
the majority of da vinci single site procedures performed in europe to date have been cholecystectomies 
in december  we received us fda regulatory clearance to market our single site instrumentation in the us for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures  our only us clearance to date 
we are encouraged by hospital  surgeon  and patient interest in da vinci single site  with over us customers having purchased da vinci single site kits as of december  however  as we are in the early stages of introducing this instrumentation to the us market  we are not able to predict the extent to which da vinci single site may be adopted 
during the third quarter of  we submitted our k submission to the fda for single site instruments and indications for use in benign hysterectomy and salpingo oophorectomy 
da vinci firefly fluorescence imaging 
in the first quarter of  we launched our firefly fluorescence imaging product firefly for use with the da vinci si surgical system in the us and europe 
this new imaging capability combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da vinci camera head  endoscope and laser based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to visualize critical anatomy 
firefly kits configured into new da vinci system sales are included in systems revenue  while firefly kits sold separately for existing systems are included in instruments and accessories revenue 
adoption of firefly is progressing  with its primary utilization in partial nephrectomy procedures 
firefly is also being used in certain gynecology and general surgery cases 
endowrist one vessel sealer 
in december  we received fda clearance for the endowrist one vessel sealer 
the endowrist one vessel sealer is a wristed  single use instrument intended for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument 
this instrument enables da vinci si surgeons to fully control vessel sealing  while providing the benefits of da vinci surgery 
this instrument is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general surgery and gynecologic procedures 
clinical response to the endowrist one vessel sealer has been encouraging  with positive commentary on precision  articulation  vessel sealing quality and thermal spread 
we expect applications for the endowrist one vessel sealer to be centered on general surgery and gynecologic oncology procedures 
we are still in the early stages of introducing endowrist one vessel sealer and are not able to predict the extent to which the endowrist one vessel sealer may be adopted 
endowrist stapler in october  we received fda clearance for the endowrist stapler instrument with blue and green mm reloads 
the endowrist stapler is a wristed  stapling instrument intended for resection  transection and or creation of anastomoses in general  gynecologic and urologic surgery 
this instrument enables operators of the da vinci si to precisely position and fire the stapler 
we expect its initial surgical use to be directed towards colorectal procedures 
we intend to rollout the endowrist stapler to a limited number of customers in early and slowly to a broader set of customers later in as we have not begun selling endowrist stapler  we are not able to predict the extent to which the endowrist stapler may be adopted

table of contents gross profit product gross profit during the year ended december  increased to  million  or of product revenue  compared with  million  or of product revenue  during the year ended december  the higher product gross profit was driven by higher product revenue  as described above 
the lower product gross profit percentage primarily reflects the introduction of newly launched products possessing lower margins at their introduction point  particularly da vinci single site instruments and the endowrist one vessel sealer 
margins on newly launched products will typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes  temporary tooling costs and other start up costs 
as volumes increase  and as we refine the manufacturing processes and products  we would expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products

these amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers  for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property
