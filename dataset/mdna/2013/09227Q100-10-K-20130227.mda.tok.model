executive summary we provide on premise and cloud based software solutions and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations 
our products and services enable nonprofit organizations to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve communications with constituents  manage their finances and optimize internal operations 
as of december   we had more than  active customers distributed across multiple verticals within the nonprofit market including education  foundations  health and human services  religion  arts and cultural  public and societal benefits  environment and animal welfare as well as international foreign affairs 
we derive revenue from selling perpetual licenses or charging for the use of our software products in a hosted environment and providing a broad offering of services  including consulting  training  installation and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training and implementation are generally not essential to the functionality of our software products and are sold separately 
furthermore  we derive revenue from providing hosting services  performing donor prospect research engagements  selling lists of potential donors  and providing transaction processing services  benchmarking studies and data modeling services 
we completed our acquisition of convio in may for million in consideration 
we funded the acquisition through both cash on hand and borrowings under our amended credit facility 
during  we remained focused on integrating the convio operations and managing expenses to enable us to realize synergies while making investments for future growth of our combined operations  making initial post merger product roadmap decisions  which included the decision to sunset the convio common ground solution and our move to a single event fundraising module  and continuing the shift in our offerings towards subscription based pricing to meet the needs and preferences of our customers

in order to pay any cash dividends and or repurchase shares of stock no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the credit facility  and we must be in compliance with the leverage ratio set forth in the credit agreement 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our credit facility 
at december   our total cash and cash equivalents balance includes approximately million of cash that was held by operations outside the us while these funds may not be needed to fund our us operations for at least the next months  if we need these funds  we would be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate the funds 
our current plans anticipate repatriating undistributed earnings in canada 
we currently do not anticipate a need to repatriate our other cash held outside the us operating cash flow net cash provided by operating activities of million decreased by million during throughout both and  our cash flows from operations were derived principally from i our earnings from on going operations prior to non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and adjustments to our provision for sales 
table of contents blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued returns and allowances  ii the tax benefit associated with our deferred tax asset  which reduces our cash outlay for income tax expense  and iii changes in our working capital 
working capital changes as they impact the statement of cash flows are composed of changes in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue 
cash flow from operations associated with working capital decreased million in when compared to this net decrease is principally due to an increase in the amount of cash paid for income taxes  fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments  partially offset by a decrease in the amount of deferred commissions and other deferred costs 
investing cash flow net cash used in for investing activities was million compared to million in the increase is due to the acquisition of convio in may additionally  we increased the amount spent on computer equipment and software associated with the infrastructure that supports our subscription based offerings from million in to million in in financing cash flow during  we received proceeds from borrowings of million under our credit facility to fund the acquisition of convio and made debt repayments of million 
we paid dividends of million which was relatively consistent with the amount paid in commitments and contingencies as of december   we had future minimum commitments as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases debt and interest total included in the table above is million of interest 
the actual interest expense recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income will depend on the amount of debt  the length of time the debt is outstanding and the interest rate  which could be different from our assumptions used in the above table 
the term loans under our credit facility require periodic principal payments 
the balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the credit facility in february our commitments related to operating leases have not been reduced by the future minimum lease commitments under sublease agreements  incentive payments and reimbursement of leasehold improvements 
we utilize third party relationships in conjunction with our products 
the contractual arrangements vary in length from one to three years 
in certain cases  these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment 
the total remaining minimum purchase commitments under these arrangements at december   were approximately million through we incurred expense under these arrangements of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in february  our board of directors approved our annual dividend rate of per share for dividends at the annual rate would aggregate to million assuming million shares of common stock are outstanding 
our ability to continue to declare and pay dividends quarterly this year and beyond might be restricted by  among other things  the terms of our credit facility  general economic conditions and our ability to generate adequate operating cash flow 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
foreign currency exchange rates approximately of our total net revenue for the year ended december  was derived from operations outside the united states 
we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
the accumulated currency translation adjustment  recorded within other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders equity  was a loss of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our us  canadian or uk entities 
the contracts entered into by the uk entity are almost always denominated in us dollars  contracts entered into by our canadian subsidiary are generally denominated in canadian dollars  and contracts entered into by our uk  australian and the netherlands subsidiaries are generally denominated in pounds sterling  australian dollars and euros  respectively 
historically  as the us dollar weakened  foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non us currencies 
during  foreign translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non us currencies 
though we do not believe our exposure to currency exchange rates has had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position  we intend to continue to monitor such exposure and take action as appropriate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact revenue recognition  long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  stock based compensation  the provision for income taxes  capitalization of software development costs  our allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  deferred sales commissions  accounting for business combinations and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily generated from the following sources i charging for the use of our software products in a hosted environment  ii selling perpetual licenses of our software products  iii providing professional services including implementation  training  consulting  analytic  hosting and other services  and iv providing software maintenance and support services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or services has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

table of contents blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued determining whether and when these criteria have been met can require significant judgment and estimates 
we deem acceptance of an agreement to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery for our products occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted  and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers 
our typical agreements do not include customer acceptance provisions  however  if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
payment terms greater than days are considered to be beyond our customary payment terms 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer revenue recognition until collection 
revenue is recognized net of sales returns and allowances 
subscriptions we provide hosting services to customers who have purchased perpetual rights to certain of our software products hosting services 
revenue from hosting services  as well as data enrichment services  data management services and online training programs is recognized ratably beginning on the activation date over the term of the agreement  which generally ranges from one to three years 
any related set up fees are recognized ratably over the estimated period that the customer benefits from the related hosting service 
we make certain of our software products available for use in hosted application arrangements without licensing perpetual rights to the software hosted applications 
revenue from hosted applications is recognized ratably beginning on the activation date over the term of the agreement  which generally ranges from one to three years 
any revenue related to upfront activation  set up or implementation fees is recognized ratably over the estimated period that the customer benefits from the related hosted application 
direct and incremental costs relating to activation  set up and implementation for hosted applications are capitalized until the hosted application is deployed and in use  and then expensed over the estimated period that the customer benefits from the related hosted application 
for arrangements that have multiple elements and do not include software licenses  we allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to those elements that qualify as separate units of accounting 
the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  ii third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  and iii best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
in general  we use vsoe to allocate the selling price to subscription and service deliverables 
revenue from transaction processing fees is recognized when the amounts are determined  reported and billed 
credit card fees directly associated with processing donations for customers are included in subscriptions revenue  net of related transaction costs 
license fees we sell software licenses with maintenance  varying levels of professional services and  in certain instances  with hosting services 
we allocate revenue to each of the elements in these arrangements using the residual method under which we first allocate revenue to the undelivered elements  typically the non software license components  based on objective evidence of the fair value of the various elements 
we determine the fair value of the various elements using different methods 
fair value for maintenance services associated with software licenses is based upon renewal rates stated in the agreements with customers  which vary according to the level of support service provided under the maintenance program 
fair value of professional services and other products and services is based on sales of these products and services to other customers when sold on a stand alone basis 
any remaining revenue is allocated to the delivered elements which is normally the software license in the arrangement 
when a software license is sold with software customization services  generally the services are to provide customer support for assistance in creating special reports and other enhancements that will assist with efforts to improve operational efficiency and or to support business process improvements 
these services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
however  when software customization services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue for both the software license and the services using the percentage of completion method 

table of contents blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued services we generally bill consulting  installation and implementation services based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel related expenses 
revenue is recognized for these services over the period the services are performed 
we recognize analytic services revenue from donor prospect research engagements  the sale of lists of potential donors  benchmarking studies and data modeling service engagements upon delivery 
in arrangements where we provide customers the right to updates to the lists during the contract period  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class at a per attendee price or at a packaged price for several attendees  and recognize the related revenue upon the customer attending and completing training 
additionally  we sell fixed rate programs  which permit customers to attend unlimited training over a specified contract period  typically one year  subject to certain restrictions  and revenue is recognized ratably over this contract period 
maintenance we recognize revenue from maintenance services ratably over the contract term  typically one year 
maintenance contracts are at rates that vary according to the level of the maintenance program and are generally renewable annually 
maintenance contracts also include the right to unspecified product upgrades on an if and when available basis 
certain support services are sold in prepaid units of time and recognized as revenue upon their usage 
deferred revenue to the extent that our customers are billed for the above described services in advance of delivery  we record such amounts in deferred revenue 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we use the undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of our risks and required investment returns at the time the impairment assessment is made 
goodwill is assigned to our five reporting units  which are defined as our four operating segments see note to our consolidated financial statements  and blackbaud payment services 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
significant judgment is required in the assessment of qualitative factors 
to the extent the qualitative factors indicate that the fair value is likely less than the carrying amount  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
we estimate fair value for each reporting unit based on projected future cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
additionally  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
we believe the assumptions we use in estimating fair value of our reporting units are reasonable  but are also unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
if an impairment is indicated  the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value  which could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the annual impairment test of our goodwill indicated there was no impairment 

table of contents blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights using a black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to use significant judgment to make estimates regarding the life of the award  volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate and the dividend yield of our stock over the life of the award 
we determine the fair value of awards that contain market conditions using a monte carlo simulation model 
changes to these estimates would result in different fair values of awards 
we estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited and recognize expense only for those awards that ultimately vest 
significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to compensation expense for estimated forfeitures 
compensation expense in a period could be impacted  favorably or unfavorably  by differences between estimated and actual forfeitures 
income taxes we make estimates and judgments in accounting for income taxes 
the calculation of income tax provision requires estimates due to transactions  credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations  the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits 
to the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made 
we make estimates in determining tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance significant judgment is required 
we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine there is less than a likelihood that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  then an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions 
to recognize such positions we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
we must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
software development costs the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of internal use software development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
judgment is required in determining when the development stage of a product has been reached 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
capitalized costs are recorded as part of computer software costs 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
costs for the development of software to be sold are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
technological feasibility is considered to be achieved when a working model of the software product has been completed 
capitalized software development costs include direct labor costs and fringe benefit costs attributed to programmers  software engineers and quality control teams working on products after they reach technological feasibility but before they are generally available to customers for sale 
capitalized software development costs are typically amortized over the estimated product life of generally three years  on a straight line basis 

table of contents blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customers a day right of return and under certain circumstances we provide service related credits to our customers 
we maintain a reserve for returns and credits which is estimated based on several factors including historical experience  known credits yet to be issued  the aging of customer accounts and the nature of service level commitments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
provisions for sales returns are charged against the related revenue items 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
any necessary provision is reflected in general and administrative expense 
deferred sales commissions we pay sales commissions at the time contracts with customers are signed or shortly thereafter  depending on the size and duration of the sales contract 
to the extent that these commissions relate to revenue not yet recognized  the amounts are recorded as deferred sales commission costs 
subsequently  the commissions are recognized as expense as the revenue is recognized 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation and valuation require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to estimates about future expected cash flows from customer contracts  proprietary technology and non compete agreements  the acquired company brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be  as well as expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business 
we record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and  therefore  the probability of loss and the estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain 
these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by us 
although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters  we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any particular period 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which i eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income  or oci  as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and ii requires the presentation of each component of net income and each component of oci either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we have presented each component of net income and oci in a single continuous statement 
effective january   we adopted asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  which amends asc  fair value 
table of contents blackbaud  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued measurement 
asu provides common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs and improves the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
asu is effective for entities prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
asu is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not anticipate any material impact from the adoption of asu in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which simplifies how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test currently required by asc topic on general intangibles other than goodwill 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  provided that the entity has not yet issued its financial statements 
we do not anticipate any material impact from the adoption of asu item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk through a combination of short term and long term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments 
due to the nature of our debt  we have concluded that we face no material market risk exposure as of december  for a discussion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  see the foreign currency exchange rates section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report
