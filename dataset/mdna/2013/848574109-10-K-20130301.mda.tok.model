our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements 
we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
recent events on february   engineers of the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace speea union at boeing approved a new contract 
however  the technical employees represented by speea rejected boeing contract offer and authorized a strike 
while this does not mean the employees are on strike  if a strike were to occur at boeing  work slow downs could impact spirit 
we do not anticipate a significant impact to our business at this time 
on february   hawker beechcraft emerged from bankruptcy as beechcraft corporation 
as detailed in our discussions on accounts receivable  we currently have a receivable from hawker beechcraft which is fully reserved against 
following the company public announcement in october of that it recognized million of forward losses in the third quarter of  a number of law firms published advertisements seeking plaintiffs for a lawsuit related to those losses 
on february   one of those law firms filed a shareholder derivative suit on behalf of a spirit holdings investor against the directors and certain officers of spirit holdings  alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to spirit holdings in connection with the timing of the recognition of those forward losses 
although spirit holdings is named as a nominal defendant in the action  no recovery is sought from spirit holdings 
the company believes that the suit is baseless  and intends to vigorously defend against it 
in october  spirit was advised by the staff of the securities and exchange commission that they are conducting an inquiry that the company believes to be focused on the timing of forward losses recognized in the third quarter of the company is fully cooperating with the inquiry 
the company cannot predict or determine whether any proceeding may be instituted as a result of the inquiry or the outcome of any proceeding that may be instituted 
on december   spirit aerosystems celebrated the completion of the th boeing b composite forward fuselage section 
this section will be shipped to boeing final assembly facility in charleston  south carolina in early on november   spirit aerosystems announced that its president and chief executive officer  jeffrey l 
turner had advised the board of his intention to retire in early  after the board has had an opportunity to conduct a search for and hire a new ceo 
mr 
turner will continue to serve as president and ceo until his successor takes office 
the board convened a special ceo search committee comprised of spirit board members robert johnson  tawfiq popatia  francis raborn  paul fulchino and ronald kadish to begin the ceo search process  targeting qualified internal and external candidates 

table of contents overview we are one of the largest independent non oem original equipment manufacturer aircraft parts designers and manufacturers of commercial aerostructures in the world  based on annual revenues  as well as the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to boeing 
in addition  we are one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to airbus 
boeing and airbus are the two largest aircraft oems in the world 
aerostructures are structural components  such as fuselages  propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial and military aircraft 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated net revenues of  million and net income of million 
we are organized into three principal reporting segments fuselage systems  which includes forward  mid and rear fuselage sections  propulsion systems  which includes nacelles  struts pylons and engine structural components  and wing systems  which includes wings  wing components  flight control surfaces and other miscellaneous structural parts 
all other activities fall within the all other segment  principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services  tooling contracts  and sales of natural gas through a tenancy in common with other companies that have operations in wichita  kansas 
the fuselage systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in wichita  kansas and kinston  north carolina  with an assembly plant in saint nazaire  france for the a xwb program 
the propulsion systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in wichita and chanute  kansas 
the wing systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma  prestwick  scotland  subang  malaysia  and kinston  north carolina 
fuselage systems  propulsion systems  wing systems and all other represented approximately   and less than  respectively  of our net revenues for the twelve months ended december  market trends the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct and significant effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
the global industry revenue grew in and  and is forecast to continue growing in and  after significant contraction in and one key driver of the commercial aircraft market is airline passenger and cargo traffic trends 
principal factors influencing traffic are economic growth and political stability 
a significant downturn in global or regional economic stability  or exogenous shocks such as terrorism or a pandemic  could suppress traffic and negatively affect demand for our key customers products 
demand for commercial aerostructures is highly correlated to demand for new aircraft 
boeing and airbus have experienced a combined backlog growth of almost  units since december of the year end combined backlog was  aircraft 
high backlog levels are expected to continue to drive increasing production and delivery forecasts in the near to mid term from both boeing and airbus 
the following table sets forth the historical deliveries of boeing and airbus for through and delivery expectations for boeing airbus total boeing has announced that it expects its deliveries to be approximately aircraft 
airbus announced that it expects deliveries to exceed units in new program inventory inventory continues to grow in terms of absolute dollars and remains stable as a percentage of total assets 
inventory as a percentage of total assets was  and at december   and  respectively 
this overall trend in inventory is driven primarily by our contractually required 
table of contents investments in new programs  which include the boeing b  b  gulfstream g and g  airbus a xwb  sikorsky ch k and rolls royce br programs 
the contracts for these new programs accounted for a decrease in inventory from to of million  which is net of forward loss charges of million  million  million  million  million and million recorded in on our b  b  g  g  a xwb and rolls royce br contracts  respectively 
excluding the forward loss charges  these programs would have increased inventory by million from to the increases in inventory for new programs in the last few years are a result of the application of the percentage of completion method of contract accounting with regard to inventory and revenue recognition 
under this method  investments in new contracts  including contractual pre production costs and recurring production costs in excess of the projected average cost to manufacture all units in the contract block  initially accumulate in inventory for the related contract 
once production has reached a point where the cost to produce a ship set falls below such projected average cost  the inventory balance for such program will begin to decrease 
as many of our new programs are either in the pre production phase or the early stages of recurring production  we expect that inventory balances will continue to increase in deferred inventory costs are evaluated for recoverability through their inclusion in the total costs used in the calculation of each contract estimated profit margin 
when the estimated total contract costs exceed total estimated contract revenues  an inventory reserve is established 
new programs we are currently performing work on several new programs  which are in various stages of development 
several of these programs entered flight testing in  including the gulfstream g and gulfstream g  which includes the rolls royce br the g and g aircraft received faa type certification during the third quarter of  with both programs making deliveries to the final customer by the end of the boeing b and boeing b have each received faa and jaa certifications  as well as easa certification for entry into service  and each of these boeing programs has made aircraft deliveries to the final customer 
we have delivered revenue generating production units on all of these programs 
in january  the faa and other civil aviation authorities ordered the grounding of all b aircraft in the commercial airline fleet and caused a suspension of deliveries until a determination and corrective action is in place for lithium ion battery failures 
we have delivered six revenue generating test articles on the sikorsky ch k helicopter program  and we expect to deliver the final test article by the end of the first quarter of a xwb we continue to support the development of the a xwb program through a wing contract and a fuselage contract  both of which are segmented into a non recurring design engineering phase and recurring production phase 
our a xwb wing non recurring contract continued to experience increasing engineering change costs resulting in the additional forward loss recorded in the third quarter of while we have now substantially completed the engineering and design for the first model  we still have yet to design the next derivative model which is a major element of the non recurring contracts for both the fuselage and wing contracts 
unexpected delays in the completion of the design engineering  significant changes to the design as a result of test or other requirements changes  or delays in delivery schedule could result in additional forward losses on the non recurring wing and fuselage elements of the program and additional cost pressure on the recurring elements of this program 
while we are currently projecting the wing and fuselage recurring production contracts to be profitable  there is still a substantial amount of risk similar to what we have experienced on other development programs 
particularly  our ability to manage risks related to supply chain contracting  supplier performance  execution of cost reduction strategies  hiring and retaining skilled production and management personnel  quality and manufacturing execution and program schedule delays among other risks  will determine the ultimate performance of these programs 

table of contents our a xwb section assembly has experienced various production delays and performance related issues mostly driven by engineering change to the aircraft design 
recently our government production approval at our st 
nazaire facility was suspended and we are working to have it restored 
the suspension has not impacted our ability to perform under our a xwb contract 
airbus is assisting us to work through these issues and has provided additional resources to work alongside our personnel 
while we have not incurred any specific charges for this assistance to date  there could be additional cost associated with this at some point in the future and those amounts could be significant depending on the work scope  duration of the assistance  and the allocation of responsibility 
b program as we move into higher production  our performance at the current contracted price depends on our being able to achieve production cost reductions as we gain production experience 
failure to reduce production costs as we have anticipated could result in the need to record additional forward losses on this program 
we do not yet have established pricing for the b or any future derivatives  though the b supply agreement provides for methodologies to negotiate pricing 
our ability to successfully negotiate fair and equitable prices for these models is a key factor in achieving the projected financial performance for this program 
on january   following two recent incidents with the b involving lithium ion battery failures  the faa issued an emergency airworthiness directive to address a potential battery fire risk and to require airlines to temporarily cease operations  and caused boeing to suspend deliveries  of the b aircraft 
following the faa directive  civil aviation authorities in several other jurisdictions took similar action to cover the fleets operating in their jurisdictions 
as a result  all b aircraft are currently grounded while boeing works to develop a corrective action plan 
these events have not yet resulted in any production delays  but could lead to delivery delays in the future  or otherwise impact the future of the program 
in addition  any corrective action which boeing is required to take could lead to increased production costs  reduced efficiency of the aircraft and lower demand  which could lead to additional cost pressure 
change in estimates during  several key events occurred within some of our new programs which necessitated revisions to our contract estimates due to performance issues  cost overruns and cost reduction activities that have not materialized as quickly as we had expected 
the company has failed to achieve forecasted cost reductions on many of these programs and overran engineering design cost forecasts due to excessive re design efforts 
as a result of these and other events  for the twelve months ended december   we have recorded aggregate forward loss charges of million on the boeing b  million on the gulfstream g  million on the rolls royce br  million on the gulfstream g  million on the airbus a xwb non recurring wing and million on the boeing b program 
performance issues tulsa facility the company tulsa facility has significant work content on three of the development programs b  g  and g 
the multiple complex development programs at this facility have created various performance issues that have resulted in previous changes to our contract estimates on these development programs 
the performance issues at the tulsa facility were magnified in the third quarter of when the company implemented a recovery plan which would bring the company current on the delivery schedule for its b wing components 
the company began implementing the recovery plan during late july which resulted in the addition of significant additional resources to meet delivery schedules 
as the 
table of contents company was implementing the recovery plan  it became clear during the third quarter estimation process that the remediation would have a significant impact on the future cost curves due to significant amounts of additional headcount and disruption 
type certification on september and   gulfstream received type certification on the g and g aircraft  respectively 
these type certifications impact three of the company development programs  the g  g and br the engine nacelle on the g 
type certification is a significant program milestone for commercial aerospace products as it represents the airworthiness authority approval of the completion and functionality of engineering design and the ability of the aircraft to enter into service  and leads directly to the commencement of full rate production 
however  following type certification the ability to redesign for cost is significantly less if no derivative aircraft design is planned 
we currently have no plans for derivative models  making redesign for cost improvements difficult after type certification 
the pace of cost improvements was not keeping up with projected learning curves  particularly related to redesign opportunities and as all three programs are preparing to enter full rate production  we revised our estimates to reflect higher costs 
decision on work package transfers given certain challenges of new programs at the company kinston  north carolina site and the fact that our newest facility in chanute  kansas was in the process of multiple work package transfers during the third quarter  the company decided to delay the transfer of any additional work packages into these facilities 
overall  this had a significant impact on the br program and the timing of anticipated cost reduction from the planned transfer of work content to lower cost facilities 
finalization of supplier contracts during the early phases of our development programs  the company will frequently procure small quantities of required sub assemblies and parts from our suppliers 
this practice generally forces us to pay higher unit prices for these sub assemblies and parts  but allows us flexibility in evaluating supplier performance and quality as well as addressing design changes that frequently occur during the early phases of these development programs 
once design changes subside  we generally contract on a longer term basis with our suppliers which allow us to experience more favorable supply chain pricing 
the company has been successful in negotiating lower costs with suppliers on most of these development programs  particularly during the third quarter of  however  these costs are not as low as original estimates 
this pressure on supply chain cost runs across all of our development programs 
as boeing and airbus have increased production rates on existing commercial programs  our suppliers have limited capacity to support even modest rate increases on our business jet programs 
in addition  the capacity constraint in our supply base has prevented us from moving to the supply chain certain work we currently perform in house 
as a result of higher current costs which have exceeded estimates and recent negotiations with suppliers  the company has revised supplier costs across several of the development programs 
general statement regarding new programs the next twelve months will be a critical time for all of these new programs including the gulfstream g  gulfstream g and rolls royce br programs as we either manufacture the initial units or progress through low rate production  which will establish baseline performance for the recurring cost structure 
recognition of forward losses in future periods continues to be a significant risk and will depend upon several factors including our market forecast  possible airplane program delays  our ability to successfully perform under revised design and manufacturing plans  achievement of forecasted cost 
table of contents reductions as we enter into production and our ability to successfully resolve claims and assertions with our customers and suppliers 
basis of presentation the financial statements include spirit financial statements and the financial statements of its majority owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
investments in business entities in which we do not have control  but have the ability to exercise influence over operating and financial policies  are accounted for by the equity method 
kansas industrial energy supply company kiesc  a tenancy in common with other wichita companies established to purchase natural gas  is fully consolidated as spirit owns of the entity equity 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company uk subsidiary uses local currency  the british pound  as its functional currency  the malaysian subsidiary uses the british pound and our singapore subsidiary uses the singapore dollar 
all other foreign subsidiaries and branches use the us dollar as their functional currency 
as part of the monthly consolidation process  the functional currency is translated to us dollars using the end of month currency translation rate for balance sheet accounts and average period currency translation rates for revenue and income accounts as defined by fasb authoritative guidance on foreign currency translation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory  income taxes  financing obligations  warranties  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management most subjective and complex judgments  requiring the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenues and profit recognition a significant portion of the company revenues are recognized under long term  volume based pricing contracts  requiring delivery of products over several years 
the company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
the units of delivery method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period and as the cost of earned revenue the costs allocable to the delivered units  costs allocable to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventory 
the method is used in circumstances in which an entity produces units of a basic product under production type contracts in a continuous or sequential production process to buyers specifications 
recurring long term production contracts are usually divided into contract blocks for this purpose  with each block treated as a separate contract for units of delivery production type contract accounting purposes 

table of contents the total quantity of production units to be delivered under a contract may be set as a single contract accounting block  or it can be split into multiple blocks 
unless the life of the contract is so long that it prevents reliable estimates  the entire contract quantity will typically be set as the contract accounting block quantity 
life of program or requirements based contracts often lead to continuing sales of more than twenty years 
since this is much longer than can be reliably estimated  we use parameters based on the contract facts and circumstances to determine the length of the contract block 
this analysis includes considering the customer firm orders  internal assessment of the market  reliabilities of cost estimates  potential segmentation of non recurring elements of the contract  and other factors 
contract block sizes may also be determined based on certain contractual terms such as pricing renegotiation dates such that certain contract blocks may use an approximate date instead of a defined unit quantity in order to increase the ability to estimate accurately given that the renegotiated pricing is unknown for the planning block 
shorter contract blocks for mature  ongoing programs are common due to the presence of recent cost history and probable forecast accuracy 
mature program contract blocks tend to be approximately two years in length 
initial contract blocks often require a longer time period and greater number of units in order to take into account the higher cost of early units due to a steeper experience curve and pre production design costs 
initial contract blocks on new programs can extend up to ten years 
as these programs mature and efficiencies are realized  subsequent contract block length shortens to take into account the steady state of the continuing production 
revenues from non recurring design work are recognized based on substantive milestones or use of the cost to cost method  that are indicative of our progress toward completion depending on facts and circumstances 
we follow the requirements of fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impacts of revisions in estimates are recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability become known 
a profit rate is estimated based on the difference between total revenues and total costs over a contract block 
total revenues at any given time include actual historical revenues up to that time plus future estimated revenues 
total costs at any given time include actual historical costs up to that time plus future estimated costs 
estimated revenues include negotiated or expected values for units delivered  estimates of probable recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications  price adjustments for contract and volume changes  and escalation 
costs include the estimated cost of certain pre production effort including non recurring engineering and planning subsequent to completion of final design plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
estimates take into account assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs including expected learning curve cost reductions over the term of the contract 
estimated revenues and costs also take into account the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
estimates of revenues and costs for our contract blocks span a period of multiple years and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying assumptions are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the assumptions change 
estimates of profit margins for contract accounting blocks are typically reviewed on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under the contract block are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract block 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract block as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised  which we refer to as cumulative catch up adjustments 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and total contract cost indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on 
table of contents the contract  known as a forward loss charge  is recorded to cost of sales in the period in which it becomes evident 
for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
revenues earned from providing maintenance services including any contracted research and development are recognized when the service is complete or other contractual milestones are attained 
under an agreement with airbus  beginning in certain payments that are also accounted for as consideration given by a vendor to a customer are being amortized as a reduction to net revenues 
a significant portion of the company future revenues is expected to be derived from new programs  on which we may be contracted to provide design and engineering services  recurring production  or both 
there are several risks inherent to such new programs 
in the design and engineering phase  we may incur costs in excess of our forecasts due to several factors  including cost overruns  customer directed change orders and delays in the overall program 
we may also incur higher than expected recurring production costs  which may be caused by a variety of factors  including the future impact of engineering changes or other change orders or our inability to secure contracts with our suppliers at projected cost levels 
our ability to recover these excess costs from the customer will depend on several factors  including our rights under our contracts for the new programs 
in determining our profits and losses in accordance with the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  we are required to make significant assumptions regarding our future costs  as well as the estimated number of units to be manufactured under the contract and other variables 
we continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience 
if we make material changes to our assumptions  such as a reduction in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract which could be caused by emerging market trends or other factors  an increase in future production costs or a change in the recoverability of increased design or production costs  we may experience negative cumulative catch up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized 
in some cases  we may recognize forward loss amounts 
for a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new programs  see risk factors risk factors related to our business and industry 
inventory raw materials are stated at lower of cost principally on an actual or average cost basis or market 
inventoried costs attributed to units delivered under long term contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average or deferred production costs during the early years of a contract 
these costs are deferred only to the extent the amount of actual or expected excess over average is reasonably expected to be fully offset by lower than average costs in future periods of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the actual plus anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period the loss becomes known  thus reducing total inventory to estimated realizable value 
costs in inventory include amounts relating to contracts with long production cycles  some of which are not expected to be realized within one year 
the company reviews its general stock materials and spare parts inventory each quarter to identify impaired inventory  including excess or obsolete inventory  based on historical sales trends and expected production usage 
impaired inventories are written off to work in process in the period identified 
work in process inventory includes deferred production costs for the excess of production costs over the estimated average cost per ship set  and credit balances for favorable variances on contracts between actual costs incurred and the estimated average cost per ship set for units delivered under the current production blocks 
recovery of excess over average deferred production costs is dependent on the number of ship sets ultimately sold and the ultimate selling prices and lower production costs associated with future production under these contract blocks 
work in process inventory also includes non recurring production costs 
non recurring production costs include design and engineering costs and test articles 

table of contents finished goods inventory is stated at its estimated average per unit cost based on all units expected to be produced 
capitalized pre production costs include certain contract costs  including applicable overhead  incurred before a product is manufactured on a recurring basis 
significant customer directed work changes can also cause pre production costs to be incurred 
these costs are typically recovered over a certain number of ship set deliveries 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management opinion will ultimately be realized 
tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs 
we record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
these uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes 
the final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management original estimates made in determining the income tax provision 
a change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods 
we use the flow through accounting method for tax credits 
under this method  tax credits reduce income tax expense 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we account for pensions and other post retirement benefits in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on employers accounting for pensions  post retirement benefits other than pensions  defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans see note  pension and other post retirement benefits  for additional detail on these plans 
assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and post retirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated and established in conjunction with an independent actuary 
we set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans as of the measurement date  based on a review of projected cash flows and long term high quality corporate bond yield curves 
the discount rate determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date  and is also used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
we derive assumed expected rate of return on pension assets from the long term expected returns based on the investment allocation by class specified in our investment policy 
the expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post retirement health care plans 
to determine the health care cost trend rates  we consider national health trends and adjust for our specific plan designs and locations 
stock compensation plans at inception  we adopted fasb authoritative guidance which generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for an award of equity 
table of contents instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period or immediately if there is no service period or other performance requirements 
stock based compensation represents a significant accounting policy of ours  which is further described in note within the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have established various stock compensation plans that include restricted share grants and restricted stock units

liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity include cash on hand  cash flow from operations  which includes receivables from customers and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  we may receive advance payments from customers and  during we received payments from insurers as part of the severe weather event insurance proceeds 
our liquidity requirements are driven by our long cycle business model 
our business model is comprised of four to six year non recurring investment periods  which include design and development efforts  followed by ten to twenty years of recurring production 
the non recurring investment periods require significant outflows of cash as we design the product  build tooling  purchase equipment and build initial production inventories 
these activities are typically funded partially through customer advances and milestone payments  which are offset against revenue as production units are delivered in the case of customer advances  or recognized as revenue as milestones are achieved in the case of milestone payments 
the remaining funds needed to support non recurring programs come from predictable cash inflows from our mature programs that are in the recurring phase of the production cycle 
occasionally  we have utilized borrowings and other sources of cash to fund non recurring investments during periods where cash received from our customers is not adequate to fund our purchase commitments 
the non recurring investment period typically ends concurrently with initial deliveries of completed aircraft by our customers  which indicates that a program has entered into the recurring production phase 
when a program reaches steady recurring production  it typically results in long term generation of cash from operations 
as part of our business model  we have continuously added new non recurring programs  which are supported by mature programs that are in the steady recurring phase of the production cycle to promote growth 
in december   our b  b  g and g programs completed their non recurring phase and entered into the recurring production phase

as of december   the company has received the entire settlement the insurers agreed to pay 
under the settlement agreement  the company assumes all future risk involving the severe weather event 
since the settlement resolves all contingences surrounding the storm damage proceeds  it was appropriate to recognize the entire 
table of contents settlement amount as a gain in the third quarter of in accordance with the credit agreement  the company provided a certificate to its lenders indicating that all net proceeds received in connection with destruction caused by the severe weather event would be used for repair  replacement or restoration at the wichita facility

credit ratings in  our credit rating was affirmed at bb and placed on stable outlook by standard and poor  and was affirmed at ba and placed on negative outlook by moody investor services 
our credit ratings are reviewed periodically by the rating agencies listed above 

table of contents the credit rating agencies consider many factors when assigning their ratings  such as the global economic environment and its possible impact on our financial performance  including certain financial metrics used by the rating agencies in determining our credit ratings 
accordingly  it is possible the rating agencies could downgrade our credit ratings from their current levels 
this could significantly influence the interest rate of any future debt financings 
a debt security credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold a security 
each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings 
accordingly  each rating should be considered independent of other ratings

we recognize 
table of contents the financial statement impact for tax positions only after determining that based on its technical merits the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position on audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the reserves are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in facts and circumstances  such as the tax audit progress  case law developments  and new or emerging legislation 
we believe that with an million long term payable  the tax reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome for all tax contingencies known at december  accordingly  the tax contingency liability is included as a non current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
expected backlog as of december   our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft  regional jet  business jet  and military equipment deliveries through  calculated based on contractual product prices and expected delivery volumes  was approximately billion 
this is an increase of billion from our corresponding estimate as of the end of reflecting the fact that airbus and boeing new orders exceeded deliveries in backlog is calculated based on the number of units spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts  and boeing and airbus announced backlog on our supply agreements 
the number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment  depending on contract terms 
the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders  and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  our expected backlog as of december  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period 
foreign operations we engage in business in various non us markets 
as of december   we have a foreign subsidiary with one facility in the united kingdom  which serves as a production facility  a production facility in malaysia  a worldwide supplier base  and a repair center for the european and middle eastern regions 
we purchase certain components and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers  including airbus  or resold to foreign end users ie  foreign airlines and militaries 
in addition  we operate an assembly facility in saint nazaire  france to receive and assemble center fuselage frame sections for the airbus a xwb commercial aircraft from the facility in kinston  north carolina before they are shipped to airbus 
this facility began operations in spirit is party to a joint venture operation with russian based progresstech ltd 
the company  known as spirit progresstech llc  which operates primarily from a branch office located in moscow  russia  provides aerospace engineering support services 
spirit is also party to a joint venture with hong kong aircraft engineering company limited haeco  and its subsidiary  taikoo aircraft engineering company limited taeco  cathay pacific airways limited  and cal asia to develop and implement a state of the art composite and metal bond component repair station in the asia pacific region 
the service center is called taikoo spirit aerosystems composite co

currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 

table of contents sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments countries 
furthermore  the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
inflation a majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long term contracts that set fixed unit prices  some of which provide for price adjustment for inflation 
in addition  we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed pricing when we bid on new work 
although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections  sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
spirit contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in us dollars 
spirit europe supply contracts are denominated in us dollars  british pounds sterling or euros 
in some cases  our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices  and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs 
although the raw material industry is experiencing a softening in demand  some specific materials have yet to reflect a corresponding reduction in price 
we expect that raw material market pricing volatility will remain a factor that may impact our costs  despite protections in our existing supplier arrangements 
we will continue to focus our strategic cost reduction plans on mitigating the effects of this potential cost increase on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities  we are exposed to various market risks that may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
these market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  which impact the amount of interest we must pay on our variable rate debt 
other than the interest rate swaps described below  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  the funds in which our pension assets are invested  and trade accounts receivable 
accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers  amounts earned but unbilled  particular estimated contract changes  claims in negotiation that are probable of recovery  and amounts retained by the customer pending contract negotiation 
the amounts retained by the customer include million still in negotiation at december  for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our net revenues were from sales to boeing 
additionally  at december  approximately of our outstanding accounts receivable were due from gulfstream 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses as deemed appropriate based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been material  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions and from time to time we invest excess cash in liquid short term money market funds 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts 
table of contents and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we monitor our defined benefit pension plan asset investments on a quarterly basis and we believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in these investments 
commodity price risks some raw materials and operating supplies are subject to price and supply fluctuations caused by market dynamics 
our strategic sourcing initiatives are focused on mitigating the impact of commodity price risk 
we are party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through boeing and airbus 
these collective sourcing contracts allow us to obtain raw materials at pre negotiated rates and help insulate us from market volatility across the industry for certain specialized metallic and composite raw materials used in the aerospace industry 
although our supply agreements with boeing and airbus allow us to pass on certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs to boeing and airbus in limited situations  we may not be fully compensated for such increased costs 
we also have long term supply agreements with a number of our major parts suppliers 
we  as well as our supply base  are experiencing pricing increases for metallic raw materials primarily aluminum and titanium despite softening market demand across the industry 
although the demand pressure has been somewhat eased for certain metallic and composite raw materials  the specialized nature of the materials used in the aerospace industry has prevented a corresponding decrease in prices 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we continue to review a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all raw material commodities 
any failure by our suppliers to provide acceptable raw materials  components  kits or subassemblies could adversely affect our production schedules and contract profitability 
we assess qualification of suppliers and continually monitor them to control risk associated with such supply base reliance 
to a lesser extent  we also are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain utilities and services  such as electricity  natural gas  chemicals and freight 
we utilize a range of long term agreements to minimize procurement expense and supply risk in these areas 
interest rate risks after the effect of interest rate swaps  as of december   we had million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as compared to million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest that varies with libor 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of such debt  but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next twelve months of approximately million 

table of contents we enter into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements periodically 
as of december   the interest swap agreements had notional amounts totaling million 
notional amount expires variable rate fixed rate effective fixed rate fair value  december  march month libor n a june month libor n a july month libor n a total the fixed rate represents the rate at which interest is paid by the company pursuant to the terms of its interest rate swap agreements 
as of december  the interest rate swaps are no longer effective and therefore the effective fixed rate is not applicable 
the purpose of entering into these swaps was to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fair value of the swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet as an asset  if positive  or a liability  if negative 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability of approximately million at december  the company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its determination of all estimated fair values 
the company has applied these valuation techniques at year end and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
the company attempts to manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with major financial institutions which are expected to be able to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign exchange risks as a result of the bae acquisition  we have sales  expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in british pounds sterling 
spirit europe functional currency is the british pound sterling 
however  sales of spirit europe products to boeing and some procurement costs are denominated in us dollars and euros 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause net sales and our expenses to fluctuate  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
in addition  even when revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate british pound sterling denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  the intercompany revolving credit facility with spirit europe is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the fluctuation in rates for resulted in a gain of million reflected in other income expense 
other than the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts  we have no other derivative financial instruments
