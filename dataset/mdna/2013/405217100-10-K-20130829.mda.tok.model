our cash balance increased million during the year ended june  to million 
our working capital was million at june   an increase of million from million at the end of fiscal the increase was due principally to a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories  offset partially by a million increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the company s business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
the company s cash balances are held in the united states  the united kingdom  canada and europe 
with the current exception of canada  it is the company s current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside the united states  and although a significant portion of the consolidated cash balances are maintained outside of the united states  its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its united states operations 
if these funds were to be needed for the company s operations in the united states  it may be required to record and pay significant united states income taxes to repatriate these funds 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent 
as of june   all of our investments mature in less than three months

cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities is summarized below

these items were partially offset by million of cash used to settle the first payment of contingent consideration due in connection with the greek gods acquisition 
in our internal evaluations  we also use the non gaap financial measure operating free cash flow 
the difference between operating free cash flow and net cash provided by operating activities  which is the most comparable us gaap financial measure  is that operating free cash flow reflects the impact of capital expenditures 
since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash 
as such  we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities 
we view operating free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments 
fiscal year ended june  amounts in thousands cash flow provided by operating activities purchase of property  plant and equipment operating free cash flow our operating free cash flow was million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million from the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in our operating free cash flow resulted from our current year capital expenditures  which increased million from the prior year

the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually on november and may as of june  and  million of the senior notes was outstanding

the credit agreement and the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our current and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
we are required by the terms of the credit agreement and the senior notes to comply with financial and other customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities and notes of this nature

as of june   we had non current unrecognized tax benefits of million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows 
as a result  this amount has not been included in the table above 
on october   we filed a well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement with the sec which registers an indeterminate amount of securities for future sale 
the shelf registration statement expires on october  we believe that our cash on hand of million at june   as well as projected cash flows from operations and availability under our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business  anticipated fiscal capital expenditures of approximately million  and the million of debt and lease obligations described in the table above  during the fiscal year 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting estimates  however  materially different amounts might be reported under different conditions or using assumptions  estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied 
our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used revenue recognition sales are recognized when the earnings process is complete  which occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements  title and risk of loss transfer to customers  collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable 
sales are reported net of sales and promotion incentives  which include trade discounts and promotions and certain coupon costs 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in reported sales 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
sales and promotion incentives sales incentives and promotions include price discounts  slotting fees and coupons and are used to support sales of the company s products 
these incentives are deducted from our gross sales to determine reported net sales 
the recognition of expense for these programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in estimate in the period such change occurs 
trade promotions 
accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time a product is sold to the customer based on expected levels of performance 
settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorization process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the company 
coupon redemption 
coupon redemption costs are accrued in the period in which the coupons are offered  based on estimates of redemption rates that are developed by management 
management estimates are based on recommendations 
table of contents from independent coupon redemption clearing houses as well as on historical information 
should actual redemption rates vary from amounts estimated  adjustments to accruals may be required 
valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years 
while united natural foods  inc represented approximately and a second customer represented approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no significant or unusual credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken that we expect will be collectible and repaid in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and made different judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred during the most recent three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change in the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and provide for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within the ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are reviewed to determine if any impairment exists whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment testing requires estimates and judgments to be made by management with respect to items such as underlying cash flow projections  future sales volumes and growth rates 
at this time  we believe there are no impairments of the carrying values of such assets 
accounting for acquisitions our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous brands and businesses 
the purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business  market research  strategic planning  and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies 
estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to judgment as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources 
the accounting for the acquisitions we have made requires that the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as any contingent consideration that may be part of the agreement  be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
this requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values  especially with respect to intangible assets  including estimates of expected cash flows  expected cost savings and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of these significant judgments to be made we often obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms 
we complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with some of our acquisitions  we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings 
our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities  reductions in staffing levels  and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire 
it is typical for us to rationalize the product lines of businesses acquired within the first year or two after an acquisition 
these rationalizations often include elimination of portions of the product lines acquired  the reformulation of recipes and formulas used to produce the products  and the elimination of customers that do not meet our credit standards 
in certain instances  it is necessary to change co packers used to produce the products 
each of these activities soon after an acquisition may have the effect of reducing sales to a level lower than that of the business acquired and operated prior to our acquisition 
as a result  pro forma information regarding sales cannot and should not be construed as representative of our growth rates 
stock based compensation we provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options and restricted stock to employees and non employee directors 
the cost of stock based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in the consolidated statement of 
table of contents income over the requisite service period 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight line method 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the option  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant and is recognized in expense over the vesting period using the straight line method 
we recognize compensation expense for only that portion of stock based awards that are expected to vest 
we utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates 
if the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management  adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods 
goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill  which is allocated to the company s reporting units  and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and on an interim basis if events or circumstances warrant it 
events or circumstances that might indicate an interim valuation is warranted include unexpected changes in business conditions  economic factors or a sustained decline in the company s market capitalization below the company s carrying value 
during the annual impairment test  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test included in us gaap 
for our fiscal goodwill impairment test  we determined that it was not necessary for four of our reporting units to apply the traditional two step quantitative impairment test in asc based on qualitative information that it is more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
the traditional two step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair values of our reporting units 
the estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment 
we generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating our future cash flows 
the assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability  our estimated working capital needs  as well as our weighted average cost of capital 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar businesses 
estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired 
at this point we proceed to the second step of the analysis  wherein we measure the excess  if any  of the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value  and record the impairment loss indicated 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
we measure the fair value of these assets using the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that the trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved from paying royalties for the benefits received 
we estimate the future revenues for the associated brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and our trade names as of april  the analysis and assessment of these assets indicated that no impairment was required as either the fair values equaled or exceeded the recorded carrying values for our indefinite lived intangible assets and certain reporting units  or as described above  the qualitative assessment resulted in a determination that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount for certain of our reporting units 
although we believe our assumptions are reasonable  different assumptions or changes in the future may result in different conclusions and expose us to impairment charges in the future 
the fair value of our europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
this reporting unit represented approximately of our goodwill balance as of april  holding all other assumptions constant at the testing date  a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used in the testing of this unit would reduce the estimated fair value to approximately its carrying value 
while we believe this operation can support the value of goodwill reported  this reporting unit is the most sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets deferred tax assets arise when we recognize expenses in our financial statements that will be allowed as income tax deductions in future periods 
deferred tax assets also include unused tax net operating losses and tax credits that we are allowed to carry forward to future years 
accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is more likely than not the deductions  losses  or credits will be used in the future 
a valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met 
our determination of our valuation allowances are based upon a number of assumptions  
table of contents judgments  and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
we have deferred tax benefits related to carryforward losses in the united kingdom against which full valuation allowances have been recorded 
prior to the acquisition of daniels  the company s united kingdom subsidiaries had recorded historical losses and had been affected by restructuring and other charges 
these losses represented sufficient evidence for management to determine that a full valuation allowance for these carryforward losses was appropriate 
under current uk tax law  our carryforward losses have no expiration 
if the company is able to realize any of these carryforward losses in the future  the provision for income taxes will be reduced by a release of the corresponding valuation allowance 
we also have deferred tax assets in the united kingdom related to fixed assets  for which full valuation allowances had been recorded 
during fiscal  we released these valuation allowances as we began to realize the benefits of such amounts

table of contents seasonality we manufacture and market hot tea  soups  hot eating desserts  and baking and cereal products  which show stronger sales in the cooler months  while our snack food and certain of our prepared food products lines are stronger in the warmer months 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends 
in years where there are warm winter seasons  our sales of cooler weather products  which typically increase in our second and third fiscal quarters  may be negatively impacted 
quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  inclement weather and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business 
for these reasons  you should not rely on our sales or operating results in any quarter in a fiscal year as indicators for other quarters in that fiscal year 
off balance sheet arrangements at june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k that have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation has caused increased ingredient  fuel  labor and benefits costs and in some cases has materially increased our operating expenses 
for more information regarding ingredient costs  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ingredient inputs price risk 
to the extent competitive and other conditions permit  we seek to recover increased costs through a combination of price increases  new product innovation and by implementing process efficiencies and cost reductions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on debt and cash equivalents  foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses  and ingredient inputs 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and cash equivalents  considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and obligations of us government agencies 
as of june   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
assuming current cash equivalents and variable rate borrowings  a hypothetical change in average interest rates of one percentage point would impact net interest expense by approximately million over the next fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange rates operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times  and the impact of such movements  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our consolidated net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and of net sales in these revenues  along with related expenses and capital purchases are conducted in british pounds sterling  euros and canadian dollars 
sales and operating income would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively  if average foreign exchange rates had been lower by against the us dollar in fiscal these amounts were determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical foreign exchange rate on the sales and operating income of the company s international operations 
we enter into forward contracts for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate changes  primarily on forecasted intercompany purchases by our canadian subsidiary  which we have designated as cash flow hedges 
we had approximately million in notional amounts of forward contracts at june  see note  financial instruments measured at fair value 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the stockholders equity of the company 
amounts invested in our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates of the last day of our fiscal year 
any resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cumulative translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income decreased million  net of tax  during the fiscal year ended june  ingredient inputs price risk the company purchases ingredient inputs such as wheat  corn  soybeans  almonds  canola oil and fruit and vegetables as well as packaging materials  to be used in its operations 
these inputs are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk 
we do not attempt to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the ingredients by using future  forward  option or other derivative instruments 
as a result  the majority of our future purchases of these items are subject to changes in price 
we may enter into fixed purchase commitments in an attempt to secure an adequate supply of specific ingredients 
these agreements are tied to specific market prices 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of our primary inputs as of june  based on our cost of goods sold during the twelve months ended june   such a change would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales of approximately million 
we attempt to offset the impact of input cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers
