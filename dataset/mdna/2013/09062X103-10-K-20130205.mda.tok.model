certain totals may not sum due to rounding 
executive summary introduction biogen idec is a global biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  manufacturing and marketing therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders  neurodegenerative diseases and hemophilia 
we also collaborate on the development and commercialization of rituxan and anti cd product candidates for the treatment of non hodgkin lymphoma and other conditions 
in the near term  our current and future revenues are dependent upon continued sales of our three principal products  avonex  tysabri  and rituxan as well as the potential approval of tecfidera  factor viii and factor ix 
in the longer term  our revenue growth will be dependent upon the successful clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products  our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other rights related to our marketed products and assets originating from our research and development efforts  and successful execution of external business development opportunities 
as part of our on going research and development efforts  we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels 
financial highlights the following table is a summary of financial results achieved for the years ended december  change compared to in millions  except per share amounts and percentages total revenues income from operations net income attributable to biogen idec inc diluted earnings per share attributable to biogen idec inc income from operations  as well as net income attributable to biogen idec inc for  was reduced by a charge of million to research and development expense incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with portola pharmaceuticals  inc in october in the second quarter of our share of rituxan revenues from unconsolidated joint business was reduced by approximately million to reflect our share of the approximately million compensatory damages and interest that genentech estimated might be awarded to hoechst gmbh hoechst  in relation to genentech s ongoing arbitration with hoechst 
income from operations  as well as net income attributable to biogen idec inc  for was reduced by million resulting from charges associated with our restructuring initiative announced in november income from operations  as well as net income attributable to biogen idec inc for  was reduced by charges totaling million to research and development expense incurred in connection with our collaboration agreements entered into with isis pharmaceuticals  inc in january  june and december income from operations  as well as net income attributable to biogen idec inc for  includes million from the sale of all of our rights  including rights to royalties  related to benlysta 
as described below under results of operations  our operating results for the year ended december   reflect the following worldwide avonex revenues totaled  million for  representing an increase of over our share of tysabri revenues totaled  million for  representing an increase of over 
table of contents our share of rituxan revenues totaled  million for  representing an increase of from total cost and expenses increased for compared to this increase was primarily the result of a increase in cost of sales  a increase in research and development expense  and a increase in selling  general and administrative costs over the same period in these increases reflect an increase in manufacturing costs driven by higher sales  spending associated with licensing and development of our early stage product candidates and preparing for the potential launches of tecfidera  factor viii and factor ix 
we generated  million of net cash flows from operations for  which were primarily driven by earnings 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately  million as of december  business environment we conduct our business within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  which are highly competitive 
many of our competitors are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to those we market or are developing  including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with avonex  tysabri or other products we are developing 
in addition  the commercialization of certain of our own pipeline product candidates  such as tecfidera  may negatively impact future sales of avonex  tysabri or both 
we may also face increased competitive pressures from the emergence of biosimilars 
in the us  avonex  tysabri  and rituxan are licensed under the public health service act phsa as biological products 
in march  us healthcare reform legislation amended the phsa to authorize the us food and drug administration fda to approve biological products  known as biosimilars  that are similar to or interchangeable with previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages 
global economic conditions continue to present challenges for our industry 
governments in many international markets where we operate have announced or implemented austerity measures to constrain the overall level of government expenditures 
these measures  which include efforts aimed at reforming health care coverage and reducing health care costs  particularly in certain countries in europe  continue to exert pressure on product pricing  have delayed reimbursement for our products  and have negatively impacted our revenues and results of operations 
for additional information about certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations  please read the risk factors section of this report 
the affordable care act on june   the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the patient protection and affordable care act s mandate to purchase health insurance but rejected specific funding provisions that incentivized states to expand their current medicaid programs 
as a result of this ruling  we currently expect implementation of most of the major provisions of the act to continue 
changes to the affordable care act  or other federal legislation regarding health care access  financing  or delivery and other actions taken by individual states concerning the possible expansion of medicaid could impact our financial position or results of operations 
the american taxpayer relief act of the american taxpayer relief act of the tra was passed by the house of representatives and the senate on january   and was signed into law by the president on january  the tra  among other things  extends through an array of temporary business and individual tax provisions and temporarily delayed the implementation of certain spending reductions known as sequestration 
we do not expect that the tra will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
during we expect congress to again consider sequestration and other means of reducing government expenditures  as well as an increase to the government borrowing authority 
proposals that have been raised to address government finances include changes to the medicare program  including increases to part d rebates or co payments or reductions in premium subsidies  increases to the pharmaceutical fee  changes to the coverage gap and reductions in physician payments for part b drugs 
if enacted  these changes to current policy could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents key pipeline developments peginterferon beta a in january  we released the primary efficacy analysis and safety data from our phase study  advance 
results support peginterferon as a potential treatment dosed every two weeks or every four weeks for relapsing remitting ms 
the primary endpoint of advance  annualized relapse rate at one year  was met for both the two week and four week dosing regimens 
results showed that peginterferon also met the secondary endpoints of risk of week confirmed disability progression  proportion of patients who relapsed and magnetic resonance imaging assessments for both dose regimens 
we plan to submit marketing applications for peginterferon in the us and us by mid dexpramipexole at the end of december  we learned that a phase trial investigating dexpramipexole in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als did not meet its primary endpoint  a joint rank analysis of function and survival  and no efficacy was seen in the individual components of function or survival 
the trial also failed to show efficacy in its key secondary endpoints 
based on these results  we have discontinued development of dexpramipexole in als 
long lasting recombinant factors viii and ix in october  we announced positive top line results from the phase study  known as a long  investigating our long lasting recombinant factor viii fc fusion protein in hemophilia a  a rare inherited disorder which inhibits blood coagulation 
we plan to submit a biologics license application to the fda for factor viii in the first half of we submitted a biologics license application to the fda for marketing approval of our long lasting recombinant factor ix fc fusion protein in hemophilia b  a rare inherited disorder which inhibits blood coagulation  during the fourth quarter of the regulatory submission was based on the positive top line results from the phase study known as b long 
pediatric data will be required as part of the marketing authorization applications for factor viii and factor ix that we plan to submit to the ema  and we have initiated two global pediatric studies of factor viii and factor ix 
we collaborate with swedish orphan biovitrum ab on the commercialization of factor viii and factor ix 
for information about this collaboration  please read note  collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
tecfidera in february  we submitted a new drug application to the fda for marketing approval of tecfidera  our oral small molecule candidate for the treatment of ms 
the regulatory submission was based on tecfidera comprehensive development program  in which tecfidera demonstrated significant reductions in ms disease activity coupled with favorable safety and tolerability in the phase define and confirm studies 
the fda accepted our application for tecfidera and granted us a standard review timeline 
in october  we announced that the fda extended the initial pdufa date for its review of our application by three months  which is a standard extension period 
the extended pdufa target date is in late march the fda has indicated that the extension of the pdufa date is needed to allow additional time for review of our application 
the agency has not asked for additional studies 
in march  we submitted a marketing authorisation application for tecfidera to the european medicines agency ema 
the ema has validated our application for review of tecfidera in the eu we have submitted additional regulatory applications for tecfidera in australia  canada and switzerland 
we acquired tecfidera as part of our acquisition of fumapharm ag in for more information about this acquisition and associated milestone obligations  please read the subsection entitled contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contingent consideration subsection of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
avonex pen and dose titration in february  the fda approved two separate dosing innovations designed to improve the treatment experience for patients receiving once a week avonex for relapsing forms of ms avonex pen and a new dose titration regimen 
avonex pen is the first intramuscular autoinjector approved for ms and is designed to enhance the self injection process for patients receiving avonex therapy 
a new dose titration regimen  facilitated by the avostartgrip titration devices  provides patients with the option to gradually increase the dose of avonex at treatment initiation to reduce the incidence and severity of flu like symptoms that patients may experience with therapy 
these avonex dosing innovations are commercially available in the eu  eu and other countries

table of contents gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaled million in  compared to losses recognized of million for and gains recognized of million in we expect avonex to continue facing increased competition in the ms marketplace in both the us and rest of world 
we and a number of other companies are working to develop or have commercialized additional treatments for ms  including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with avonex 
in addition  the continued growth of tysabri and the commercialization of certain of our own pipeline product candidates  such as tecfidera  may negatively impact future sales of avonex 
increased competition also may lead to reduced unit sales of avonex  as well as increasing price pressures particularly in geographic markets outside the us tysabri we collaborate with elan pharma international  ltd elan an affiliate of elan corporation  plc  on the development and commercialization of tysabri

table of contents we expect tysabri to continue facing increased competition in the ms marketplace in both the us and rest of world 
we and a number of other companies are working to develop or have commercialized additional treatments for ms  including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with tysabri 
the commercialization of certain of our own pipeline product candidates  such as tecfidera  also may negatively impact future sales of tysabri 
increased competition may also lead to reduced unit sales of tysabri  as well as increasing price pressure 
in addition  safety warnings included in the tysabri label  such as the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml  and any future safety related label changes  may limit the growth of tysabri unit sales 
we continue to research and develop protocols and therapies that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of pml in patients 
our efforts to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing pml  including through the jcv antibody assay  and other on going or future clinical trials involving tysabri may have a negative impact on prescribing behavior  which may result in decreased product revenues from sales of tysabri 
other product revenues other product revenues are summarized as follows for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages fumaderm fampyra other total other product revenues we have a license from acorda therapeutics  inc acorda to develop and commercialize fampyra in all markets outside the us the european commission previously granted a conditional marketing authorization for fampyra in the eu in july a conditional marketing authorization is renewable annually and is granted to a medicinal product with a positive benefit risk assessment that fulfills an unmet medical need when the benefit to public health of immediate availability outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required 
to meet the conditions of this marketing authorization  we will provide additional data from on going clinical studies regarding fampyra benefits and safety in the long term 
this marketing authorization was renewed as of july fampyra is the first treatment that addresses the unmet medical need of walking improvement in adult patients with ms who have walking disability 
fampyra is commercially available throughout the european union and in canada  australia  new zealand  israel and south korea  and we anticipate making fampyra commercially available in additional markets in in  the german government implemented new legislation to manage pricing related to new drug products introduced within the german market through a review of each product s comparative efficacy 
we launched fampyra in germany in august during the second quarter of  the government agency completed its comparative efficacy assessment of fampyra indicating a range of pricing below our initial launch price  which was unregulated for the first months after launch consistent with german law 
as of the third quarter of  we have had pricing negotiations with the german authorities which were resolved in we recognized revenue during the fourth quarter of based on the lowest point of the initially indicated german pricing authority range 
we will recognize revenue at the negotiated fixed price effective upon the signing of the new agreement in for information about our relationship with acorda  please read note  collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report

increased commercial demand was approximately and in us rituxan unit sales volume for and  respectively  over the prior year comparative periods 
the increase in demand was driven by numerous factors including a continued uptake in the rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis indications 
collaboration costs and expenses for compared to decreased primarily due to a decrease in sales and marketing expenses incurred by the collaboration and a decline in expenditures for the development of rituxan for use in other indications 
for and  we have increased our share of co promotion profits in the us by approximately million and million  respectively  to reflect our interpretation of a proposed rule within the healthcare reform legislation related to changes in the exclusion of orphan drugs under section b of the public health services act 
the cumulative amount of these adjustments is million  which is reflected as an amount due from genentech in our consolidated balance sheets and may be subject to adjustment when a final rule on the provisions of b is issued 
collaboration cost and expenses for compared to were favorably impacted by genentech assuming responsibility for the us sales and marketing efforts for rituxan in the fourth quarter of the savings realized from the consolidation of the sales force in were offset by a charge of approximately million recorded to the collaboration  representing genentech estimate of compensatory damages and interest that might be awarded to hoechst gmbh hoechst  in relation to an intermediate decision by the arbitrator in genentech s ongoing arbitration with hoechst 
as a result of this charge to the collaboration  our share of rituxan revenues from unconsolidated joint business was reduced by approximately million in the second quarter of this million amount reflects our share of the estimate of the loss that we may incur in the event of a final arbitration award unfavorable to genentech 
the actual amount of our share of any damages may vary from this estimate depending on the nature or amount of any damages awarded to hoechst 
for additional information related to this matter  please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements included within this report

this fee is calculated based upon each organization s percentage share of total branded prescription drug sales to qualifying us government programs such as medicare  medicaid and veterans administration va and public health service phs discount programs 
we have reduced our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the us by approximately million in and based upon genentech estimate of the fee that will be assessed to genentech on qualifying sales of rituxan 
under our collaboration agreement  our current pre tax co promotion profit sharing formula  which resets annually  provides for a share of pre tax co promotion profits if co promotion operating profits exceed million 
for   and  the threshold was met during the first quarter 
reimbursement of selling and development expense in the us in the fourth quarter of  we and genentech made an operational decision under which we eliminated our rituxan oncology and rheumatology sales force  with genentech assuming responsibility for the us sales and marketing efforts related to rituxan 
as a result of this change  selling and development expense incurred by us in the us and reimbursed by genentech decreased for in comparison to as discussed in note  collaborative and other relationships to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  genentech incurs the majority of continuing development costs for rituxan 
expenses incurred by genentech in the development of rituxan are not recorded as research and development expense  but rather reduce our share of pre tax co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenues 
for and  amounts received in reimbursement of selling and development expenses in the us were insignificant 
revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world consists of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada 
for compared to  revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world decreased due to the expirations of royalties on a country by country basis offset by a portion of the hoechst charge  noted above  which was recorded as of june  for compared to  revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world decreased due to the expirations of royalties on a country by country basis 
in addition  revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world for were favorably impacted by receipt of million representing the cumulative underpayment of past royalties owed to us on sales of rituxan in the rest of world 
the royalty period for sales in the rest of world with respect to all products is years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis 
the royalty periods for substantially all of the remaining royalty bearing sales of rituxan in the rest of world markets expired during after  we expect revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world will primarily be limited to our share of pre tax co promotion profits in canada 
other revenues other revenues are summarized as follows for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages royalty revenues corporate partner revenues total other revenues royalty revenues we receive royalties from net sales on products related to patents that we licensed 
our most significant source of royalty revenue is derived from net worldwide sales of angiomax  which is licensed to the medicines company tmc 
royalty revenues from the net worldwide sales of angiomax are recognized in an amount equal to the level of net sales achieved during a calendar year multiplied by the royalty rate in effect for that tier under our agreement with tmc 
the royalty rate increases based upon which tier of total net sales are earned in any calendar year 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in royalty revenues reflects an increase in the net worldwide sales of angiomax 
the increase in royalty revenues related to the sale of angiomax for compared to also reflects a million adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of  as net sales levels for achieved a new royalty tier 

table of contents in march  the us patent and trademark office granted the extension of the term of the principal us patent that covers angiomax to december  under the terms of our royalty arrangement for angiomax  tmc is obligated to pay us royalties earned  on a country by country basis  until the later of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of angiomax in such country or the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent in such country 
the annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume based market share 
tmc began selling angiomax in the us in january corporate partner revenues our corporate partner revenues include amounts earned upon delivery of product under contract manufacturing agreements  revenues related to our arrangement with samsung biologics co 
ltd 
samsung biologics to develop  manufacture and market biosimilar pharmaceuticals and supply agreement revenues covering products previously included within our product line that we have sold or exclusively licensed to third parties 
the decrease in corporate partner revenues for compared to  as well as the increase for compared to  is primarily related to a one time cash payment of approximately million received in exchange for entering into an asset transfer agreement in march reserves for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  va and phs discounts  managed care rebates  product returns  and other governmental rebates or applicable allowances including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain international markets where we operate 
reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable if the amount is payable to our direct customer or a liability if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer 
these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
our estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns 
actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates 
if actual results vary  we adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition 
reserves for discounts  contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues are summarized as follows for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages discounts contractual adjustments returns total allowances gross product revenues percent of gross product revenues discount reserves include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives

contractual adjustment reserves relate to medicaid and managed care rebates  va  phs discounts and other government rebates or applicable allowances 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in contractual adjustments was due to higher reserves for managed care and medicaid and va programs principally associated with higher rebates resulting from price increases as well as an increase in governmental rebates and allowances in certain of the international markets in which we operate 
the amount of contractual adjustments as of december  includes our price adjustments related to sales of fampyra described above under the heading other product revenues 

table of contents product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers 
in accordance with contractual terms  wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product 
the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration 
reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction to product sales 
for compared to  return reserves increased primarily due to returns associated with a voluntary withdrawal of a limited amount of avonex product in the first quarter of that demonstrated a trend in oxidation that may have led to expiry earlier than stated on its label as well as price increases 
for compared to  return reserves remained relatively unchanged

for compared to  the increase in cost of sales was driven by higher unit sales volumes  increased contract manufacturing and production costs  and an increase in amounts written down related to excess  obsolete  unmarketable  or other inventory 
these increases were partially offset by the sale of inventory produced under our high titer production process 
cost of sales for also includes increased costs associated with avonex pen  the jcv antibody assay  and sales of fampyra  while cost of sales for included million of period expense related to the shutdown for capital upgrades of our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina rtp 
our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
the expiry associated with our inventory is generally between months and years  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to expiration has historically been insignificant 
inventory amounts written down related to excess  obsolete  unmarketable  or other are charged to cost of sales  and totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

late stage programs are programs in phase development or in registration stage 
early stage programs are programs in phase or phase development 
research and discovery represents costs incurred to support our discovery research and translational science efforts 
other research and development costs consist of indirect costs incurred in support of overall research and development activities and non specific programs  including activities that benefit multiple programs  such as management costs as well as depreciation and other facility based expenses 
for compared to  the increase in research and development expense includes costs incurred in connection with our late and early stage programs  additional investments in our marketed products  an increase in upfront and milestone payments  and costs related to reorganizing a group in our research and development function 
the increase in spending associated with our late stage product candidates was driven by increased clinical trial activity associated with our factor viii  dexpramipexole  and daclizumab product candidates as well as costs incurred in support of commercial preparatory capabilities related to factor viii 
at the end of december  we learned that a phase trial investigating dexpramipexole in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als did not meet its primary endpoint and failed to show efficacy in its key secondary endpoints 
based on these results  we have discontinued development of dexpramipexole in als 
prior to our decision to discontinue dexpramipexole  we had started the r d extension program  envision  and had entered into arrangements with certain suppliers for the purchase of raw materials and the supply of drug product 
these arrangements have been canceled 
we have accrued approximately million of research and development expense  as of december   related to those firm commitments to purchase r d services and inventory or to pay cancellation charges 
research and development expense related to our early stage programs increased over the prior year comparative period primarily due to costs incurred in the advancement of our anti tweak program in lupus nephritis  our biib program for alzheimer s disease  our neublastin program for neuropathic pain  an increase in spending incurred in connection with our collaboration and license agreement with portola pharmaceuticals  inc for the development of the syk inhibitor molecule and development of stx for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis following our recent acquisition of stromedix  inc research and development expense for compared to  reflects our efforts to allocate resources within our research and development organization consistent with our restructuring initiative  which is described under the heading restructuring charge  and resulted in a reduction in spending related to certain programs which were terminated or are in the process of being discontinued 
these decreases were offset by research and development costs associated with initiatives to grow our business  which included increased clinical trial activity for certain of our late stage product candidates  such as dexpramipexole  factor viii  factor ix  and peginterferon 
research and development expense for compared to  also reflects a reduction in milestone and upfront payments recognized within research and development expense 
we intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where the drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated 
specifically  we intend to continue to invest in bringing forward our ms pipeline and in pursuing additional therapies for autoimmune disorders  neurodegenerative diseases and hemophilia as well as make investments to enhance our early stage pipeline

table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages amortization of acquired intangible assets for compared to  as well as for compared to  the change in amortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily driven by the amount of amortization recorded in relation to our avonex core technology asset 
avonex core technology asset our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
our amortization policy reflects our belief that the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our avonex product 
we refer to this amortization methodology as the economic consumption model 
an analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenues of avonex is performed annually during our long range planning cycle which is completed in the third quarter of each year  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption model 
amortization recorded for the first and second quarters of was recorded based upon the results of the analysis 
amortization recorded in the third and fourth quarters of and the first two quarters of was recorded based upon the results of our analysis  which did not result in a significant change in the expected lifetime revenues of avonex from the analysis 
the results of our analysis reflected an increase in the expected lifetime revenue of avonex 
this increase in the expected lifetime revenues of avonex was primarily attributable to changes in expected impact of competitor products 
as a result  amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of and the first two quarters of decreased from those amounts recorded in the previous four quarters 
our most recent long range planning cycle was completed in the third quarter of  which reflected a small decrease in the expected lifetime revenue of avonex 
based upon this analysis  amortization recorded in relation to our core intangible asset for the third and fourth quarters of increased in comparison to amounts recorded in the first half of the estimated future amortization of our core intangible asset related to avonex is expected to be as follows in millions as of december  total we monitor events and expectations regarding product performance 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex determined during our most recent annual review

as part of this initiative we out licensed or terminated certain research and development programs  including those in oncology and cardiovascular medicine  that are no longer a strategic fit for us 
we completed a reduction in workforce spanning our sales  research and development  and administrative functions 
we vacated and recognized the sale of the san diego  california facility as well as consolidated certain of our massachusetts facilities 
as a result of these initiatives  we realized annual operating expense savings of which the substantial majority have been realized within research and development and selling  general and administrative expense 
these savings were offset by costs associated with initiatives to grow our business

income tax provision for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages effective tax rate on pre tax income income tax expense our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations 
the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions  changes in tax laws  the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses  acquisitions  and licensing transactions 
our effective tax rate for compared to decreased primarily as a result of higher orphan drug credits for our factor viii  stx  dexpramipexole and other orphan credit eligible clinical trials  the cessation of certain intercompany royalties owed by a foreign wholly owned subsidiary to a us wholly owned subsidiary on the international sales of one of our products and higher deductions related to our manufacturing activities 
these decreases were partially offset by the correction of an error which had accumulated over several years in our deferred tax accounting for capitalized interest which resulted in an expense of million 
our effective tax rate for compared to decreased primarily due to our license and collaboration agreement with knopp  which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the attribution to noncontrolling interest of million of the associated ipr d charge 
because the attributed amount was not an expense for tax purposes  our tax rate was unfavorably impacted by percentage points 
in addition  during  we experienced an increase in research and development expenditures eligible for the orphan drug credit  a lower effective state tax rate resulting from a change in state law and the settlement of outstanding matters related to state and federal audits 
these favorable items were offset by a higher percentage of our profits being earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions  principally the us  and a non deductible charge for contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of panima

we have continued to consolidate the operations of these entities following our purchase of the noncontrolling interest  however  as of september   we no longer allocate of the earnings of these ventures to net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as biogen domp srl and biogen domp switzerland gmbh became wholly owned subsidiaries of ours

as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters to cambridge  massachusetts  we expect to vacate part of our weston  massachusetts facility in the second half of upon completion of the new buildings and incur a charge between million to million 
this estimate represents our remaining lease obligation for the vacated portion of our weston facility  net of sublease income expected to be received 
in addition  this decision has shortened the expected useful lives of certain leasehold improvements and other assets at our weston facility and will result in approximately million to million of additional depreciation

market risk we conduct business globally 
as a result  our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks which may affect our results of operations  including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations 
while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars  the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results  often in ways that are difficult to predict 
our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of our foreign currency hedging program  which is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact resulting from volatility in exchange rate changes on revenues 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk with the majority of our forward contracts used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies in the next months 
for a more detailed disclosure of our hedges outstanding  please read note  derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our ability to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on revenues and net income diminishes as significant exchange rate fluctuations are sustained over extended periods of time 
other foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations are recognized in the period in which we incur those gains or losses 
pricing pressure global economic conditions continue to present challenges for our industry 
the global economic downturn and the deterioration of credit and economic conditions continue to impact our results of operations  particularly in countries where government sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare 
global economic conditions may be further impacted by additional negative economic developments in countries such as italy  portugal and spain  whose sovereign debt credit ratings have been downgraded 
as a result  many countries worldwide  particularly those within the european union  are reducing their public expenditures in an effort to achieve cost savings 
governments in a number of international markets in which we operate  including germany  france  italy  the united kingdom  portugal and spain have announced or implemented measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs to constrain the overall level of government expenditures 
the implementation of measures varies by country and include  among other things  mandatory rebates and discounts  price reductions and suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals 
certain implemented measures negatively impacted our revenues in and we expect to see continued efforts to achieve additional reductions in public expenditures and consequently expect that our revenues and results of operations will be further negatively impacted if these  similar or more extensive measures are  or continue to be  implemented in these and other countries in which we operate 
based upon our most recent estimates  we expect that such measures will reduce our revenues in by approximately to million 
in addition  certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed 
thus  our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets and limit market growth 
the continued implementation of pricing actions throughout europe may also lead to higher levels of parallel trade 
generally  in the united states there are fewer government imposed constraints on the pricing of pharmaceuticals 
however  given current trends in health care costs  we expect increased focus on overall health care expenditures in and beyond that may result in  among other things  constraints on pharmaceutical pricing  changes in level of rebates and other reimbursement mechanisms  the permissibility of cross border trade  and the use of comparative effectiveness research 

table of contents credit risk we are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales 
the majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the us and europe with concentrations of credit risk limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products  as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas 
our accounts receivable are primarily due from wholesale distributors  public hospitals and other government entities 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
we operate in certain countries where weakness in economic conditions has resulted in extended collection periods 
we continue to monitor these conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets  and assess their possible impact on our business 
our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not been significant 
although our contractual payment terms have not changed  over the past year we noted greater volatility in the amount and timing of collections of accounts receivable balances in certain countries 
in countries where we have experienced a pattern of extended payments and we expect to collect receivables greater than one year from the time of sale  we have discounted our receivables and reduced related revenues over the period of time that we estimate those amounts will be paid using the country s market based borrowing rate for such period 
the related receivables are classified at the time of sale as long term assets 
within the european union  our accounts receivable in spain  italy and portugal continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices 
deteriorating credit and economic conditions have generally led to an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect our accounts receivable in these countries  although these countries have introduced programs to pay down significantly overdue payables 
specifically during the third quarter of  as part of a new program to resolve outstanding amounts long overdue  the portuguese government paid us approximately million  contributing to a decrease in our accounts receivable in portugal 
also during this period  portugal enacted legislation to limit their total expenditure on total pharmaceutical products 
in recognizing revenue in portugal  we have estimated the effect of these caps in determining our price 
similarly  in june  the spanish government paid us approximately million  contributing to a significant decrease in our accounts receivables in spain 
our net accounts receivable balances from product sales in italy  portugal and spain totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  of which million and million were classified as non current and included within investments and other assets within our consolidated balance sheets as of those dates 
approximately million and million of the aggregated balances for these four countries were overdue more than one year as of december  and  respectively 
our balance sheet exposure to greece has been limited as we maintain no investment holdings backed by the greek government and our only receivables in this market are due from our distributor  which totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these receivables remain current and in compliance with their contractual due dates 
however  due to the current uncertainty  we recognize sales in greece on a cash collection basis 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of december  and  respectively 
however  if significant changes occur in the availability of government funding or the reimbursement practices of these or other governments  we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from customers in such countries and our results of operations could be adversely affected

we have historically financed our operating and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows earned through our operations

we believe that existing funds  when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources  if needed  are sufficient to satisfy our operating  working capital  strategic alliance  milestone payment  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives  including acquisition and licensing activities

we also limit our exposure to european sovereign debt securities and maintain no holdings with respect to certain euro zone states  such as portugal  italy  greece  and spain 
the value of our investments  however  may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades in the credit rating of the corporate bonds included in our portfolio  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in declines in the value of the investments 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio if the declines are other than temporary or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost which could adversely impact our financial position and our overall liquidity 
for a summary of the fair value and valuation methods of our marketable securities please read note  fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report

table of contents in  we acquired fumapharm ag 
as part of this acquisition we acquired fumaderm and tecfidera together  fumapharm products 
we paid million upon closing of the transaction and will pay an additional million if a fumapharm product is approved for ms in the us or us we would also be required to make the following additional milestone payments to fumapharm ag based on the attainment of certain sales levels of fumapharm products  less certain costs as defined in the acquisition agreement cumulative sales level prior month sales m b b b each additional b up to b payment amount in millions million million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion these payments will be accounted for as an increase to goodwill as incurred  in accordance with the accounting standard applicable to business combinations when we acquired fumapharm 
payments are due within days following the end of the quarter in which the applicable sales level has been reached and are based upon the total sales of fumapharm products in the prior twelve month period 
financing arrangement in july  we executed leases for two office buildings currently under construction in cambridge  massachusetts with a planned occupancy during the second half of construction of these facilities began in late in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to entities involved with the construction of an asset that will be leased when the construction is completed  we are considered the owner of these properties during the construction period 
accordingly  we record an asset along with a corresponding financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet for the amount of total project costs incurred related to the construction in progress for these buildings through completion of the construction period 
upon completion of the buildings  we will assess and determine if the assets and corresponding liabilities should be derecognized 
as of december  and  cost incurred by the developer in relation to the construction of these buildings totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary 
legal matters for a discussion of legal matters as of december   please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap  requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition and related allowances we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  which is typically upon delivery 
however  sales of tysabri in the us are recognized on the sell through model  that is  upon shipment of the product by elan to its third party distributor rather than upon shipment to elan 
the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business we collaborate with genentech on the development and commercialization of rituxan 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the us  reimbursement of our selling and development expense in the us  and revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world  which consists of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada by f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche and its sublicensees 
pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by genentech in the us and by roche in canada 
pre tax co promotion profits consist of us and canadian sales of rituxan to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture rituxan  third party royalty expenses  and distribution  selling and marketing  and joint development expenses incurred by genentech  roche and us 
we record our share of the pre tax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us on a cash basis 
additionally  our share of the pre tax co promotion profits in the us includes estimates made by genentech and us and those estimates are subject to change 
actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates 
reserves for discounts and allowances we establish reserves for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid and managed care rebates  va and phs discounts  product returns and other governmental discounts or applicable allowances associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of international markets in which we operate 
these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
our estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition 
in addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue  we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management and distribution services 
bad debt reserves bad debt reserves are based on our estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
given our historical experience with bad debts  combined with our credit management policies and practices  we do not presently maintain significant bad debt reserves 
however certain of our customers are based in countries where the economic conditions continue to present challenges 
we continue to monitor these conditions and associated impacts on the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not exceeded management s estimates 
concentrations of credit risk the majority of our receivables arise from product sales in the united states and europe and are primarily due from wholesale distributors  public hospitals and other government entities 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies  and associated impacts on the relevant financial markets and our business  especially in light of the global economic downturn 
the credit and economic conditions within many of the international markets in which we operate  particularly in certain countries throughout europe  such as italy  spain and portugal  have continued to deteriorate throughout these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries 

table of contents in countries where we have experienced a pattern of extended payments and we expect to collect receivables greater than one year from the time of sale  we have discounted our receivables and reduced related revenues over the period of time that we estimate those amounts will be paid using the country s market based borrowing rate for such period 
the related receivables are classified at the time of sale as long term assets 
to date  we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable 
if economic conditions worsen and or the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate  our risk of collectability may increase  which may result in additional allowances and or significant bad debts 
for additional information related to our concentration of credit risk associated with our accounts receivable balances  please read the subsection above entitled credit risk in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
royalty revenues we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we own rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of these licensed products 
there are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties that have been paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to assess the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period in which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material when compared to actual amounts paid by licensees 
to the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenues  we record such revenues on a cash basis 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
we also accrue the costs of ongoing clinical trials associated with programs that have been terminated or discontinued for which there is no future economic benefit at the time the decision is made to terminate or discontinue the program 
consolidation of variable interest entities we consolidate variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
for such consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than of the economics  we record noncontrolling interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the third party equity interests 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  we consider a number of factors  including our ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity s economic success  our contractual rights and responsibilities under the arrangement and the significance of the arrangement to each party 
these considerations impact the way we account for our existing collaborative and joint venture relationships and may result in the future consolidation of companies or entities with which we have collaborative or other arrangements 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined in a manner that approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of multiple pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
capitalization of inventory costs our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process  including any known safety or efficacy concerns  potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to 
table of contents the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
we expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or significant delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies 
as of december   million of our inventory  including costs associated with our tecfidera  serum free avonex  factor viii and factor ix programs  have been capitalized in advance of regulatory approval 
as of december   the carrying value of our inventory did not include any costs associated with products that had not yet received regulatory approval 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods 
obsolescence and unmarketable inventory we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
in the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration  we will record a charge to cost of sales to write down any obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
in all cases  product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value 
acquired intangible assets  including in process research and development we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process research and development product candidates 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we generally engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired 
we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the ipr d analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
effective january   if we are purchasing a business  the acquired ipr d is measured at fair value  capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually until commercialization  after which time the ipr d is amortized over its estimated useful life 
if we acquire an asset or group of assets  that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards  the acquired ipr d is expensed on its acquisition date 
future costs to develop these assets are recorded to expense as they are incurred if the technology lacks alternative future uses 

table of contents impairment and amortization of long lived assets and accounting for goodwill long lived assets other than goodwill long lived assets to be held and used  including property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets  including ipr d and trademarks  totaled approximately  million as of december  and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  as of october  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
when performing our impairment assessment  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to recalculate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if we believe  as a result of the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives is less than its carrying amount  we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above 
if the carrying value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeds its fair value  then the intangible asset is written down to their fair values 
our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
we believe the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our avonex product  which we refer to as the economic consumption amortization model 
this amortization methodology involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated product sales of avonex is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model 
this analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis  such as the anticipated product sales of avonex and avonex related products and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates  as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents 
we completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of we monitor events and expectations regarding product performance 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex determined during our most recent annual review 
we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived assets during  and goodwill goodwill totaled approximately  million as of december   and relates largely to amounts that arose in connection with the merger of biogen  inc and idec pharmaceuticals corporation 
our goodwill balances represent the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually  as of october  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step impairment test 
if we believe  as a result of the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step impairment test is required  otherwise  no further testing is required 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit  then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired 
in each year  the fair value of our reporting unit  which includes goodwill  was significantly in excess of the carry value of our reporting unit 

table of contents investments  including fair value measures and impairments we invest in various types of securities  including short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes  government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset backed securities  in which our excess cash balances are invested 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we have classified our financial assets as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 
as noted in note  fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  a majority of our financial assets have been classified as level these assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services 
the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value  including reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  offers  current spot rates and other industry and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances 
we also have some investments classified as level whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies 
we apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations 
impairment we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are reflected within earnings as an impairment loss 
share based compensation we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our share based compensation arrangements 
changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount of expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment  and includes estimating the expected market price of our stock on vesting date and stock price volatility as well as the term of the expected awards 
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets requires judgment  including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made throughout the performance as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors  these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to materially differ  from our estimates 

table of contents contingent consideration for acquisitions completed after january   we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
each reporting period thereafter  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense within the consolidated statement of income 
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates and periods  updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones  or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
these fair value measurements represent level measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  changes in assumptions described above  could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction s tax laws and regulations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors  that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
as of december   our non us subsidiaries undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings and other basis differences aggregated approximately billion 
we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us  however  if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs  the resultant tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations 
the residual us tax liability  if such amounts were remitted  would be between million to million as of december  contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim  asserted or unasserted  or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
these revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations or maintain distribution relationships in the us  europe  middle east  canada  central and south america  australia  new zealand  japan  china  india and elsewhere in asia in connection with the sale of avonex and tysabri and in germany in connection with the sale of fumaderm 
fampyra is commercially available throughout the european union and in canada  australia  new zealand  israel and south korea 
in addition  we receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through genentech on sales of rituxan in the rest of world 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  primarily with respect to the euro  canadian dollar  swiss franc  danish krone  swedish krona  british pound  and japanese yen 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation 
the majority of our forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items 
we have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items 
the following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in both programs 
as of december  and  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar across all maturities for example  a strengthening of the euro would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
as of december  and  we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million  respectively  to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
the returns from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change 
a basis point adverse movement decrease in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
