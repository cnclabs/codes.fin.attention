item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company continued to execute our primary business plan to acquire new  fuel efficient commercial aircraft from aircraft manufacturers and to lease those aircraft to airlines around the world 
we grew our fleet primarily through the acquisition of aircraft from our new order pipeline supplemented by eight deliveries of new and used aircraft acquired in the secondary market 
we continued to supplement our leasing revenues by providing management services to investors and or owners of aircraft portfolios  for which we receive fee based revenue 
these services include leasing  re leasing  and lease management and sales services  with the goal of helping our clients maximize lease and sale revenues 
during  we entered into long term management servicing agreements for two additional aircraft ending the year with four managed aircraft compared to two as of december  in addition to our leasing activities and management services  and depending on market conditions  we sell aircraft from our fleet 
during  the company sold an aircraft from our fleet and agreed to provide management services for this aircraft 
we ended with aircraft comprised of single aisle narrowbody jet aircraft  twin aisle widebody jet aircraft and turboprop aircraft  with a weighted average age of years 
we ended with aircraft  comprised of single aisle jet aircraft  twin aisle widebody jet aircraft and two turboprop aircraft  with a weighted average age of years 
our fleet grew by based on net book value to billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  the acquisition and lease of additional aircraft led to a increase in our rental revenue to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to the timing of aircraft deliveries the full impact on rental revenue for aircraft acquired during a given period will be reflected in subsequent periods 

table of contents we recorded earnings before income taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
our profitability increased year over year as our pretax profit margin increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our earnings per share more than doubled as we recorded diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of 
during the year ended december  and through february   we entered into binding commitments to acquire up to additional aircraft from airbus  boeing and atr 
from airbus  we agreed to purchase up to a xwb family aircraft  five of which are subject to reconfirmation 
from boeing  we agreed to purchase an additional boeing er aircraft  an additional eight boeing aircraft and up to boeing max aircraft of which are subject to reconfirmation 
deliveries of the additional aircraft we are purchasing from airbus and boeing are scheduled to commence in and to continue through from atr  we agreed to purchase six additional atr aircraft which are scheduled to deliver in and as of december  and through february   we had entered into binding purchase commitments to acquire an aggregate additional aircraft 
we continued successful lease placements of new aircraft from our order book and as of february  we had entered into contracts for the lease of new aircraft which in conjunction with our current fleet of aircraft represent minimum lease rentals of billion 
our fleet we have continued to build one of the world youngest  most fuel efficient aircraft operating lease portfolios 
during the year ended december   we increased our fleet by aircraft ending the year with a total of aircraft of which were new aircraft and were used aircraft 
we also managed four aircraft as of december  our weighted average fleet age as of december  was years 
portfolio metrics of our fleet as of december  and are as follows december  december  dollars in thousands fleet size weighted average fleet age years years weighted average remaining lease term years years aggregate fleet cost weighted average fleet age and remaining lease term calculated based on net book value

table of contents our lease placements are progressing in line with expectations 
as of december  and through february  we have entered into contracts for the lease of new aircraft scheduled to be delivered as follows delivery year number of aircraft number leased leased thereafter total aircraft industry and sources of revenues our revenues are principally derived from operating leases with scheduled and charter airlines 
as of december   and  we derived more than of our revenues from airlines domiciled outside of the us  and we anticipate that most of our revenues in the future will be generated from foreign lessees 
the airline industry is cyclical  economically sensitive  and highly competitive 
airlines and related companies are affected by fuel price volatility and fuel shortages  political and economic instability  natural disasters  terrorist activities  changes in national policy  competitive pressures  labor actions  pilot shortages  insurance costs  recessions  health concerns and other political or economic events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets 
our airline customers ability to react to  and cope with  the volatile competitive environment in which they operate  as well as our own competitive environment  will affect our revenues and income 
demand for air travel has consistently grown in terms of both the number of aircraft and passenger traffic over the last years 
the industry has remained resilient over time  while enduring the effects of both business cycle downturns and external events 
today  air travel has penetrated most world regions  with the highest growth now coming from emerging markets and economies 
while growth rates are lower in more mature markets  there is a substantial need in those markets to replace aircraft reaching the end of their economic useful lives 
the long term outlook for aircraft demand remains robust due to increased passenger traffic and the need to replace aging planes 
the airline industry is cyclical and generally grows along with the economy 
historically  there has been a strong positive correlation between changes in world gross domestic product gdp  measured in us dollars  and changes in passenger traffic as indicated by revenue passenger kilometers rpk  an industry standard measure of passengers flown where each rpk represents one kilometer traveled by a paying customer 
the business cycle effects are such that rpk declines or softens within recessionary periods 
however  aircraft inventory has trended upward consistently  regardless of the economic cycle  as many aircraft are delivered during downturns despite reduced passenger travel 
long term passenger traffic growth is expected to be underpinned by projected growth in demand from emerging markets 
travel growth remains concentrated in the emerging markets of the asia pacific region  latin america and the middle east while the more mature markets in the united states and europe have slower growth rates overall 
the percentage of world traffic attributable to emerging markets has been continuously increasing since the early s 
for example  in  the asia pacific region represented about of the world passenger traffic  and its share was approximately in  the most recent year for which complete data is available 
since  china passenger traffic 
table of contents has grown approximately annually on average to billion rpks in currently  china passenger traffic is the second highest in the world 
avitas forecasts considerably higher growth in through in the asia pacific region  the middle east and latin america  as compared to north america and europe 
in fact  avitas forecasts that by passenger traffic in the asia pacific region will surpass passenger traffic in north america 
for  international air transport association iata has increased its profitability forecast from billion to billion  citing strong airline performance in the second and third quarters of as well as strong passenger traffic growth 
avitas expects these factors to continue in  and iata projects industry profitability to rise to billion 
however  iata cautions that macroeconomic  geopolitical and policy risks such as the euro zone sovereign debt crisis  us fiscal disorder and instability in the middle east could negatively impact airline profitability 
despite industry cyclicality and current economic stresses  we remain optimistic about the long term growth prospects for air transportation as well as the growing role that aircraft leasing  generally  and alc  specifically  will play in facilitating the fleet transactions necessary to support the growth of the airline industry 
liquidity and capital resources overview we finance the acquisition of our aircraft through available cash balances  internally generated funds  including cash flow from operations and proceeds from aircraft sales  and debt financings 
we borrow funds to purchase new and used aircraft  make progress payments on new aircraft purchase commitments and to pay down and refinance maturing debt obligations 
one of our strategic goals since our inception has been and continues to be to finance the company primarily on an unsecured basis 
this provides us with increased operational flexibility when transitioning aircraft from one airline to another and increased financial flexibility 
during the year ended december  and through february   we entered into debt facilities aggregating billion  which included billion in senior unsecured notes  our billion syndicated unsecured credit facility  our million warehouse facility and additional debt facilities aggregating million 
we ended with total debt outstanding of billion compared to billion in we continued to focus on diversifying our banking group to broaden our access to capital and as of december  and through february  had developed a member  globally diversified banking group  which has provided us in excess of billion in financing 
we ended with total unsecured debt outstanding of billion compared to million in  increasing the company unsecured debt as a percentage of total debt to as of december  compared to as of december   while maintaining a composite cost of funds of 
we increased our cash flows from operations by or million to million in as compared to million in our cash flows from operations contributed significantly to our liquidity position 
we ended with available liquidity of billion which is comprised of unrestricted cash of million and undrawn balances under our warehouse facilities and unsecured revolving credit facilities of billion 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy the operating requirements of our business through the next twelve months 
our financing plan for is focused on continuing to raise unsecured debt in the global bank market and through international and domestic capital markets transactions  reinvesting cash flow from operations and to a limited extent through government guaranteed loan programs from the ecas in support of our new airbus aircraft deliveries and the ex im bank in support of our new boeing aircraft deliveries

as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding under our revolving unsecured credit facilities 
the outstanding drawn balances may be rolled until the maturity date of each respective facility and have been presented as such in the contractual obligation schedule above 
future interest payments on floating rate debt are estimated using floating rates in effect at december  
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have not established any unconsolidated entities for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we have  however  from time to time established subsidiaries and created partnership arrangements or trusts for the purpose of leasing aircraft or facilitating borrowing arrangements all of which are consolidated 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and financial statement disclosures  and may require subjective and complex estimates and judgments 
lease revenue we lease flight equipment principally under operating leases and report rental income ratably over the life of each lease 
rentals received  but unearned  under the lease agreements are recorded in rentals received in advance on our consolidated balance sheet until earned 
the difference between the rental income recorded and the cash received under the provisions of the lease is included in lease receivables  as a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
an allowance for doubtful accounts will be recognized for past due rentals based on management assessment of collectability 
our management team monitors all lessees with past due lease payments if any and discusses relevant operational and financial issues facing those lessees with our marketing executives in order to determine an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  if collection is not reasonably assured  we will not recognize rental income for amounts due under our lease contracts and will recognize revenue for such lessees on a cash basis 
should a lessee credit quality deteriorate  we may be required to record an allowance for doubtful accounts and or stop recognizing revenue until cash is received  both of which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our aircraft lease agreements typically contain provisions which require the lessee to make additional rental payments based on either the usage of the aircraft  measured on the basis of hours or cycles flown per month a cycle is one take off and landing  or calendar based time contingent rentals 
these payments represent contributions to the cost of major future maintenance events qualifying events associated with the aircraft and typically cover major airframe structural checks  engine overhauls  the replacement of life limited parts contained in each engine  landing gear overhauls and overhauls of the auxiliary power unit 
these contingent rentals are generally collected monthly based on reports of usage by the lessee or collected as fixed monthly rates 
in accordance with our lease agreements  contingent rentals are subject to reimbursement to the lessee upon the occurrence of a qualifying event 
the reimbursable amount is capped by the amount of contingent rentals received by the company  net of previous reimbursements 
the company is only required to reimburse for qualifying events during the lease term 
the company is not required to reimburse for routine maintenance or additional maintenance costs incurred during a qualifying event 
all amounts of contingent rentals unclaimed by the lessee at the end of the lease term are retained by the company 
we record as rental revenue the portion of contingent rentals that we are virtually certain we will not reimburse to the lessee as a component of rental of flight equipment in our consolidated statement of operations 
contingent rentals which we may be required to reimburse to the lessee are reflected in our overhaul reserve liability  as a component of security deposits and maintenance reserves on flight equipment leases in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents estimating when we are virtually certain that contingent rental payments will not be reimbursed requires judgments to be made as to the timing and cost of future maintenance events 
in order to determine virtual certainty with respect to this contingency  our technical asset management department analyzes the terms of the lease  utilizes available cost estimates published by the equipment manufacturers  and thoroughly evaluates an airline maintenance planning document mpd 
the mpd describes the required inspections and the frequency of those inspections 
our technical asset management department utilizes this information  combined with their cumulative industry experience  to determine when major qualifying events are expected to occur for each relevant component of the aircraft  and translates this information into a determination of how much we will ultimately be required to reimburse to the lessee 
we record contingent rental revenue as the aircraft is operated when we determine that a qualifying event will occur outside the non cancellable lease term or after we have collected contingent rentals equal to the amount that we expect to reimburse to the lessee as the aircraft is operated 
should such estimates be inaccurate  we may be required to reverse revenue previously recognized 
in addition  if we can no longer make accurate estimates with respect to a particular lease  we will stop recognizing any contingent rental revenue until the end of such lease 
all of our lease agreements are triple net leases whereby the lessee is responsible for all taxes  insurance  and aircraft maintenance 
in the future  we may incur repair and maintenance expenses for off lease aircraft 
we recognize overhaul expense in our consolidated statement of operations for all such expenditures 
lessee specific modifications such as those related to modifications of the aircraft cabin are expected to be capitalized as initial direct costs and amortized over the term of the lease into rental revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
flight equipment flight equipment under operating lease is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
purchases  major additions and modifications  and interest on deposits during the construction phase are capitalized 
we generally depreciate passenger aircraft on a straight line basis over a year life from the date of manufacture to a residual value 
changes in the assumption of useful lives or residual values for aircraft could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
at the time flight equipment is retired or sold  the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and the difference  net of proceeds  is recorded as a gain or loss 
our management team evaluates on a quarterly basis the need to perform an impairment test whenever facts or circumstances indicate a potential impairment has occurred 
an assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an aircraft may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an aircraft carrying amount is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the aircraft to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the aircraft 
the undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted leases  future projected lease rates and estimated residual or scrap values for each aircraft 
we develop assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on our knowledge of active lease contracts  current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type  and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry  as well as information received from third party industry sources 
the factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are affected by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates  economic conditions  technology and airline demand for a particular aircraft type 
in the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test  the aircraft will be recorded at fair value in accordance with our fair value policy  resulting in an impairment charge 
deterioration of future lease rates and the residual values of our aircraft could 
table of contents result in impairment charges which could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
to date  we have not recorded any impairment charges 
we record flight equipment at fair value if we determine the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we principally use the income approach to measure the fair value of aircraft 
the income approach is based on the present value of cash flows from contractual lease agreements and projected future lease payments  including contingent rentals  net of expenses  which extend to the end of the aircraft economic life in its highest and best use configuration  as well as a disposition value based on expectations of market participants 
these valuations are considered level valuations  as the valuations contain significant non observable inputs 
stock based compensation to compensate and incentivize our employees and directors  we grant stock based compensation awards 
to date  we have granted stock options stock options and restricted stock units rsus 
all share based payment awards granted have been equity classified awards 
we account for stock options by estimating the grant date fair value of the award as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and amortizing that value on a straight line basis over the requisite service period less any anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of book value rsus is determined based on the closing market price of the company class a common stock on the date of grant  while the fair value of total shareholder return tsr rsus is determined at the grant date using a monte carlo simulation model 
included in the monte carlo simulation model are certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables  such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
to appropriately value the award  the risk free interest rate is estimated for the time period from the valuation date until the vesting date and the historical volatilities are estimated based on a historical timeframe equal to the time from the valuation date until the end date of the performance period 
due to our limited stock history since the completion of our initial public offering on april   historical volatility was estimated based on all available information 
the estimation of the fair value of share based awards requires considerable judgment 
for future awards  we will be required to continue to make such judgments  and while we intend to continue to use the approach discussed above to make key estimates  there can be no assurance that changes in such estimates will not have a significant impact to our results of operations in the future 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when the probability of realization of the full value of the asset is less than 
based on the timing of reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future anticipated taxable income based on lease and debt arrangements in place at the balance sheet date and tax planning strategies available to us  our management considers the deferred tax asset recoverable 
should events occur in the future that make the likelihood of recovery of deferred tax assets less than  a deferred tax valuation allowance will be required that could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we recognize the impact of a tax position  if that position has a probability of greater than that it would be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a probability of more than of being 
table of contents realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
as our business develops  we may take tax positions that have a probability of less than of being sustained on audit which will require us to reserve for such positions 
if these tax positions are audited by a taxing authority  there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of such tax positions will not result in further losses 
such losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition

changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
we are exposed to the market risks described below 
interest rate risk the nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
changes  both increases and decreases  in our cost of borrowing  as reflected in our composite interest rate  directly impact our net income 
our lease rental stream is generally fixed over the life of our leases  whereas we have used floating rate debt to finance a significant portion of our aircraft acquisitions 
as of december   we had billion in floating rate debt 
as of december   we had billion in floating rate debt 
if interest rates increase  we would be obligated to make higher interest payments to our lenders 
if we incur significant fixed rate debt in the future  increased interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of the incurrence of such debt would also increase our interest expense 
if our composite rate were to increase by  we would expect to incur additional interest expense on our existing indebtedness as of december  and december   of approximately million and million  each on an annualized basis  which would put downward pressure on our operating margins 
foreign exchange rate risk the company attempts to minimize currency and exchange risks by entering into aircraft purchase agreements and a majority of lease agreements and debt agreements with us dollars as the designated payment currency 
thus  most of our revenue and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
as of december  and december   and  respectively  of our lease revenues were denominated in euros 
as our principal currency is the us dollar  a continuing weakness in the us dollar as compared to other major currencies should not have a significant impact on our future operating results
