overview we are engaged in the research  development  production and sale of various types of fertilizers and agricultural products in the prc through our wholly owned chinese subsidiaries  jinong  gufeng including gufeng s subsidiary tianjuyuan and our vie  yuxing 
our primary business is fertilizer products  specifically humic acid based compound fertilizer produced by jinong and compound fertilizer  blended fertilizer  organic compound fertilizer  slow release fertilizers  highly concentrated water soluble fertilizers and mixed organic inorganic compound fertilizer produced by gufeng 
in addition  through yuxing  we develop and produce agricultural products  such as top grade fruits  vegetables  flowers and colored seedlings 
for financial reporting purposes  our operations are organized into four business segments fertilizer products jinong  fertilizer products gufeng  agricultural products production yuxing and agricultural products production jintai 
the fertilizer business conducted by jinong and gufeng generated approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended june   and  respectively 
yuxing serves as a research and development base for our fertilizer products 
jintai had served for that function too 
however  as reported in our previous annual and quarterly reports  we started to relocate jintai to the facilities of yuxing due to the deteriorated surrounding environment that caused the death and obsolescence of large amount of jintai s flowers and seedlings 
as a result  jintai has not been in operation since march   when the relocation commenced 
the relocation and its affiliated process are in progress 
fertilizer products as of june   we had developed and produced a total of different fertilizer products in use  of which were developed and produced by jinong and by gufeng

for the year ended june   net sales at gufeng were  a decrease of  or  from  for the year ended june  the fiscal quarter ended march  fell in the export window in which no special tariff tax applied  however  due to the lower demand on nitrogen phosphorous elemented compound fertilizer by importing countries which is arising from the backlog of their imported compound fertilizers in previous quarters  which also led to lower than before profit margin over the export contracts  gufeng had no export contract in the quarter ended march  despite of that  gufeng has been expanding and penetrating the domestic market particularly since the fiscal quarter ended march   during which period no revenue was generated from fertilizer exportation either due to sustained special tariff tax levied by china authority or due to continuously weak demand by importing countries

for the fiscal year ended june   net sales at gufeng were  an increase of  or  from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was due to the increasing demand for the organic inorganic humic acid compound fertilizer products of gufeng  higher average selling price per metric ton for the fiscal year ended june  than the price for the fiscal year ended june   and higher percentage of more expensive humic acid based fertilizers in gufeng s product mix than in the same period in while with increase of in the average unit price per metric ton at gufeng from fiscal year to fiscal year  the total sales volume at gufeng decreased by in metric tons from the fiscal year ended june  to the fiscal year ended june  such decrease in sales volume is mainly attributable to the decrease in gufeng s export sales volume for the fiscal year ended june jintai s net sales decreased by  or  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the same period in the decrease was mainly attributable to jintai s nearby environmental degradation which resulted in its relocation commenced on march  and is still ongoing 
therefore  jintai did not generate any sales revenue since march  for the fiscal year ended june   yuxing s net sales were  an increase of  from  during the fiscal year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the strong sales of yuxing s top grade flowers in the fiscal year  while in the fiscal year yuxing did not have commercialized top grade flowers 
the company s current credit policy allows clients to pay off their receivable balance by up to days from the point the revenue is recognized 
under this policy  for receivable older than days  the company will book allowance toward the outstanding balance immediately 
such a policy became effective since the fiscal quarter period ended march  the extended credit period was referred to in the company s quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended march  the current policy is a revision of the company s previous credit policy  which allowed the clients to pay off receivables up to a shorter period of days  instead of days 
the implementation of the current policy was a result of the change in fertilizer market in the middle of fiscal year it applies to the company s subsidiaries in fertilizer segment  jinong and gufeng 
starting from  the economy in china slowed down 
the demand in the fertilizer market declined from previous year and remained softened toward year end 
in addition  in december  in overseeing the fertilizer market in china  the ministry of finance under the supervision of the state council of the central government of the prc  or the prc authority  raised the export tariff for certain fertilizer products that gufeng exports to in the international market 
while we always keep a balanced mix of our domestic clients and oversea clients  gufeng s export ability was largely expected to be reduced during due to the prohibitively high export tariff imposed 
we then had to rely on domestic clients to fill in the orders that could be under the export contract instead 
to combat the adverse effect of high export tariff  we launched aggressive marketing campaign by forgoing advance payments and offering warehouse credit sales to selected clients 
coupled with the marketing efforts to selected clients  gufeng and jinong  adopted the updated day credit policy for all clients  effective beginning the updated policy eased the payback period and provided much needed liquidity to the constraint clients 
these policy adjustments and marketing tools were approved very essential in time for the company in expanding its sales in the domestic segment and offsetting the negative effect of reduced export capacity up to date

discussion of segment profitability measures as of june   we were engaged in the following businesses the production and sale of fertilizers through jinong and gufeng and the production and sale of high quality agricultural products by yuxing 
for financial reporting purpose  our operations were organized into four main business segments based on locations and products jinong fertilizer production  gufeng fertilizer production  jintai agricultural products production and yuxing agricultural products production 
each of the segments has its own annual budget with regard to development  production and sales 
jintai is in process of combining with yuxing 
each of the four operating segments referenced above has separate and distinct general ledgers 
the chief operating decision maker codm makes decisions with respect to resources allocation and performance assessment upon receiving financial information  including revenue  gross margin  operating income and net income produced from the various general ledger systems  however  net income by segment is the principal benchmark to measure profit or loss adopted by the codm 
for jinong  the net income increased by  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  for gufeng  the net income decreased by  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  jintai is located at the economic and technical development zone the zone in the metro area of the city of xi an 
the zone has been inhabited by a large and dense population and the periphery of jintai has bristled with various industrial factories and utility plants in the latest years 
the zone s concentrated industrial activities and dense population changed the micro bio environment for the growth of jintai agricultural products and disturbed jintai s normal fertilizer research and development 
as of june   the relocation and its affiliated process of jintai is ongoing and there was no revenue from jintai for the year ended june  net loss for jintai for the year ended june  was  for yuxing  the net income increased by  to  for the year ended june  from a net loss of  for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity include cash from operations  borrowings from local commercial banks and net proceeds of offerings of our securities consummated in july and november december collectively the public offerings 
as of june   cash and cash equivalents were  an increase of  or  from  as of june  we intend to use some of the remaining net proceeds from the public offerings  as well as other working capital if required  to acquire new businesses  upgrade production lines and complete yuxing s new greenhouse facilities for agriculture products located on acres of land in hu county  kilometers southeast of xi an city 
we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and positive projected cash flow from operations to support our business growth for the next twelve months to the extent we do not have further significant acquisitions or expansions 
however  if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected  we may be required to seek additional capital and or to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous  which may include additional debt and or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated years ended june  net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities  effect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents  beginning balance  cash and cash equivalents  ending balance  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended june   an increase of  or from  for the year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the increase in depreciation expense and the increase accounts receivable comparing to the change during the year ended june  to the same period in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  was  an increase of  or from  for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to the purchases of plant  property and equipment for jinong 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended june  and totaled  and  respectively  which was attributable to the loan proceeds 
as of june  and  our loans payable were as follows june  june  short term loans payable   total   accounts receivable we had accounts receivable of  as of june   as compared to  as of june   an increase of  or  which is mainly attributable to the implementation of days credit policy 
in order to respond to the cash flow shortage caused by the tightening financing and slowing economy growth encountered by some of our distributors  the company launched such a policy since the third quarter of fiscal year enabling such distributors take full advantage of the day credit terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts in account receivable for the year ended june  was  a decrease of  or from  as of june  and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable was as of june  and as of june  the decrease in the allowance of doubtful accounts were mainly due to lower allowance of account receivables at jinong  which decreased to  as june   comparing  as june  inventories we had an inventory of  as of june   as compared to  as of june   an increase of  or 
the increase was mainly seasonal and due to the replenishing of the inventory level during peak season 
as of june   more than of the inventory was finished goods 
these products are expected to be sold and shipped during the fourth quarter of fiscal year of the economy  weather and uncertainty in price trends caused the postponement of the orders 
advances to suppliers we had advances to suppliers of  as of june  as compared to  as of june   representing an increase of  or 
the increase in the amount of advances to suppliers is mainly due to gufeng s seasonal compound fertilizer business  which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital 
to ensure our ability to deliver compound fertilizer to the distributor timely prior to the planting season  we need to have sufficient raw material in stock to feed the production 
to build up the inventory  we typically make advance payment to the supplier to secure the supply of raw material of basic fertilizer 
our inventory level may fluctuate from time to time  depending how fast the raw material gets consumed and replenished during the production process  and how fast the finished goods get sold 
the replenishment of raw material relies on the management s estimate of numerous factors  including but not limited to  the raw material s future price  and spot price along with their volatility  as well as the seasonal demand and future price of finished fertilizer products 
such estimate may not be accurate  and the purchase decision of raw materials based on the estimate can cause excessive inventories in slow sales and insufficient inventories in peak sales 
accounts payable we had accounts payable of  as of june  as compared to  as of june   representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily due to the payoff of yuxing s outstanding payables incurred during its development and construction during the year period ended june  unearned revenue we had unearned revenue of  as of june  as compared to  as of june   representing a decrease of  or 
the further decrease in unearned revenue is attributable to i the expanded credit sales to selected distributors since jinong and gufeng launched warehouse sales program  which is a customized strategy that requires less or few advanced deposit payment from the participating distributors which were selected based upon their overall business strength  credit worthiness and proven ability to develop local markets  ii the use of the day credit policy 
with offering participating distributors the advantageous sales credit in distributing the fertilizer products  the company concurrently manages more account receivables and less unearned revenue 
tax payable we had taxes payable of  as of june  as compared to  as of june   representing an increase of  or 
this increase was mainly due to the increase in jinong s income tax  which resulted from jinong s increased revenue 
non cash financing activities during the year ended june   we issued  shares of common stock to mr 
tao li  chairman and ceo of the company pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan adopted by the board in august those shares were valued at  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following paragraphs reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the delivery is completed  we have no other significant obligations and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in rmb 
however  we use the us dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of rmb  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that rmb will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the prc 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
except for the us holding companies  all of our consolidated revenues  consolidated costs and expenses  and our assets are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
as of june   our accumulated other comprehensive income was million 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the value of the renminbi against the us dollar and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
since july  the renminbi has not been pegged to the us dollar 
although the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
interest rate risk we deposit surplus funds with chinese banks earning daily interest 
we do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes 
all of our outstanding debt instruments carry fixed rates of interests 
the amount of short term debt outstanding as of june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short term bank loans 
although the interest rates  which are based on the banks prime rates with respect to our short term loans are fixed for the terms of the loans  the terms are typically three to twelve months for short term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal 
there were no material changes in interest rates for short term bank loans renewed during the three months ended june  the original loan term on average is one year  and the remaining average life of the short term loans is nine months 
management monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk  as most of our customers are long term customers with superior payment records 
our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers 
inflation risk inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
