item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  and in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included under item investments please read item  md a investments and notes   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included under item other competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service 
cna competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers 
insurers compete on the basis of factors including products  price  services  ratings and financial strength 
cna must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services 
there are approximately  individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the united states 
based on statutory net written premiums  cna is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the th largest property and casualty insurance organization in the united states 
regulation the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision 
each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents  approving policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports  and regulating capital adequacy and the type  quality and amount of investments permitted 
such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations  which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
in addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators  depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment 
hardy is also supervised by the council of lloyd s  which is the franchisor for all lloyd s operations 
the council of lloyd s has wide discretionary powers to regulate lloyd s underwriting  such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation 
in addition  the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the lloyd s franchise board  which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates 
the european union s executive body  the european commission  is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvency ii that would apply to cna s european operations 
in addition  global regulators  including the united states national association of insurance commissioners  are working with the international association of insurance supervisors iais to consider changes to insurance company supervision 
among the areas being addressed are company and group capital requirements  group supervision and enterprise risk management 
it is not currently clear to what extent or how the activities of the iais will impact cna or us insurance regulation 
domestic insurers are also required by the state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
further  insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments 
guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers 
other insurance related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds  rating bureaus  insurance departments  and workers compensation second injury funds  or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process 

table of contents although the federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways 
these initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals  proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures  terrorism risk mechanisms  federal financial services reforms  various tax proposals affecting insurance companies  and possible regulatory limitations  impositions and restrictions arising from the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  as well as the patient protection and affordable care act  both enacted in various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have  and will continue to  impact cna s industry 
although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry  new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders 
for example  some state legislatures have from time to time considered legislation addressing direct actions against insurers related to bad faith claims 
as a result of this unpredictability in the law  insurance underwriting is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines  professional liability and other specialty coverages 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act expanded the federal presence in insurance oversight and may increase the regulatory requirements to which cna may be subject 
the act s requirements include streamlining the state based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance property or casualty insurance placed from insurers that are eligible to accept insurance  but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state 
the act also established a new federal insurance office within the us department of the treasury 
the act called for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation 
the patient protection and affordable care act and the related amendments in the health care and education reconciliation act may increase cna s operating costs and underwriting losses 
this landmark legislation may lead to numerous changes in the health care industry that could create additional operating costs for cna  particularly with respect to its workers compensation and long term care products

diamond offshore drilling  inc 
diamond offshore drilling  inc diamond offshore is engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the business of operating drilling rigs that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons 
offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated based on market demand 
diamond offshore accounted for  and of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and rigs diamond offshore owns offshore drilling rigs  consisting of semisubmersible rigs  seven jack ups and five dynamically positioned drillships  four of which are under construction with deliveries scheduled for the second and fourth quarters of and the second and fourth quarters of diamond offshore s semisubmersible fleet also includes the ocean onyx and ocean apex  two moored semisubmersible rigs which are under construction and expected to be delivered in the third quarter of and the second quarter of diamond offshore s diverse fleet enables it to offer a broad range of services worldwide in both the floater market ultra deepwater  deepwater and mid water and the non floater  or jack up market 
a floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling unit that floats and does not rest on the seafloor 
this asset class includes self propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs 
semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members 
such rigs operate in a semi submerged position  remaining afloat  off bottom  in a position in which the lower hull is approximately feet to feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface 
semisubmersible rigs hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning dp to keep the rig on location  or with anchors tethered to the seabed 
although dp semisubmersibles are self propelled  such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats  non dp  or moored  semisubmersible rigs require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations 
a drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel which is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull 
drillships are typically self propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a dp system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs 
diamond offshore s floater fleet semisubmersibles and drillships can be further categorized based on the nominal water depth for each class of rig as follows category rated water depth a in feet number of units in fleet ultra deepwater  to  b deepwater  to  c mid water to  d a rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed to operate 
however  individual rigs are capable of drilling  or have drilled  in marginally greater water depths depending on conditions such as salinity of the ocean  weather and sea conditions 
b includes four drillships under construction 
c includes two rigs to be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of diamond offshore s existing mid water floaters 
d includes three rigs which are being marketed for sale 
jack up rigs are mobile  self elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor 
diamond offshore s jack ups are used for drilling in water depths from feet to feet 
the water depth limit of a particular rig is able to operate is principally determined by the length of the rig s legs 
the rig hull includes the drilling equipment  jacking system  crew quarters  loading and unloading facilities  storage areas for bulk and liquid materials  heliport and other related equipment 
a jack up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea  as a vessel  with its legs retracted 
once over a drillsite  the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until they are firm and stable  and resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the surface of the water 
after completion of drilling operations  the hull is lowered until it rests in the 
table of contents water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite 
all of diamond offshore s jack up rigs are equipped with a cantilever system that enables the rig to extend its drilling package over the aft end of the rig 
fleet enhancements and additions diamond offshore s long term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced  efficient and high tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices  and otherwise by enhancing the capabilities of its existing rigs at a lower cost and reduced construction period than newbuild construction would require 
diamond offshore has contracted with hyundai heavy industries co 
ltd  for the construction of four dynamically positioned  ultra deepwater drillships 
diamond offshore expects the aggregate cost for the four drillships  including commissioning  spares and project management costs  to be approximately billion 
construction has begun on two moored semisubmersible rigs designed to operate in water depths up to  feet 
the rigs will be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of diamond offshore s mid water floaters and the aggregate cost of the two rigs is estimated to be approximately million  including commissioning  spares and project management costs 
in february of  diamond offshore announced that one of its mid water floaters  the ocean patriot  will undergo enhancements to enable the rig to work in the north sea at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately million 
the enhancement project is expected to begin during the third quarter of with completion expected in early diamond offshore will evaluate further rig acquisition and upgrade opportunities as they arise 
however  diamond offshore can provide no assurance whether  or to what extent  it will continue to make rig acquisitions or upgrades to its fleet 
markets the principal markets for diamond offshore s contract drilling services are the following south america  principally offshore brazil  australia and asia  including malaysia  indonesia  thailand and vietnam  the middle east  including kuwait  qatar and saudi arabia  europe  principally in the united kingdom uk and norway  east and west africa  the mediterranean basin  including egypt  and the gulf of mexico  including the us and mexico 
diamond offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide 
from time to time diamond offshore s fleet operates in various other markets throughout the world 
diamond offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in many respects 
for example  diamond offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the uk has been beneficial in australia and other international areas in which diamond offshore operates  while production experience it has gained through its brazilian and north sea operations has potential application worldwide 
additionally  diamond offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market area enables it to better understand that customer s needs and better serve that customer in different market areas or other geographic locations 
drilling contracts diamond offshore s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions 
diamond offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process  although it is not unusual for diamond offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations 
drilling contracts generally provide for a basic fixed dayrate regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well 
drilling contracts may also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when 
table of contents drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather conditions or other circumstances 
under dayrate contracts  diamond offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig  including wages and the cost of incidental supplies 
historically  dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of diamond offshore s revenues 
in addition  from time to time  diamond offshore s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance 
the duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells  which diamond offshore refers to as a well to well contract  or a fixed period of time  in what diamond offshore refers to as a term contract 
many drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party to the contract 
certain of diamond offshore s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice  and in most circumstances  this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer 
the contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time  generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension 
customers diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
during  and  diamond offshore performed services for  and different customers 
during  and  one of diamond offshore s customers in brazil  petr leo brasileiro sa petrobras  a brazilian multinational energy company that is majority owned by the brazilian government  accounted for  and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues 
ogx petr leo e g s ltda 
ogx  a privately owned brazilian oil and natural gas company  accounted for  and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues in each of the years ended december   and no other customer accounted for or more of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues during  or brazil is one of the most active floater markets in the world today 
currently  the greatest concentration of diamond offshore s operating assets is offshore brazil  where it has rigs contracted 
diamond offshore s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore brazil is billion  billion  billion and million for the years   and competition despite consolidation in recent years  the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants  none of which at the present time has a dominant market share 
the industry may also experience additional consolidation in the future  which could create other large competitors 
some of diamond offshore s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than diamond offshore 
diamond offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have almost mobile rigs available worldwide 
the offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors  including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas  current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas  expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs 
drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
customers may also consider rig availability and location  a drilling contractor s operational and safety performance record  and condition and suitability of equipment 
diamond offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
diamond offshore competes on a worldwide basis  but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time 
competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis  as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved  at a cost that may be substantial  from one region to another 
it is characteristic of the offshore contract drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates 
significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition 

table of contents governmental regulation diamond offshore s operations are subject to numerous international  foreign  us  state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations  including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and clean up under some circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change  carbon emissions or energy use

table of contents competition boardwalk pipeline competes with numerous other pipelines that provide transportation  storage and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems 
boardwalk pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to new natural gas supply sources that are being developed closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas 
in addition  regulators continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of boardwalk pipeline s traditional customers 
as a result of regulators policies  capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with boardwalk pipeline s natural gas pipeline services 
further  natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to boardwalk pipeline s customers  including electricity  coal  fuel oils and alternative fuel sources 
the principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity  rates  terms of service  access to gas supplies  flexibility and reliability of service 
in many cases  the elements of competition  in particular flexibility  terms of service and reliability  are key differentiating factors between competitors 
this is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer term basis 
boardwalk pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems to meet the demands of customers  such as power generators and industrial users  and is continually reviewing its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options 
seasonality boardwalk pipeline s revenues can be affected by weather  natural gas price levels and natural gas price volatility 
weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation  which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across boardwalk pipeline s pipeline systems 
colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs  both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput 
while traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months driven by heating needs  the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues 
in  approximately of boardwalk pipeline s revenue was recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
governmental regulation ferc regulates boardwalk pipeline s natural gas operating subsidiaries under the natural gas act nga of and the natural gas policy act ngpa of ferc regulates  among other things  the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension  enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction 
where required  boardwalk pipeline s natural gas interstate subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by ferc covering certain of their facilities  activities and services 
the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline s subsidiaries operating under ferc s jurisdiction  for all aspects of the natural gas transportation services it provides  are established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
the maximum rates that may be charged by boardwalk pipeline for storage services on texas gas  with the exception of services associated with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system  are established through ferc s cost of service rate making process 
key determinants in ferc s cost of service rate making process are the costs of providing service  the volumes of gas being transported  the rate design  the allocation of costs between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
ferc has authorized boardwalk pipeline to charge market based rates for its firm and interruptible storage services for the majority of its storage facilities 
none of boardwalk pipeline s ferc regulated entities has an obligation to file a new rate case 
boardwalk pipeline is also regulated by the us department of transportation dot under the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended by title i of the pipeline safety act of ngpsa and the hazardous liquids pipeline safety act of hlpsa  which regulates safety requirements in the design  construction  operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas and ngl pipeline facilities 
boardwalk pipeline has received authority from the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa  an agency of dot  to operate certain natural gas pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to of the pipe s specified minimum yield strength smys 
operating at higher than normal operating pressures will allow each of these pipelines to transport all of the volumes boardwalk pipeline has contracted for with its customers 
phmsa retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for boardwalk pipeline to operate these natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures 
phmsa has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline 
table of contents segments located in highly populated areas 
the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty  and job creation act of act was enacted in and increased maximum civil penalties for certain violations to  per violation per day  and from a total cap of million to million 
in addition  the act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of phmsa through september   and directs the secretary of transportation to undertake a number of reviews  studies and reports  some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking 
a number of the provisions of the act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and or operating costs 
boardwalk pipeline s operations are also subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment 
such regulations impose  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances into the environment 
environmental regulations also require that boardwalk pipeline s facilities  sites and other properties be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities

during  highmount recorded negative net reserve revisions of bcfe primarily due to a reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to the non proved category because these reserves were no longer economical due to the decrease in natural gas prices 
also  bcfe of non proved reserves were promoted to the proved undeveloped category as a result of the drilling activity 
during  highmount spent million to convert bcfe from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves through drilling 
as of december   there were no proved undeveloped locations that had remained undeveloped for five years or more 
estimated net quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves at december   and and changes in the reserves during  and are shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item highmount s sonora properties typically have relatively long reserve lives and high well completion success rates 
based on december  proved reserves and highmount s average production from these properties during  the average reserve to production index of highmount s proved reserves is years 

table of contents in order to replenish reserves as they are depleted by production  and to increase reserves  highmount develops its existing acreage by drilling new wells and  where available  employing new technologies and drilling strategies designed to enhance production from existing wells 
in addition  highmount seeks to acquire additional acreage in its core areas of operation  as well as other locations where its management has identified an opportunity

as of december   leases covering   and  of highmount s net acreage will expire by december   and  if production is not established or highmount takes no other action to extend the terms 
production and sales please see the production and sales statistics table for additional information included in the md a under item highmount utilizes its own marketing and sales personnel to market the natural gas and oil that it produces to large energy companies and intrastate pipelines and gathering companies 
production is typically sold and delivered directly to a pipeline at liquid pooling points or at the tailgates of various processing plants  where it then enters a pipeline system 
permian basin natural gas sales prices are primarily at a houston ship channel index 
to manage the risk of fluctuations in prevailing commodity prices  highmount enters into commodity and basis swaps and other derivative instruments 
wells as of december   highmount had working interests in  gross producing wells  net producing wells located primarily in the permian basin 
in addition  highmount had royalty interests in approximately wells located in the permian basin 
wells located in the permian basin have a typical well depth in the range of  to  feet 
competition highmount competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business  including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods  services and labor  including drilling rigs and well completion services 
highmount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and oil 
some of highmount s competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than highmount 
factors that affect highmount s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds  available information about the property and standards established by highmount for minimum projected return on investment 
natural gas and oil also compete with alternative fuel sources  including heating oil and coal 

table of contents governmental regulation all of highmount s operations are conducted onshore in the united states 
the us oil and gas industry  and highmount s operations  are subject to regulation at the federal  state and local level 
such regulation includes requirements with respect to  among other things permits to drill and to conduct other operations  provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations  the location of wells  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  the valuation and payment of royalties  the size of drilling and spacing units regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area  the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties  maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells  venting or flaring of natural gas  and the ratability of production and the operation of gathering systems and related assets 
highmount uses hydraulic fracturing to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas 
in recent years  concerns have been raised that the fracturing process may  among other things  contaminate underground sources of drinking water 
the conference committee report for the department of the interior  environment  and related agencies appropriations act for fiscal year requested the united states environmental protection agency epa to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing  particularly the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water 
in december of the epa issued a progress report of the projects the epa is conducting as part of the study 
a final draft report is expected to be released for public comment and peer review in several bills have been introduced in congress seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing  which has historically been regulated at the state level  though none of the proposed legislation has been passed into law 
highmount believes that similar bills will continue to be introduced in congress and a number of federal agencies are analyzing  or have been requested to review  a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing  however  highmount cannot predict whether any such bill will be passed into law or  if passed  the substance of any such new law 
the federal energy policy act of amended the nga to prohibit natural gas market manipulation by any entity  directed the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the sale or transportation of physical natural gas and significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga of  the ngpa of  or ferc regulations or orders thereunder 
in addition  highmount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the dot and state agencies with respect to safety and operating conditions 
highmount s operations are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment  the generation  storage  transportation and disposal of contaminants  and the protection of public health  natural resources  wildlife and the environment 
in most instances  the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products  water and air pollution control procedures  and the remediation of petroleum product contamination 
in addition  highmount s operations may require it to obtain permits for  among other things  air emissions  discharges into surface waters  and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non hazardous oilfield wastes 
highmount could be required  without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal  to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes  to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination 
in september of  the epa adopted regulations under the clean air act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual greenhouse gas ghg emissions by certain large us ghg emitters 
affected companies are required to monitor their ghg emissions and report to the epa 
oil and gas exploration and production companies that emit more than  metric tons of ghg per year from any facility as defined in the regulations  including highmount  are required to monitor and report emissions for facilities that meet the emissions threshold 
highmount filed its first ghg report in september of for the reporting year 
properties in addition to its interests in oil and gas producing properties  highmount leases an aggregate of approximately  square feet of office space in houston  texas  which includes its corporate headquarters  and approximately  square feet of office space in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
highmount also leases other surface rights and office  warehouse and storage facilities necessary to operate its business 
in addition to leased properties  highmount also owns a  square foot office building in sonora  texas  and a  square foot office building in morrison  oklahoma

risk factors 
our business faces many risks 
we have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face 
there may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries 
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or equity and or the business  results of operations  financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries 
you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the sec or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us 
our subsidiaries  cna financial corporation  diamond offshore drilling  inc and boardwalk pipeline partners  lp  are public companies and file reports with the sec 
you are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  cna financial corporation if cna determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses  cna may need to increase its insurance reserves 
cna maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses  including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process  for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits 
reserves represent cna s best estimate at a given point in time 
insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by cna  generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events  many of which are highly uncertain  such as estimates of claims severity  frequency of claims  mortality  morbidity  discount rates  inflation  claims handling  case reserving policies and procedures  underwriting and pricing policies  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement 
mortality is the relative incidence of death 
morbidity is the frequency and severity of illness  sickness and diseases contracted 
many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on cna s part 
as trends in underlying claims develop  particularly in so called long tail or long duration coverages  cna is sometimes required to add to its reserves 
this is called unfavorable net prior year 
table of contents development and results in a charge to earnings in the amount of the added reserves  recorded in the period the change in estimate is made 
these charges can be substantial 
cna is also subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal  judicial  social  economic and other environmental conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on cna s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims  resulting in further increases in cna s reserves 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include the effects of worldwide economic conditions  which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of certain claims including both directors and officers d o and errors and omissions e o insurance claims related to corporate failures  as well as other coverages  class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices  and mass tort claims  including bodily injury claims related to welding rods  benzene  lead  noise induced hearing loss  injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals  and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  cna reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
if estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason  the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient 
these charges could be substantial 
cna s key assumptions used to determine reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts could vary significantly from actual experience 
cna s reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity  mortality  policy persistency the percentage of policies remaining in force and discount rates which are impacted by expected investment yields 
a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in cna s reserving may result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting policy obligations  which may require changes to reserves 
these assumptions  while based on historical data and industry experience and monitored consistently  are critical bases for reserve estimates and are inherently uncertain 
if estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason  the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient 
these charges could be substantial 
catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses 
catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of cna s business 
various events can cause catastrophe losses 
these events can be natural or man made  and may include hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  severe winter weather  fires  and acts of terrorism 
the frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable 
in addition  longer term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change  a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures  and includes effects on global weather patterns  greenhouse gases  sea  land and air temperatures  sea levels  rain  hail and snow 
the extent of cna s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas  the frequency and severity of the events themselves  the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded and reinsurance reinstatement premiums  if any 
as in the case of catastrophe losses generally  it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to cna to be finally determined  as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs  including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures  additional living expenses  infrastructure disruption  business interruption and reinsurance collectibility 
reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited 
table of contents circumstances  especially in regard to unconventional terrorism acts  such as nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological attacks 
as a result  catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate 
as cna s claim experience develops on a specific catastrophe  cna may be required to adjust its reserves  or take unfavorable net prior year development  to reflect revised estimates of the total cost of claims 
cna has exposure related to a ep claims  which could result in material losses 
cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to a ep claims 
cna s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to a ep claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims 
additionally  traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for a ep 
as a result  estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported a ep claims is subject to a higher degree of variability 
on august   cna completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy a ep liabilities were ceded to national indemnity company nico  a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc  subject to an aggregate limit of billion loss portfolio transfer 
if the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not fully perform their obligations  cna s liabilities for a ep claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of billion  or cna determines it has exposures to a ep claims not covered by the loss portfolio transfer  cna may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against cna s earnings 
these charges could be substantial 
cna s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance 
cna purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk 
under cna s ceded reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of cna s exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection cna purchases  which affects the level of its business and profitability  as well as the level and types of risk cna retains 
if cna is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable  cna may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments 
cna may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers which could result in higher net incurred losses 
cna has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves 
the ceding of insurance does not  however  discharge cna s primary liability for claims 
as a result  cna is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
in the past  certain of cna s reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of cna s contractual relationship 
such action increases the likelihood that cna will not be able to recover amounts due 
in addition  reinsurers could dispute amounts which cna believes are due to it 
if cna is not able to collect the amounts due from reinsurers for any of the foregoing reasons  its net incurred losses will be higher 
cna may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by policyholders who hold deductible policies which could result in higher net incurred losses 
a portion of cna s business is written under deductible policies 
under these policies  cna is obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible  which may be significant 
as a result cna is exposed to credit risk to the policyholder 
if cna is not able to collect the amounts due from policyholders  its incurred losses will be higher 

table of contents cna has incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets 
cna s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  credit and currency risks  many of which are unpredictable 
investment returns are an important part of cna s overall profitability 
general economic conditions  changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates  credit conditions and currency  commodity and stock prices  and many other factors beyond cna s control can adversely affect the value of its investments and the realization of investment income 
further  cna invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed income investments 
in addition  limited partnership investments generally present  higher illiquidity than fixed income investments 
as a result of all of these factors  cna may not realize an adequate return on its investments  may incur losses on sales of its investments  and may be required to write down the value of its investments 
cna s valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment which is inherently uncertain 
cna exercises significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values  which are primarily provided by third parties  for securities in its investment portfolio including those that are not regularly traded in active markets 
cna also exercises significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other than temporary 
the valuation of residential and commercial mortgage and other asset backed securities can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in collateral performance 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these judgments  cna may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other than temporary write downs of its investments are required 
cna is subject to capital adequacy requirements and  if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements  regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit cna from operating its business 
insurance companies such as cna are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention 
these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset  premium and reserve components of statutory capital and surplus reported in cna s statutory basis of accounting financial statements 
current rules  including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as lloyd s  require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable regulatory capital adequacy formula 
if cna does not meet these minimum requirements  cna may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business 
if cna is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or the occurrence of an event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio  cna may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital 
while we have provided cna with substantial amounts of capital in prior years  we may be restricted in our ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to cna in the future 
if cna is in need of additional capital  cna may be required to secure this funding from sources other than us 
cna may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all 
cna s insurance subsidiaries  upon whom cna depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs  are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends 
cna is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends  loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations 
ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction 
the formula for the majority of domestic states is the greater of of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income  less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment 
some jurisdictions including certain domestic states  however  have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year s earned surplus 
if cna is restricted  by regulatory rule or otherwise  from paying or receiving inter company dividends  cna may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash 
as a result  cna would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all 

table of contents rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of cna and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all 
ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
cna s insurance company subsidiaries  as well as cna s public debt  are rated by rating agencies  namely  am best company am best  moody s investors service  inc moody s and standard poor s s p 
ratings reflect the rating agency s opinions of an insurance company s or insurance holding company s financial strength  capital adequacy  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders 
due to the intense competitive environment in which cna operates  the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for cna to take material unfavorable net prior year development in the future  and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies  the rating agencies may take action to lower cna s ratings in the future 
if cna s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels  cna s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the severity of the impact on cna s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and  for certain products  which rating agency takes the rating action 
among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers  the inability to sell a material volume of cna s insurance products to certain markets  and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves 
in addition  it is possible that a lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on cna s ratings  independent of any change in cna s circumstances 
cna has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds 
the ratings triggers are generally more than one level below cna s current ratings 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  diamond offshore drilling  inc diamond offshore s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry  which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices 
diamond offshore s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production in markets worldwide 
worldwide demand for oil and gas  oil and gas prices  market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity 
however  higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since diamond offshore s customers project development time  reserve replacement needs  as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to affect demand for diamond offshore s rigs 
oil and gas prices have been  and are expected to continue to be  extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond diamond offshore s control  including worldwide demand for oil and gas  the level of economic activity in energy consuming markets  the worldwide economic environment or economic trends  such as recessions  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  commonly called opec  to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production in non opec countries  the worldwide political and military environment  including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the middle east  other oil producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  
table of contents civil unrest  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves  available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation and refining capacity  the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital  weather conditions  natural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling  such as oil spills  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves  development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources  competition for customers drilling budgets from land based energy markets around the world  domestic and foreign tax policy  and advances in exploration and development technology 
diamond offshore s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to significant losses and significant damage claims 
diamond offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect diamond offshore 
diamond offshore s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  unstable or faulty sea floor conditions  fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes 
the occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations  damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel  damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations  and oil spillage  oil leaks  well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires  any of which could cause significant environmental damage 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal drilling conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages 
consistent with industry practice  diamond offshore s contracts with its customers generally contain contractual rights to indemnity from its customer for  among other things  pollution originating from the well  while diamond offshore retains responsibility for pollution originating from the rig 
however  diamond offshore s contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by itself  its subcontractors and or suppliers and diamond offshore s customers may dispute  or be unable to meet  their contractual indemnification obligations 
diamond offshore maintains liability insurance  which includes coverage for environmental damage  however  because of contractual provisions and policy limits  diamond offshore s insurance coverage may not adequately cover its losses and claim costs 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable when they are determined to be the result of criminal acts 
also  diamond offshore does not typically purchase loss of hire insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work 
moreover  insurance costs across the industry have increased following the macondo incident and  in the future  certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly and may become less available or not available at all 

table of contents diamond offshore believes that the policy limit under its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for its business 
however  if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds diamond offshore s coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its insurance policies  or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity  it could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
there can be no assurance that diamond offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains  that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify diamond offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify diamond offshore against all of these risks 
in addition  no assurance can be made that diamond offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that diamond offshore will be able to obtain insurance against some risks 
diamond offshore s industry is highly competitive and cyclical  with intense price competition 
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants  none of which at the present time has a dominant market share 
some of diamond offshore s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than it does 
the drilling industry has experienced consolidation in the past and may experience additional consolidation  which could create additional large competitors 
drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job  however  rig availability and location  a drilling contractor s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered 
diamond offshore s industry has historically been cyclical 
there have been periods of lower demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates  followed by periods of high demand  short rig supply and high dayrates 
diamond offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles 
periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of diamond offshore s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable 
significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs could also intensify price competition 
based on analyst reports  diamond offshore believes that there are approximately floaters on order and scheduled for delivery between and  with approximately of these rigs scheduled for delivery in and the resulting increases in rig supply could be sufficient to depress rig utilization and intensify price competition from both existing competitors  as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market 
not all of the rigs currently under construction have been contracted for future work  which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur 
the majority of the floaters on order are dynamically positioned drilling rigs  which further increases competition with diamond offshore s fleet in certain circumstances  depending on customer requirements 
in brazil  petrobras  which accounted for approximately of diamond offshore s consolidated revenues in and  as of february   accounted for approximately billion of contract drilling backlog through and to which nine of diamond offshore s floaters are currently contracted  has announced plans to construct locally new ultra deepwater drilling units to be delivered beginning in these new drilling rigs  if built  would increase rig supply and could intensify price competition in brazil as well as other markets as they enter the market  would compete with  and could displace  diamond offshore s deepwater and ultra deepwater floaters coming off contract and could materially adversely affect diamond offshore s utilization rates  particularly in brazil 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized 
as of february   diamond offshore s contract drilling backlog was approximately billion for contracted future work extending  in some cases  until generally  contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments  however  from time to time  diamond offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been  but are expected to be  executed 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond its control or that diamond offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement in cases where one does not currently exist 
in addition  diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be able to or 
table of contents willing to fulfill their contractual commitments 
diamond offshore s inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or its customers inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s business 
diamond offshore relies heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on its financial results 
diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
in  diamond offshore s five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for of its consolidated revenues 
diamond offshore expects petrobras and ogx  which accounted for approximately and of diamond offshore s consolidated revenues in  to continue to be significant customers in diamond offshore s contract drilling backlog  as of february   includes billion  or and million or of its contracted backlog for  which is attributable to contracts with petrobras and ogx for operations offshore brazil 
petrobras has announced plans to construct locally  new ultra deepwater drilling units to be delivered beginning in these new drilling units  if built  would compete with  and could displace  diamond offshore s deepwater and ultra deepwater floaters coming off contract and could materially adversely affect utilization rates  particularly in brazil 
while it is normal for diamond offshore s customer base to change over time as work programs are completed  the loss of  or a significant reduction in the number of rigs contracted with  any major customer may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s business 
the terms of diamond offshore s drilling contracts may limit its ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market 
the duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and  to a lesser extent  the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors 
in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs  drilling contractors generally prefer longer term contracts  but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates  to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization  while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates 
conversely  in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs  contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates 
in contrast  during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level 
an inability to obtain longer term contracts in a declining market or to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market through shorter term contracts may limit diamond offshore s profitability 
contracts for diamond offshore s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts  and increases in diamond offshore s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability on those contracts 
diamond offshore s contracts for its drilling rigs provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day  although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred by diamond offshore 
many of diamond offshore s operating costs  such as labor costs  are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond diamond offshore s control 
the gross margin that diamond offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in diamond offshore s operating costs over the terms of the contracts 
in addition  for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses  diamond offshore may be unable to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers 
diamond offshore s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond its control 
diamond offshore s customers may terminate some of their term drilling contracts if the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if diamond offshore has to suspend drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  some of diamond offshore s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts 
these termination payments may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of a contract 
in addition  the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time 
during periods of depressed market conditions  diamond offshore may be subject to an increased risk of its customers seeking to repudiate their contracts 
diamond offshore s 
table of contents customers ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts may also be adversely affected by restricted credit markets and economic downturns 
if diamond offshore s customers cancel some of their contracts  and diamond offshore is unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of contracts are renegotiated  it could materially and adversely affect diamond offshore s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
significant portions of diamond offshore s operations are conducted outside the united states and involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations 
diamond offshore operates in various regions throughout the world which may expose it to political and other uncertainties  including risks of war and civil disturbances  piracy or assaults on property or personnel  kidnapping of personnel  expropriation or nationalization of property or equipment  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  changing political conditions  imposition of trade barriers or import export quotas  foreign and domestic monetary policies  the inability to repatriate income or capital  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions  travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats  difficulties in supplying  repairing or replacing equipment or transporting personnel in remote locations  difficulties in obtaining visas or work permits for employees on a timely basis  and changing taxation policies 
diamond offshore is subject to the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control and other us laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to worldwide anti bribery laws 
in addition  international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which diamond offshore operates  including laws and regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling rigs  import export quotas or other trade barriers  repatriation of foreign earnings or capital  oil and gas exploration and development  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  and 
table of contents use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors 
some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors  require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these practices may adversely affect diamond offshore s ability to compete in those regions 
it is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry 
the actions of foreign governments may materially and adversely affect diamond offshore s ability to compete 
in addition  the shipment of goods  including the movement of a drilling rig across international borders  subjects diamond offshore to extensive trade laws and regulations 
diamond offshore s import activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations that differ in each of the countries in which diamond offshore operates and often impose record keeping and reporting obligations 
the laws and regulations concerning import export activity and record keeping and reporting requirements are complex and change frequently 
these laws and regulations may be enacted  amended enforced and or interpreted in a manner that could materially and adversely impact diamond offshore s operations 
shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons  some of which may be outside of diamond offshore s control 
shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled downtime for rigs 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil penalties  economic sanctions  seizure of shipments and or the contractual withholding of monies owed to diamond offshore  among other things 
diamond offshore may enter into drilling contracts that exposes it to greater risks than it normally assumes 
from time to time  diamond offshore may enter into drilling contracts with national oil companies  government controlled entities or others that expose it to greater risks than it normally assumes  such as exposure to greater environmental or other liability and more onerous termination provisions giving the customer a right to terminate without cause or upon little or no notice 
upon termination  these contracts may not result in a payment to diamond offshore  or if a termination payment is required  it may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of a contract 
in addition  the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time 
for example  diamond offshore currently operates  and expects to continue to operate  its drilling rigs offshore mexico for pemex exploraci n y producci n pemex  the national oil company of mexico 
the terms of these contracts expose diamond offshore to greater environmental liability than it normally assumes  and provide that  among other things  each contract can be terminated by pemex on short notice  contractually or by statute  subject to certain conditions 
while diamond offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks  it can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a material negative impact on future operations or financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses 
due to diamond offshore s international operations  diamond offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency 
diamond offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise 
diamond offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings 
certain of diamond offshore s international rigs are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited doil  a wholly owned cayman islands subsidiary of diamond offshore 
it is diamond offshore s intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of doil and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities 
diamond offshore does not expect to provide for us taxes on any future earnings generated by doil  except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to us federal income tax 
should a future 
table of contents distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary  diamond offshore may be required to record additional us income taxes 
rig conversions  upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns 
from time to time  diamond offshore adds new capacity through conversions or upgrades to existing rigs or through new construction  such as its four  ultra deepwater drillships under construction and its construction of the ocean apex and ocean onyx 
projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors  including the following shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  work stoppages  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  unanticipated cost increases  weather interferences or storm damage  difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions  design and engineering problems  availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations  customer acceptance delays  shipyard failures or unavailability  and failure or delay of third party service providers  civil unrest and labor disputes 
failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time  or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may  in some circumstances  result in the delay  renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract  resulting in a loss of contract drilling backlog and revenue to diamond offshore 
if a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances  diamond offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract with equally favorable terms 
diamond offshore has elected to self insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the gom 
because the amount of insurance coverage available to diamond offshore has been limited  and the cost for such coverage is substantial  diamond offshore has elected to self insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the gom 
this results in a higher risk of losses  which could be material  that are not covered by third party insurance contracts 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  boardwalk pipeline partners  lp boardwalk pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long term basis 
each year  a portion of boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced 
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring contracts 
a key driver that influences the rates and terms of its transportation contracts is the current and anticipated basis spreads generally meaning the difference in the price of natural gas at receipt and delivery points on its natural gas pipeline systems which influence how much 
table of contents customers are willing to pay to transport gas between those points 
basis differentials can be affected by  among other things  the availability and supply of natural gas  competition from other pipelines  including pipelines under development  available transportation and storage capacity  storage inventories  regulatory developments  weather and general market demand in markets served by its pipeline systems 
as new sources of natural gas have been identified and developed  changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and market areas have occurred 
as a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply  basis spreads on its pipeline systems have narrowed over the past several years  reducing the transportation rates boardwalk pipeline can negotiate with its customers on contracts due for renewal for its firm transportation services 
the narrowing of basis differentials has also adversely affected the rates it is able to charge for its interruptible and short term firm transportation services 
as a result  the rates boardwalk pipeline is able to obtain on renewals of expiring contracts are generally lower than those under the expiring contracts  which adversely impacts its revenues and distributable cash 
the development of large new gas supply basins in the us and the overall increase in the supply of natural gas created by such development can significantly affect boardwalk pipeline s business 
growing supplies of natural gas are being produced in new production areas that are not connected to boardwalk pipeline s system and are closer to large end user market areas than the supply basins connected to its system that traditionally served these markets 
for example  gas produced in the marcellus shale in pennsylvania  new york  west virginia and ohio is being shipped to nearby northeast markets such as new york and philadelphia which have traditionally been served by gas produced in gulf coast and mid continent production areas which are connected to its pipelines 
this has caused and may continue to cause gas produced in supply areas connected to its system to be diverted to other market areas which may adversely affect capacity utilization and transportation rates on its systems 
in addition  as discussed above  growing supplies of natural gas from developing supply basins  especially shale plays  connected to boardwalk pipeline s system have caused and may continue to cause basis spreads to narrow 
all of these dynamics continue to impair boardwalk pipeline s ability to renew or replace existing contracts or to sell interruptible and short term firm transportation services at attractive rates  which adversely impacts boardwalk pipeline s revenues and distributable cash flows 
changes in the price of natural gas and ngls impacts supply of and demand for those commodities  which impacts boardwalk pipeline s business 
natural gas prices in the us are currently lower than historical averages driven by the abundant and growing gas supply discussed above 
the prices of natural gas and ngls fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors  including worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions  the relationship between the available supplies and the demand for natural gas and ngls  new supply sources  the availability of adequate transportation capacity  storage inventory levels  the price and availability of oil and other forms of energy  the effect of energy conservation measures  the nature and extent of  and changes in  governmental regulation  new regulations adopted by the epa for example greenhouse gas legislation and taxation  and the anticipated future prices of natural gas  oil and other commodities 

table of contents it is difficult to predict future changes in natural gas and ngl prices 
however  the economic environment that has existed over the last several years generally indicates a bias toward continued downward pressure on natural gas prices 
sustained low natural gas prices could negatively impact producers including those directly connected to boardwalk pipeline s pipelines that have contracted for capacity with them 
conversely  future increases in the price of natural gas could make alternative energy sources more competitive and reduce demand for natural gas 
a reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on boardwalk pipeline s systems  reduce the demand for its services and could result in the non renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire and affect its midstream businesses 
boardwalk pipeline may not have sufficient available cash  to continue making distributions to unitholders at the current distribution rate or at all 
the amount of cash boardwalk pipeline can distribute to its unitholders  including us  principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations and financing activities and the amount of cash it requires  or determines to use  for other purposes  all of which fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors 
many of these factors are beyond the control of boardwalk pipeline 
some of the factors that influence the amount of cash boardwalk pipeline has available for distribution in any quarter include the level of capital expenditures it makes or anticipates making  including for expansion and growth projects  the cost and form of payment for pending or anticipated acquisitions and growth or expansion projects and the commercial success of any such initiatives  the amount of cash necessary to meet its current or anticipated debt service requirements and other liabilities  fluctuations in working capital needs  its ability to borrow funds and or access capital markets to fund operations or capital expenditures  including acquisitions  restrictions contained in its debt agreements  and fluctuations in cash generated by its operations  including as a result of the seasonality of its business  customer payment issues and general business conditions such as  among others  contract renewals  basis spreads  market rates  and fluctuations in pal revenues 
boardwalk pipeline may determine to reduce or eliminate distributions at any time it determines that its cash reserves are insufficient or are otherwise required to fund current or anticipated future operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  growth or expansion projects or other business needs 
any such reduction would reduce the amount of cash available to us 
investments that boardwalk pipeline makes  whether through acquisitions or growth projects  that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce its distributable cash flows 
boardwalk pipeline plans to continue to grow and diversify its business by among other things  investing in assets through acquisitions and organic growth projects 
its ability to grow  diversify and increase distributable cash flows will depend  in part  on its ability to close and execute on accretive acquisitions and projects 
any such transaction involves potential risks that may include  among other things the diversion of management s and employees attention from other business concerns  inaccurate assumptions about volume  revenues and costs  including potential synergies  a decrease in liquidity as a result of boardwalk pipeline using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project  
table of contents a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if boardwalk pipeline incurs additional debt to finance the acquisition or project  inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt  an inability to hire  train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets  unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas  and changes in regulatory requirements 
additionally  acquisitions contain the following risks an inability to integrate successfully the businesses it acquires  the assumption of unknown liabilities for which boardwalk pipeline is not indemnified  for which its indemnity is inadequate or for which its insurance policies may exclude from coverage  limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller  and customer or key employee losses of an acquired business 
boardwalk pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
boardwalk pipeline s exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas or other products owed by customers for imbalances or product loaned by it to them under certain of its services 
for boardwalk pipeline s ferc regulated business  boardwalk pipeline s tariffs only allow it to require limited credit support in the event that its transportation customers are unable to pay for its services 
if any of its significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by them or contracted for with them  or to repay the product they owe them  it could have a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipeline s business 
in addition  as contracts expire  the credit or financial failure of any of its customers could also result in the non renewal of contracted capacity  which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
boardwalk pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues 
the loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in its revenues 
boardwalk pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues 
its largest customer in terms of revenue  devon gas services  lp  represented over of its revenues 
boardwalk pipeline s top ten customers comprised approximately of its revenues in boardwalk pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts with key customers on favorable terms which could materially reduce its contracted transportation volumes and the rates it can charge for its services 

table of contents boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to ferc s rate making policies which could limit its ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines  including earning a reasonable return 
boardwalk pipeline is subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates it can charge for its natural gas transportation and storage operations 
for boardwalk pipeline s cost based services  ferc establishes both the maximum and minimum rates it can charge 
the basic elements that ferc considers are the costs of providing service  the volumes of gas being transported  the rate design  the allocation of costs between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to recover all of its costs  including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity  through existing or future rates 
customers or ferc can challenge the existing rates on any of boardwalk pipeline s pipelines 
such a challenge against them could adversely affect its ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in its costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return 
if any of boardwalk pipeline pipelines under ferc jurisdiction were to file a rate case  or if they have to defend their rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or ferc  boardwalk pipeline would be required  among other things  to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in its cost of service is just and reasonable 
under current ferc policy  since it is a limited partnership and does not pay us federal income taxes  this would require it to show that its unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to federal income taxation 
to support such a showing  boardwalk pipeline s general partner may elect to require owners of its units to re certify their status as being subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by boardwalk pipeline or may attempt to provide other evidence 
boardwalk pipeline can provide no assurance that the evidence it might provide to ferc will be sufficient to establish that its unitholders or their ultimate owners are subject to us federal income tax liability on the income generated by boardwalk pipeline s jurisdictional pipelines 
if boardwalk pipeline is unable to make such a showing  ferc could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by its pipelines  which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels 
pipeline safety laws and regulations requiring the performance of integrity management programs or the use of certain safety technologies could subject boardwalk pipeline to increased capital and operating costs and require it to use more comprehensive and stringent safety controls 
boardwalk pipeline s pipelines are subject to regulation by the dot under the ngpsa with respect to natural gas and the hlpsa with respect to ngls  both as amended 
the ngpsa and hlpsa govern the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of natural gas and ngls pipeline facilities 
these amendments have resulted in the adoption of rules by the dot  through phmsa  that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs  including more frequent inspections  correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas  such as high population areas  areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage  and commercially navigable waterways 
these regulations have resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs 
due to recent highly publicized incidents on certain pipelines in the us  it is possible that phmsa may develop more stringent regulations 
boardwalk pipeline could incur significant additional costs if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented 
the act was enacted and signed into law in early under the act  maximum civil penalties for certain violations have been increased to  per violation per day  and from a total cap of million to million 
in addition  the act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of phmsa through september   and directs the secretary of transportation to undertake a number of reviews  studies and reports  some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking 
a number of the provisions of the act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and or operating costs 

table of contents boardwalk pipeline needs to maintain authority from phmsa to operate portions of its pipeline systems at higher than normal operating pressures 
boardwalk pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which utilize the design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets  assuming that boardwalk pipeline operates those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures up to of the pipeline s smys 
boardwalk pipeline has authority from phmsa to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures  however phmsa retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority 
if phmsa were to withdraw or materially modify such authority  boardwalk pipeline may not be able to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on its pipeline assets and could incur significant additional costs to re obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations 
risks related to us and our subsidiary  highmount exploration production llc highmount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels 
replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital expenditures 
highmount s success depends largely upon its ability to find  develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless highmount replaces the reserves produced through successful development  exploration or acquisition  its proved reserves will decline over time 
highmount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 
highmount makes a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of reserves 
highmount s net cash flows have been negatively impacted by reduced natural gas and ngl prices as well as increased drilling costs developing highmount s oil reserves 
if highmount s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget  there can be no assurance that financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements 
estimates of natural gas and oil reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
estimating the volume of proved natural gas and oil reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  commodity prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from highmount s estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of highmount s reserves 
in addition  highmount may adjust estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history  results of exploration and development drilling  prevailing commodity prices and prevailing development expenses 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate representation of their value 
if commodity prices remain depressed  highmount may be required to take additional write downs of the carrying values of its properties 
highmount may be required  under full cost accounting rules  to write down the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties 
a number of factors could result in a write down  including continued low commodity prices  a substantial downward adjustment to estimated proved reserves  a substantial increase in estimated development costs  or deterioration in exploration results 
it is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices 
however  the abundance of natural gas supply discoveries over the last few years would generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices 
highmount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities 
under full cost accounting  highmount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum  or ceiling  of the book value of 
table of contents highmount s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value discounted at the required rate of of the future net cash flows from proved reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges  calculated using the average first day of the month price for the preceding month period 
if the net book value of highmount s exploration and production e p properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability exceeds its ceiling limitation  highmount will impair or write down the book value of its e p properties 
highmount recorded a ceiling test impairment charge in each quarter of  totaling million after taxes for the year ended december  as a result of declines in natural gas and ngl prices 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
depending on the magnitude of any future impairment  a ceiling test write down could significantly reduce highmount s income  or produce a loss 
natural gas  oil and other commodity prices are volatile 
the commodity price highmount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
if the current low price environment for natural gas continues  highmount s results of operations will be lower as well 
highmount is subject to risks due to frequent and possibly substantial fluctuations in commodity prices 
ngl prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile  and highmount expects this volatility to continue 
the markets and prices for natural gas and oil depend upon factors beyond highmount s control 
these factors include  among others  economic and market conditions  domestic production and import levels  storage levels  basis differentials  weather  government regulations and taxation 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that highmount can produce economically 
highmount engages in commodity price hedging activities 
the extent of highmount s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of highmount s hedging activities 
to the extent highmount hedges its commodity price risk  highmount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor 
furthermore  because highmount has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of its natural gas and oil production  highmount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion 
highmount s actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than highmount estimates at the time it enters into derivative transactions for that period 
as a result  highmount s hedging activities may not be as effective as highmount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows  and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows 
in addition  even though highmount s management monitors its hedging activities  these activities can result in substantial losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement or if the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective 
risks related to us and our subsidiaries generally in addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries  as discussed above  we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to  among other things  terrorism  hurricanes and other natural disasters  competition  government regulation  dependence on key executives and employees  litigation  dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws 
acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries 
future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad  as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the united states and its allies  could have a significant impact on the assets and businesses of certain of our subsidiaries 
cna issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act 
terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism  including increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of oil and gas  could affect the market for diamond offshore s drilling services  boardwalk pipeline s transportation  gathering and storage services and highmount s exploration and production 
table of contents activities 
in addition  future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm loews hotels 
while our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets  there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates 
our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal  state and local governmental regulations 
the businesses operated by our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal  state and local governmental regulations which impose or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies 
governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies 
risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following cna 
the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of cna s policyholders rather than its investors 
each jurisdiction in which cna does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate its business 
in addition  the lloyd s marketplace sets rules under which its members  including cna s hardy syndicate operate 
these rules and regulations include the following standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on cna s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired  insolvent or failed private or quasi governmental insurers  licensing of insurers and agents  approval of policy forms  limitations on the ability of cna s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  and limitations on the ability to non renew  cancel or change terms and conditions in policies 
regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
cna may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible 
each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and is generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction

the offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and  accordingly  is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally 
diamond offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures for additional equipment to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
it is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to diamond offshore s operating costs or result in a reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment  or may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity 

table of contents in the aftermath of the macondo well blowout in april of and the subsequent investigation into the causes of the event  new rules have been implemented for oil and gas operations in the gom and in many of the international locations in which diamond offshore operates  including new standards for well design  casing and cementing and well control procedures  as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system sems 
new regulations may continue to be announced  including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment  such as blowout preventer and well control systems and lifesaving systems as well as rules regarding employee training  engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third party audits of sems programs 
such new regulations could require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment  or require new equipment  and could increase diamond offshore s operating costs and cause downtime for its rigs if it is required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections  or if it is required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections  to meet any such new requirements 
diamond offshore is not able to predict the likelihood  nature or extent of additional rulemaking  nor is it able to predict the future impact of these events on operations 
additional governmental regulations concerning licensing  taxation  equipment specifications  training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of diamond offshore s operations  and enhanced permitting requirements as well as escalating costs borne by its customers could reduce exploration activity in the gom and therefore demand for its services 
governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions  the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry 
the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic  environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect diamond offshore s operations by limiting drilling opportunities 
boardwalk pipeline 
boardwalk pipeline s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by ferc and the dot among other federal and state authorities 
in addition to ferc rules and regulations related to the rates boardwalk pipeline can charge for its services  federal regulations extend to pipeline safety  operating terms and conditions of service  the types of services boardwalk pipeline may offer  construction or abandonment of facilities  accounting and record keeping  and relationships and transactions with affiliated companies 
these regulations can adversely impact boardwalk pipeline s ability to compete for business  construct new facilities  including by increasing the lead times to develop projects  offer new services  or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines 
highmount 
all of highmount s operations are conducted onshore in the united states 
the us oil and gas industry  and highmount s operations  are subject to regulation at the federal  state and local level 
such regulation includes requirements with respect to  among other things permits to drill and to conduct other operations  provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations  the location of wells  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  the valuation and payment of royalties  the size of drilling and spacing units regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area  the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties  maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells  venting or flaring of natural gas  and the ratability of production and the operation of gathering systems and related assets 
changes in these regulations  which highmount cannot predict  could be harmful to highmount s business and results of operations 
hydraulic fracturing is a technique commonly used by oil and gas exploration companies  including highmount  to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas by injecting fluids and sand into underground wells at high pressures  causing fractures or fissures in the geological formation which allow oil and gas to flow more freely 
in recent years  concerns have been raised that the fracturing process and disposal of drilling fluids may contaminate underground sources of drinking water 
the conference committee report for the department of the interior  environment  and related agencies appropriations act for fiscal year requested the epa to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing  particularly the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water 
in december of the epa issued a progress report of the projects the epa is conducting as part of the study 
a final draft report is expected to be released for public comment and peer review in several bills were introduced in the th and th congresses seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing  which has historically been regulated at the state level  though none of the proposed legislation was passed into law 
similar bills may be introduced in the 
table of contents current congress and a number of federal agencies are analyzing  or have been requested to review  a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing 
if hydraulic fracturing is banned or significantly restricted by federal regulation or otherwise  it could impair highmount s ability to economically drill new wells  which would reduce its production  revenues and profitability 
highmount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the dot and state agencies with respect to safety and operating conditions 
phmsa has established minimum federal safety standards for certain gas gathering lines 
phmsa has indicated that changes to the current regulatory framework are needed to address gas exploration and production activities 
if implemented  the new changes could impact highmount s ability to transport some of its natural gas or cause highmount to incur additional costs 
our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws 
our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  many of which have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability  which could be substantial  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person 
for example  diamond offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations  including for conduct of or conditions caused by others 
highmount is subject to extensive environmental regulation in the conduct of its business  particularly related to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products  water and air pollution control procedures  and the remediation of petroleum product contamination 
boardwalk pipeline is also subject to laws and regulations  including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities  restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste  requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination and requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements 
we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change 
as awareness of climate change issues increases  governments around the world are beginning to address the matter 
this may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us  our subsidiaries and their suppliers and customers 
we and our subsidiaries may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change  carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas  thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon based fuel and related services provided by our energy subsidiaries 
governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources  such as wind power and solar energy  which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas 
in addition  changing global weather patterns have been associated with extreme weather events and could change longer term natural catastrophe trends  including increasing the frequency and severity of hurricanes and other natural disasters which could increase future catastrophe losses at cna and damage to property  disruption of business and higher operating costs at diamond offshore  boardwalk pipeline  highmount and loews hotels 
there is currently no federal regulation that limits ghg emissions in the us however  several bills were introduced in congress in recent years that would regulate us ghg emissions under a cap and trade system 
although these bills were not passed into law  some regulation of that type may be enacted in the us in the near future 
in addition  in the epa adopted regulations under the clean air act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual ghg emissions by operators of facilities that emit more than  metric tons of ghg per year  which includes boardwalk pipeline and highmount 
numerous states and several regional multi state climate initiatives have announced or adopted plans to regulate ghg emissions  though the state programs vary widely 
the establishment of a ghg reporting system and registry may be a first step toward broader regulation of ghg emissions 
compliance with future laws and regulations could impose significant costs on affected companies or adversely affect the demand for and the cost to produce and transport hydrocarbon based fuel  which would adversely affect the businesses of our energy subsidiaries 

table of contents any significant interruption in the operation of critical computer systems could materially disrupt operations 
we and our subsidiaries have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses 
we are dependent upon operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our businesses 
any failure of our or our subsidiaries computer systems  or those of our or their customers  vendors or others with whom we and they do business  could materially disrupt business operations 
computer and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes  including among others  storms and other natural disasters  terrorist attacks  utility outages or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded 
in addition  it has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted so called cyber attacks on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems  disrupt operations and  in some cases  steal data 
any cyber attacks that affect our or our subsidiaries facilities could have a material adverse effect on our and their business or reputation 
loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect personal information could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations 
we and our subsidiaries rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the united states and abroad 
these include  for example  vendors of computer hardware  software and services  as well as other critical materials and services 
if one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products or services  or fails to protect our proprietary information  including in some cases personal information of employees  customers or hotel guests  we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business or reputation 
we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
most notably  we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at diamond offshore  natural gas and oil properties at highmount  pipeline equipment at boardwalk pipeline and hotel properties owned by loews hotels 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and estimate each unit s fair value as of the testing date 
we calculate the fair value of our reporting units each of our principal operating subsidiaries based on estimates of future discounted cash flows  which reflect management s judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk adjusted discount rate  future industry conditions and operations and other factors 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken 
we are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
we rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock 
our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to make funds available to us  whether in the form of loans  dividends or otherwise 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to  among other things  the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries  applicable state laws  including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of cna  laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies  and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders 

table of contents we could have liability in the future for tobacco related lawsuits 
as a result of our ownership of lorillard  inc lorillard prior to the separation of lorillard from us in the separation  from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco related lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco related suits  notwithstanding the completion of the separation 
in the separation agreement entered into between us and lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the separation  lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to lorillard s tobacco business  including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco related litigation against us 
an adverse decision in a tobacco related lawsuit against us could  if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible  in whole or in part  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and equity 
we do not expect that the separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco related claims 
we do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco related claims  and we have never been held liable for any such claims
