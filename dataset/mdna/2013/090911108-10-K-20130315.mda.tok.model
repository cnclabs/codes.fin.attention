our licensed dental imaging equipment and other related products are designed to improve diagnoses  applications  and procedures in dentistry and medicine 
we offer two categories of laser system products waterlase systems and diode systems 
our flagship product category  the waterlase system  uses a patented combination of water and laser energy to perform most procedures currently performed using dental drills  scalpels  and other traditional dental instruments for cutting soft and hard tissue 
we also offer our diode laser systems to perform soft tissue  pain therapy  and cosmetic procedures  including teeth whitening 
we currently have approximately issued and pending us and international patents  the majority of which are related to our core waterlase technology and dental and medical lasers 
since  we have sold over  waterlase systems  including more than  waterlase md and iplus systems  and more than  laser systems in over countries around the world 
we currently operate in a single reportable business segment 
we had net revenues of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  and we had net losses of million  million  and million for the same periods 
we were originally formed as societe endo technic  sa set in in marseilles  france  to develop and market various endodontic and laser products 
in  set merged into pamplona capital corp  a public holding company incorporated in delaware 
in  we changed our name to biolase technology  inc and to biolase  inc 
in since  our primary objective has been to be the leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of laser systems for the dental industry 
recent developments product offerings in october  we expanded the line of dental imaging products by executing a definitive five year agreement with copenhagen based shape corporation shape  making the company a distributor of shape s trios intra oral cad cam scanning technologies for digital impression taking solutions in the us and canada 
among other capabilities  the trios offers on screen visualization of the impressions with online communication with dental laboratories 
we are currently selling this product as a distributor under the manufacturer s regulatory market clearances 
in september  we introduced the epic  which received the ce mark in late september and which received fda k clearance in october this innovative diode laser provides versatility with soft tissue surgery  teeth whitening  and pain therapy capabilities in a portable and convenient design with pre set and customizable settings 
weighing only two and a half pounds  the epic diode laser has watts of power 
the epic v series launching in is based on the epic platform with software and delivery adaptations enabling a wide range of veterinary applications  including surgical  dental  and pain therapy procedures 
we anticipate further expansion of the epic diode laser into additional medical markets in 
table of contents in february  we introduced the waterlase mdx line  a new product line of all tissue lasers which expands the company s product offerings and complements the industry leading waterlase iplus all tissue dental laser system 
two models of the waterlase mdx are available 
the watt waterlase mdx improves on biolase s time tested waterlase md platform with an updated user interface  a new laser engine and a new lightweight and more flexible titanium fiber cable 
the waterlase mdx increases the power output to watts and cuts hard tissue up to percent faster than the waterlase mdx the waterlase mdx is upgradeable in the field to the mdx performance level 
in february  we introduced newtom cone beam three dimensional d imaging products  manufactured by cefla dental group  which we distribute in the united states and canada 
the newtom d product line will complement the biolase davinci imaging dental imaging devices and provide our dental customers a wider and more comprehensive choice of configurations  range of performance  and price points 
the newtom imaging products are typically used in highly complex dentistry cases by periodontists  endodontists  and oral surgeons where more involved and more accurate images are required 
we believe that they are increasingly being adopted by general practitioners for use in placing implants 
we are currently selling these products as a distributor under the manufacturer s k clearances 
we initially introduced dental imaging products in july under the biolase davinci imaging name 
in january  we introduced the waterlase iplus  a powerful and intuitive dual wavelength all tissue dental laser system 
we believe the iplus is our most significant advancement in all tissue laser technology since we introduced the waterlase md in the waterlase iplus received fda k clearance in the united states in august and received european ce mark approval in february credit facilities established on may   we entered into two revolving credit facility agreements with comerica bank the credit agreements  as amended on august   amendment no 
 which provide for borrowings against certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory  as set forth in the million revolving credit facility agreement the domestic revolver  and borrowings against certain export related accounts receivable and inventory  as set forth in the million revolving credit facility agreement the ex im revolver  for a combined aggregate commitment of borrowings of up to million 
the credit agreements mature on may  and are secured by substantially all of our assets now owned or hereinafter acquired 
the credit agreements require compliance with certain financial and non financial covenants  as defined therein 
if a default occurs  comerica bank may declare the amounts outstanding under the credit agreements immediately due and payable 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
termination of master distribution agreement on september   we entered into a distribution and supply agreement with henry schein  inc hsic  effective august   the d s agreement  which terminated all prior agreements with hsic 
under the d s agreement  we granted hsic certain non exclusive distribution rights in north america and several international markets with respect to our dental laser systems  accessories  and related support and services in certain circumstances 
in addition  we granted hsic exclusivity in selected international markets subject to review of certain performance criteria 
in connection with the d s agreement  hsic placed two irrevocable purchase orders totaling million for our products 
the first purchase order  totaling million  was for the purchase of ilase systems and was fully satisfied during the first quarter of the second purchase order  totaling million  was for the purchase of a combination of laser systems and was fully satisfied during the third quarter of the d s agreement granted hsic a security interest in our inventory and assets  including our intellectual property 
on april   we completed a transaction with hsic the termination agreement whereby we purchased hsic s inventory of waterlase md turbo laser systems for approximately million and hsic released its liens on our assets  including our inventory and intellectual property 
as part of the termination agreement  we reacquired md turbo laser systems at a cost well below market 
pursuant to the terms of the 
table of contents transaction  the entire purchase price was paid by offsetting certain accounts receivable currently due from hsic from sales made in the normal course of business 
none of the funds used to offset the purchase price were related to the original sales of the md turbo laser systems that were purchased 
as a result of the transaction  we are no longer required to fulfill certain future service obligations and  accordingly  derecognized approximately  of accounts receivable due from hsic related to support services previously provided and approximately  of accrued warranties during the quarter ended march  during the quarter ended june   the company reversed accrued sales and marketing service liabilities of approximately  because the liability was extinguished with the closing of the termination agreement 
during the year ended december   we sold all laser systems purchased under this arrangement at margins consistent with our comparable laser products 
industry background general dental procedures are performed on hard tissue  such as bone and teeth  and soft tissue  such as gum and other oral tissue 
a american dental association ada survey of dental services rendered the ada study has estimated that more than million hard tissue procedures are performed annually in the united states 
hard tissue procedures include cavity preparation  root canals and other procedures involving bone or teeth 
the ada study also indicated that more than million soft tissue procedures are performed annually in the united states 
soft tissue procedures include operations such as gum line alteration 
according to statistics compiled in the ada s study  over of hard tissue procedures and of soft tissue procedures in the united states are performed by general dentists and the rest are performed by oral surgeons  endodontists  periodontists  and other specialists 
the ada estimated that the demand for dental services in the united states will continue to grow due to population growth and the increased awareness of the benefits associated with preventive dentistry in reducing the incidence of oral and systemic disease 
we believe there is a growing awareness among consumers of the value and importance of a healthy smile and its connections to overall systemic health 
as such  the dental industry has entered an era of growth and consideration of advanced technologies that allow dentists to perform simple or complex cosmetic dental procedures with minimal trauma  improved patient acceptance and clinically superior results 
we believe our product offerings correspond with this trend  and we expect incremental growth from these pressures in the marketplace 
traditional dental instruments dentists and other specialists choose from a variety of instruments depending on the tissue involved and the type of procedure 
most procedures require the use of multiple instruments to achieve the desired result 
high speed drills 
most dentists use high speed drills for hard tissue procedures  such as preparing cavities for filling and gaining access for performing root canals or shaving and contouring oral bone tissue 
potentially adverse effects associated with drills include thermal heat transfer  vibration  pressure and noise 
the cutting and grinding action of high speed drills can cause damage to the patient s dental structure 
the trauma caused to the surrounding tissues can lead to increased recovery times and the need for future crowns and root canals 
additionally  this grinding action of high speed drills may weaken the tooth s underlying structure  leading to fractures and broken cusps 
procedures involving high speed drills typically require anesthesia 
because many dentists do not recommend anesthetizing more than one or two quadrants of the mouth in a single session  patients may need to return several times to complete their treatment plan 
further  based on the results of several recent studies  autoclaving fails to completely decontaminate dental burs and approximately of these sterilized burs carry pathogenic micro organisms  which may be transferred from patient to patient 

table of contents cutting instruments 
soft tissue procedures  such as reshaping gum lines and grafting on new gum tissue  are typically performed by oral surgeons or periodontists using scalpels  scissors  and other cutting tools 
due to the pain and discomfort associated with procedures performed with these instruments  most soft tissue procedures require the use of local anesthetic which results in numbness and discomfort  and often require stitches 
the use of scalpels  scissors  and other cutting tools typically cause bleeding  post operative swelling  and discomfort 
bleeding can impair the practitioner s visibility during the procedure  thereby reducing efficiency and is a particular problem for patients with immune deficiencies or blood disorders  and patients taking blood thinning medications 
film radiography equipment 
since the early twentieth century  dentists have relied on radiographic images produced by exposing photographic film to x ray radiation as part of the examination and diagnosis of patients 
these x ray images can help reveal tooth decay  periodontal disease  bone loss  infections  hidden dental structures  abscesses or cysts  developmental abnormalities  some types of tumors  and other issues that might not be detected during a visual examination or upon probing with a handheld instrument 
due to the chemical development process required for film  however  this process is time consuming  inefficient  and costly for dental offices  and not environmentally friendly 
mistakes in the development process can require retakes which expose patients to additional radiation 
film x rays also restrict the abilities of doctors to enhance or further manipulate images for easier and more accurate analysis and treatment planning 
furthermore  one of the most critical limitations of film is that it is restricted to two dimensional images  which can potentially lead to misdiagnosis 
alternative dental instruments alternative technologies have been developed over the years to address the problems associated with traditional methods used in dentistry 
most alternatives have addressed either hard or soft tissue applications but not both 
the predominant alternative technologies are discussed below 
electrosurge systems 
electrosurge systems use an electrical current to heat a shaped tip that simultaneously cuts and cauterizes soft tissue  resulting in less bleeding than occurs with scalpels 
however  electrosurge is generally less precise than lasers and can damage surrounding tissue 
electrosurge is also not suitable for hard tissue procedures and  due to the depth of penetration  generally requires anesthesia and a lengthy healing process 
electrosurge generally cannot be used in areas near metal fillings and dental implants 
finally  electrosurge generally cannot treat patients with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators 
traditional laser systems 
more recently  lasers have gained acceptance for use in general and cosmetic dentistry 
most lasers used in dentistry have been adapted from other medical applications  such as dermatology  and are not designed to perform a wide range of common dental procedures 
most dental lasers use thermal energy to cut tissue and are used primarily for soft tissue procedures 
our solution due to the limitations associated with traditional and alternative dental instruments  we believe there is a large market opportunity for all tissue dental laser systems that provide superior clinical results and help reduce the trauma  pain  and discomfort associated with dental procedures 
we also believe there is a large market opportunity for digital radiography systems that improve practice efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis  leading to superior treatment planning  increased practice revenue  and healthier outcomes for patients 
our waterlase systems precisely cut hard tissue and soft tissue with minimal or no damage to surrounding tissue and dental structure 
our diode systems are designed to complement the waterlase systems  and are used in soft tissue procedures  pain therapy  hygiene  and cosmetic applications  including teeth whitening 
the diode systems  together with our waterlase systems  offer practitioners a broad product line with a range of features and price points 

table of contents the biolase davinci imaging and cefla newtom products are state of the art digital radiography systems that provide both two and three dimensional x ray images as well as intraoral color images that allow doctors to visualize and manipulate significantly more information than previously available with film  without the time delay of film development or cost associated with chemicals and the film itself 
these imaging systems have been designed to produce the highest quality images while exposing patients to the least amount of radiation necessary 
the trios intra oral cad cam scanning product offers diversity in our imaging product line with spray free  high speed  d impression capture as well as touch screen and online lab communication capabilities 
a small percentage of dental professionals worldwide currently use lasers 
our laser systems are more expensive than traditional dental tools  however  we believe that the significant clinical advantages of our systems  patient benefits  the potential return on investment that our systems offer practitioners  and the options available to finance the purchase of our systems will enable us to continue to penetrate the global dental market 
laser technologies with similar patient benefits have become standard of care in ophthalmology  dermatology  and other medical specialties 
when combined with better information digital imaging  dental lasers will give the doctor the best treatment options to perform more procedures in a minimally invasive manner 
this combination of lasers and digital imaging systems makes us the only company to offer high technology solutions for the diagnosis  treatment planning  and delivery of treatment  in the most minimally invasive manner possible the biolase total technology solution 
we believe the demand for our systems will continue to expand as we increase awareness of the benefits to patients and dental professionals 
benefits to dental professionals expanded range of procedures and revenue opportunities 
our laser systems often allow general dentists to perform surgical and cosmetic procedures that they are unable or unwilling to perform with conventional methods  and which would typically be referred to a specialist 
our systems allow dentists to perform these procedures easily and efficiently  increasing their range of skills  professional satisfaction  and revenues 
additional procedures through increased information and efficiency 
our digital imaging systems allow dentists to diagnose and discover cases that they might not be able to detect with film images and or two dimensional images  thereby giving them the ability to offer more treatment options for patients 
our laser systems can shorten and reduce the number of patient visits  providing dental professionals with the ability to service more patients 
for hard tissue procedures  our waterlase systems can reduce the need for anesthesia  which enables the dental practitioner to perform multiple procedures in one visit 
for soft tissue procedures  the waterlase and diode systems allow tissue to be cut more precisely and with minimal bleeding when compared to traditional tools such as scalpels and electrosurge systems 
we have fda clearance for treatment protocols including deep pocket therapy with new attachment and subgingival calculus removal using the waterlase system and the patented radial firing perio tip 
this is a non surgical alternative treatment for moderate to advanced gum disease  the leading cause for tooth loss for adults over age and a condition impacting more than half of americans over age in addition  the epic and ilase systems can be used to quickly perform teeth whitening with our proprietary whitening gel and to provide temporary pain relief from myofascial disorders 
increased loyalty and expanded patient base 
we believe the improved patient comfort and convenience offered by our laser systems and the reduction in chair time and radiation exposure of our digital imaging systems will help improve patient retention  attract new patients  increase revenue per patient  increase demand for elective procedures  increase acceptance of treatment plans  and increase word of mouth referrals 
fewer post operative complications 
by providing more complete and accurate information  our digital imaging systems make it possible for the doctor to determine the optimal diagnosis and treatment plan 

table of contents our laser systems can then be used to reduce trauma  swelling  and general discomfort of the patient  resulting in fewer post operative complications that require follow up treatment 
in addition  our laser systems effectively reduce the risk of cross contamination that can occur with traditional dental tools 
these factors make it possible for practitioners to devote time to new cases  rather than treating complications from prior procedures 
benefits to patients comfort 
the waterlase system is able to perform various types of dental procedures without causing the heat  vibration  microfractures  trauma  or pressure associated with traditional dental methods  without cross contamination 
further  in many cases procedures can be performed without the need for local anesthesia 
convenience 
our waterlase system does not require anesthesia in many cases  which allows dental practitioners to perform procedures in multiple quadrants of the mouth during a single office visit 
digital images are available almost immediately  so patients will not have to spend extra time in the dental chair waiting for film to be developed and doctors are more efficient 
combined with the diode lasers  these systems offer a variety of solutions for patients 
reduced trauma 
the waterlase system avoids the thermal heat transfer  vibration  and grinding action associated with high speed dental drills 
as a result  our systems can result in less trauma  swelling  bleeding  and general discomfort to the patient 
broader range of available procedures 
due to the improved comfort and convenience of our waterlase system  we believe patients are more likely to consider cosmetic and other elective procedures that would generally be time consuming and uncomfortable  including osseous crown lengthening  periodontal surgeries  and numerous other procedures 
since digital images are displayed on computer monitors  doctors can make treatment planning a more personal experience with patients 
we believe that this will lead to greater patient case acceptance 
business strategy our objectives are to increase our leadership position in the dental laser market  to establish our laser systems as essential tools in dentistry  and to leverage our existing technology platform into other medical markets where it can provide significant improvements over existing standards of care

waterlase systems 
our all tissuewaterlase dental laser systems currently consist of the waterlase iplus  the waterlase md turbo  and the waterlase mdx and  both introduced in february each of these systems is designed around our patented ysgg laser technology that refers to the unique laser crystal used in the waterlase system  which contains the elements erbium  chromium and yttrium  scandium  gallium and garnet er  cr ysgg 
this unique crystal laser produces energy with specific absorption and tissue interaction characteristics optimized for dental applications 
hydrophotonics refers to the interaction of ysgg lasers with water to produce energy to cut tissue 
it is minimally invasive and can precisely cut hard tissue  such as bone and teeth  and soft tissue  such as gums or skin  without the heat  vibration  or pressure associated with traditional dental treatments 
by eliminating heat  vibration  and pressure  our waterlase systems reduce and  in some instances  eliminate the need for anesthesia and also result in faster healing times versus traditional methods of treatment 
the waterlase systems incorporate an ergonomic handpiece and an extensive control panel located on the front of the system with precise preset functionality to control the mix of laser energy  air  and water  as well as the pulse rate 
each system also has been designed to be easily moved from operatory to operatory within a practice office 
the original waterlase md released in features white light emitting diode led handpiece illumination  a full color touch screen improving user friendliness with a built in user help system  a refined water spray that improves cutting  and a windows ce operating system 
in  we introduced a new clinical procedure for endodontic root canal disinfection with radial firing tips 
the waterlase md turbo all tissue dental laser system was introduced in the first quarter of and increased the cutting speed compared to the original waterlase md 
in  we also obtained fda clearance for a new treatment protocol called deep pocket therapy with new attachment using the waterlase md and the patented radial firing perio tip 
this is a non surgical alternative treatment for moderate to advanced gum disease  the leading cause of tooth loss for adults over and a condition impacting more than half of americans over age the procedure assists in new attachment and subgingival calculus removal  and in most cases provides deep pocket treatments in a single visit without the use of a scalpel  stitches  or the conventional cutting of the gums 
the waterlase iplus  introduced in january  is our most advanced and powerful  yet most intuitive  dual wavelength all tissue dental laser system 
it delivers all the benefits of our other waterlases  but with more power  versatility  and ease of use  including and intuitive user interface and a significant increase in cutting speed that is comparable to a high speed drill

the insurance is subject to various standard coverage exclusions  including damage to the product itself  losses from recall of our product  and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us  nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
manufacturing our strategy is to manufacture products in house when it is efficient for us to do so 
we currently manufacture  assemble  and test all of our products at our corporate headquarters facility in irvine  california 
the  square foot facility has approximately  square feet dedicated to manufacturing and warehousing 
the facility is iso certified 
iso certification provides guidelines for our quality management system associated with the design  manufacturing  installation  and servicing of our products 
in addition  our us facility is registered with the fda and is compliant with the fda s quality system regulation 
we use an integrated approach to manufacturing  including the assembly of tips  laser hand pieces  fiber assemblies  laser heads  electro mechanical subassembly  final assembly  and testing 
we obtain components and subassemblies for our products from third party suppliers  the majority of which are located in the united states 
we generally purchase components and subassemblies from a limited group of suppliers through purchase orders 
in general  we rely on these purchase orders and do not have written supply contracts with many of our key suppliers 
three key components used in our waterlase system handpieces  laser crystals  and fiber components are each supplied by separate single source suppliers 
in recent years  we have not experienced material delays from the suppliers of these three key components 
however  in the event that we experience an unexpected interruption from a single source supplier  manufacturing delays  re engineering  significant costs  and sales disruptions could occur  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are currently in the process of identifying 
table of contents and qualifying alternate source suppliers for our key components  including but not limited to those noted above 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us 
marketing and sales marketing we currently market our laser systems in the united states and worldwide 
our marketing efforts are focused on increasing brand and specific product awareness among dental practitioners 
we continue to explore methods to increase awareness of the benefits of our products by marketing directly to patients 
dental practitioners 
we currently market our laser systems to dental practitioners through regional  national and international trade publications  educational events  individual meetings  the internet  and seminars 
we also use brochures  direct mailers  press releases  posters  and other promotional materials  as well as print and electronic media news coverage 
in  we introduced the biolase store for online purchase of lasers  consumables  accessories  and service contracts in north america 
in  we founded the wcli to formalize our efforts to educate and train dental practitioners in laser dentistry 
the wcli conducts and sponsors educational programs domestically and internationally for dental practitioners  researchers  and academicians  including one  two  and three day seminars and training sessions involving in depth presentations on the use of lasers in dentistry 
in addition  we have developed relationships with research institutions  dental schools  and laboratories which use our products in training and demonstrations 
we believe these relationships will increase awareness of our products 
in we formalized a year agreement with professor norbert gutknecht and the aachen center for laser dentistry aalz  the acknowledged leader in dental laser education since its founding in we expect the aalz and related world academy for laser education in dentistry network waled will expand the availability of postgraduate advanced wavelength clinical laser education to more than countries while also taking major steps toward standardizing laser dental education for all our owners worldwide 
chiropractors  sports medicine 
we market to chiropractors  physical therapists  and other pain management specialists through trade advertising  seminars  and trade shows 
our marketing activities are primarily executed by our network of independent sales representatives who are managed by our internal sales management team 
patients 
we market the benefits of our laser systems directly to patients through marketing and advertising programs  including the internet  social networks  print and broadcast media  local television news and radio spots  as well as product placements of our laser systems on television programs 
we believe that making patients aware of our laser systems and their benefits will increase demand for our products 
sales we currently sell our products primarily to dentists in general practice through our direct sales force and our distributor network 
the majority of the dentists in the united states and the majority of our end user customers are sole practitioners 
we expect our laser systems to continue to gain acceptance among periodontists  endodontists  oral surgeons  and other dental specialists as they become better aware of the clinical benefits and new treatment options available through the use of our laser systems 
outside of the dental market  we expect that our initial sales of lasers will be to chiropractors  physical therapists  and other pain management specialists  as well as the veterinary market

north american sales 
effective september   we commenced selling our products into the us and canadian markets exclusively through hsic 
as part of this agreement  hsic purchased products from us at negotiated distributor pricing  and invoiced the customer directly at the customer s purchase order price 
on september   we entered into a distribution and supply agreement with hsic  effective august   the d s agreement  which terminated all prior agreements with hsic 
under the d s agreement  we granted hsic certain non exclusive distribution rights in north america and several international markets with respect to our dental laser systems  accessories  and related support and services in certain circumstances 
in addition  we granted hsic exclusivity in selected international markets subject to review of certain performance criteria 
in connection with the d s agreement  hsic placed two irrevocable purchase orders totaling million for our products 
the first purchase order  totaling million  was for the purchase of ilase systems and was fully satisfied during the first quarter of the second purchase order  totaling million  was for the purchase of a combination of laser systems and was fully satisfied during the third quarter of the d s agreement granted hsic a security interest in our inventory and assets  including our intellectual property 

table of contents on april   we completed a transaction with hsic the termination agreement whereby we purchased hsic s inventory of waterlase md turbo laser systems for approximately million and hsic released its liens on our assets  including our inventory and intellectual property 
as part of the termination agreement  we reacquired md turbo laser systems at a cost well below market 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  the entire purchase price was paid by offsetting certain accounts receivable currently due from hsic from sales made in the normal course of business 
none of the funds used to offset the purchase price were related to the original sales of the md turbo laser systems that were purchased 
as a result of the transaction  we are no longer required to fulfill certain future service obligations and  accordingly  derecognized approximately  of accounts receivable due from hsic related to support services previously provided and approximately  of accrued warranties during the quarter ended march  during the quarter ended june   the company reversed accrued sales and marketing service liabilities of approximately  because the liability was extinguished with the closing of the termination agreement 
during the year ended december   the company sold all laser systems purchased under this arrangement at margins consistent with our comparable laser products 
international sales 
through  we sold products in germany  spain  australia  and new zealand through direct sales forces from our sales and service locations in those respective countries 
in the first quarter of  we transitioned sales in these countries from direct sales to distribution through hsic and a network of other independent distributors 
our distributors purchase laser systems and disposables from us at wholesale dealer prices and resell them to dentists in their sales territories 
all sales to distributors are final and we can terminate our arrangements with dealers and distributors for cause or non performance 
in some select territories we have granted certain distributors the right to be our exclusive distributor in that territory 
these distributors are generally required to satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements to maintain their exclusivity 
in  we began selling our products directly to end users in germany and other countries where we have non exclusive distribution arrangements 
in  we began selling our products directly to end users in india and neighboring countries 
customer concentration 
from through  we were substantially dependent on our distributor  hsic  for purchases of our products 
for the years ended december    and  sales to hsic worldwide accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenue 
hsic no longer distributes our products on an exclusive basis 
instead we sell our products through our direct sales force and non exclusive distributor relationships 
however  our relationship with hsic remains significant and they are our largest non exclusive distributor in the us and certain other countries 
customer service 
we provide maintenance and support services through our support hotline  field and factory service technicians  and our network of factory trained third party service technicians 
we currently provide maintenance and support services in the united states and canada through our employee service technicians 
we maintain a network of service technicians who provide maintenance and support services in all other countries where we do business 
our international distributors are responsible for providing maintenance and support services for products sold by them 
we provide parts to distributors at no additional charge for products covered under warranty 
financing options 
many dentists finance their purchases through third party leasing companies  banks  or lessors 
in the united states and canada  third party customers enter into a lease with a lessor who purchases the product from us or one of our distributors 
we are not party to these leases  so if the customer agrees to pay the lessor in installments  we do not bear the credit risk that the dentist might not make payments 
the leasing companies and banks do not have recourse to us for a customer s failure to make payments  nor do we have any obligation to take back the product at the end of the lease 
seasonality 
historically  we have experienced fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter due to seasonality 
revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental professionals 
in addition  revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year 

table of contents engineering and product development engineering and product development activities are essential to maintaining and enhancing our business 
we believe our engineering and product development team has demonstrated its ability to develop innovative products that meet evolving market needs 
our research and product development group consists of approximately individuals with medical device and laser development experience  including two ph 
ds 
during the years ended december    and  our engineering and product development expenses totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our current engineering and product development activities are focused on improving our existing products and technology and extending our product range in order to provide dental practitioners and patients with less painful and clinically superior laser systems 
some examples of the improvements we are pursuing for our dental lasers include faster cutting speed  ease of use  less need for anesthesia injections  interconnectivity  and an expanded portfolio of consumable products for use with our laser systems 
we also devote engineering and development resources toward markets outside of dentistry in which we might exploit our technology platform and capabilities 
we believe our laser technology and developments capabilities could be applicable in several other medical markets  including ophthalmology  orthopedics  podiatry  pain management  aesthetics dermatology  veterinary  and consumer products 
in may  we entered into a license agreement the p g agreement with procter gamble company p g  which replaced an existing license agreement between us and p g the p g agreement 
pursuant to the p g agreement  we agreed to continue granting p g an exclusive license to certain of our patents to enable p g to develop products aimed at the consumer market and p g agreed to pay royalties based on sales of products developed with such intellectual property 
the prepaid royalty payments previously paid by p g were applied to the new exclusive license period from january  through december  at this time  we had deferred royalty revenue totaling million from the p g agreement 
the p g agreement permitted us to recognize million in royalty revenue for the year ended december  related to the and exclusivity period 
as of december    remained in long term deferred revenue 
on june   we entered into an amendment to the p g agreement the p g amendment which extended the effective period for the p g agreement from december  through june   and resulted in us recognizing the previously deferred  of revenue as royalty revenue during the quarter ended june  the p g amendment also provided that effective january   p g s exclusive license to our patents converted to a non exclusive license unless p g paid us a license payment in the amount of  by the end of the third quarter of  and at the end of each quarter thereafter  throughout the term of the p g agreement 
as a result of p g not making any payments to us in the third or fourth quarters of the year ended december   their license converted to a non exclusive license 
we are currently engaged in an active collaboration with p g to commercialize a consumer product utilizing our patents 
intellectual property and proprietary rights we believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace  we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property 
we have developed a patent portfolio internally  and to a lesser extent through acquisitions and licensing  that covers many aspects of our product offerings 
as of december   we had approximately issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states  europe and other countries around the world 
while we hold a variety of patents that cover a broad range of technologies and methods  the majority of these patents provide market protection for our core technologies incorporated in our laser systems and related accessories 
existing patents related to our core technology  which are at various stages of being incorporated into our products  are scheduled to expire as follows five in  four in  in  in  and six in 
table of contents with the majority having expiration dates ranging from to with approximately patent applications pending  we expect the number of new grants to exceed the number of patents expiring 
we do not expect the expiration of the expired or soon to expire patents to have a material adverse effect on our business 
there are risks related to our intellectual property rights 
for further details on these risks  see item a risk factors 
competition we compete with a number of companies that market traditional dental products  such as dental drills  as well as other companies that market laser technologies in dental and other medical markets 
in the domestic hard tissue dental market  we believe our waterlase systems primarily compete with laser systems manufactured by lares dental research  the us distributor of fotona us in the international market  our waterlase systems compete primarily with products manufactured by several companies  including fotona dd  kavo dental gmbh  lambda spa  j morita manufacturing corp  syneron medical ltd  and deka laser technologies  inc our waterlase systems also compete with non laser based systems  including traditional high and low speed dental drills and air abrasion systems that are used for dental procedures 
our diode laser systems  including the epic  ezlase and ilase  compete with other semiconductor diode lasers manufactured by ivoclar vivadent  inc  sirona dental systems  inc  kavo dental gmbh  amd lasers  llc  which was acquired by dentsply  inc in july  arc  giga  zila and denmat  as well as with scalpels  scissors and a variety of other cutting tools that have been traditionally used to perform soft tissue procedures 
we also expect other domestic and foreign laser manufacturers to enter this market in the future 
our new epic and ilase lasers were specifically designed to compete in this growing market with key differentiating features and performance 
unlike the epic and ezlase  none of the lasers in this category have fda clearance for use in both pain management therapy and teeth whitening  in addition to a full range of soft tissue indications 
our epic and ezlase system competes with other in office whitening products and high intensity lights used by dentists  as well as teeth whitening strips and other over the counter products 
traditional and commonly used cutting tools are less expensive for performing dental procedures 
for example  a high speed handpiece or an electrosurge device  not including the cost of replacement disposables  can be purchased for less than  each 
in addition  our systems are not designed to perform certain functions that high speed drills can perform  such as cutting metal fillings and certain polishing and grinding functions 
our systems are not intended to replace all of the applications of the high speed drill and a drill may be required for certain procedures 
we believe that the principal competitive factors for companies that market laser technologies in the dental and other medical markets include acceptance by leading dental practitioners  product performance  product pricing  intellectual property protection  customer education and support  timing of new product research  and development of successful national and international distribution channels 
some of the manufacturers that develop competing laser systems have significantly greater financial  marketing  and or technical resources than we do 
in addition  some competitors have developed  and others may attempt to develop  products with applications similar to those performed by our laser systems 

table of contents because of the large size of the potential market for our products  we anticipate that new or existing competitors may develop competing products  procedures  or clinical solutions which could prove to be more effective  safer  or less costly than procedures using our laser systems 
the introduction of new products  procedures  or clinical solutions by competitors may result in price reductions  reduced margins  loss of market share  or may render our products obsolete 
government regulation fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive either k clearance  by filing a k pre market notification  or pma approval  by filing a premarket approval application pma from the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can take longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly  lengthy  and uncertain 
it generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
we cannot be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market 
the fda decides whether a device must undergo either the k clearance or pma approval process based upon statutory criteria 
these criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed 
devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class i or ii  which generally requires the manufacturer to submit a pre market notification requesting k clearance  unless an exemption applies 
class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda s general regulatory controls general controls for medical devices  which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda s quality system regulation qsr facility registration and product listing  reporting of adverse medical events  and appropriate  truthful and non misleading labeling  advertising  and promotional materials 
some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the k premarket notification process 
class ii devices are subject to the fda s general controls  and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device 
premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the k premarket notification procedure 
all of our current regulated devices are class ii devices and all have qualified for k clearance 
class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting  or implantable devices  or deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device 
the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above 
these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below 
premarket approval applications  and supplemental premarket approval applications  are subject to significantly higher user fees under medical device user fee and modernization act of  or mdufma  than are k premarket notifications  and generally take much longer for the fda to review 
to obtain k clearance  a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to a legally marketed predicate device that is either in class i  class ii  or is a class iii device that was in commercial distribution before may   for which the fda has not yet called for submission of a pma application 
pursuant to the mdufma and the mdufma ii provisions of the food and drug amendments act of  unless a specific exemption applies  k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its 
table of contents safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or could require a pma approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any decision 
if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer s decision not to seek a new k clearance  the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek k clearance or pma approval 
the fda also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained 
we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements to our laser systems that we believe will not require new k clearances 
we cannot assure you that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek additional k clearances or even pma approval for these or future device modifications 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or pma approval for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance or pma approval 
class iii devices are required to undergo the pma approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda s satisfaction 
a pma application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding  among other things  device design  manufacturing and labeling 
also during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the qsr 
a new pma or a pma supplement is required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device  including  for example  certain types of modifications to the device s indications for use  manufacturing process  manufacturing facility  labeling and design 
pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original pma application  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application  and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
none of our products are currently approved under a pma 
a clinical trial may be required in support of a k submission and generally is required for a pma application 
these trials generally require an investigational device exemption ide application approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients  unless the product is deemed a non significant risk device eligible for certain exemptions from the ide requirements 
the ide application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results 
clinical trials may begin if the ide application is approved by the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites 
even if a trial is completed  the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain fda clearance to market the product in the us in the future  we may be required to make additional k submissions to the fda to address new claims  uses  or products 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not deem one or more of our future products  or those of our oem partners  to be a class iii device subject to the more burdensome pma approval process 
the fda also may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization 
indeed  the fda may refuse our requests for k clearance or pma of new products  new intended uses or modifications to existing products 
pervasive and continuing fda regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply 
those regulatory requirements include product listing and establishment registration  which helps facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory action  qsr  which requires manufacturers  including third party manufacturers  to follow stringent design control  testing  change control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process  
table of contents labeling control and advertising regulations which include fda prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared  unapproved  or off label uses or indications  clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices  approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our future approved devices  medical device reporting mdr  regulations  which require that manufacturers comply with fda requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur  post approval restrictions or conditions  including post approval study commitments  post market surveillance requirements  which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device  the fda s recall authority  whereby it can ask  or under certain conditions order  device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws or regulations or other conditions under which the product was approved  regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls  and notices of corrections or removals 
we will need to invest significant time and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with fda qsr and other post market regulatory requirements 
we have registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and we have obtained a manufacturing license from the california department of health services 
as a manufacturer  we are subject to announced and unannounced facility inspections by the fda and the california department of health services to determine our compliance with various regulations 
our subcontractors manufacturing facilities are also subject to inspection 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines and civil penalties  unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions  delays in clearing or approving  or refusal to clear or approve  our products  withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third party suppliers by the fda or other regulatory bodies  product recall or seizure  interruption of production  operating restrictions  injunctions  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement  or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 
our failure  or the failure of our subcontractors  to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents advertising and promotion of medical devices  in addition to being regulated by the fda  are also regulated by the federal trade commission ftc and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities 
recently  promotional activities for fda regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes 
in addition  under the federal lanham act and similar state laws  competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a notice of violation  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine  or criminal penalties 
in that event  our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired 
we are also subject to regulation under the radiation control for safety and health act of the safety act  which is administered by the fda 
the safety act regulates the energy emissions of light and sound and electronic waves from electronic products 
regulations implementing the safety act require a laser manufacturer to file new product and annual reports  to maintain quality control  product testing  and sales records  to distribute product operation manuals  to incorporate certain design and operating features in lasers sold to end users  and to certify and label each laser sold to end users as one of four classes of lasers based on the level of radiation emitted from the laser 
in addition  various warning labels must be affixed to the product and certain protective features must be installed  depending upon the class of product 
foreign regulation many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the fda 
international sales are subject to foreign government regulation  the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance and the requirements may differ 
companies are now required to obtain the ce mark prior to sale of medical devices within the european union 
during this process  the sponsor must demonstrate compliance with the international organization for standardization s manufacturing and quality requirements 
we have received ce marking for our waterlase and diode laser systems 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary foreign government approvals or successfully comply with foreign regulations 
our failure to do so could hurt our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
other us regulation we and subcontractors also must comply with numerous federal  state and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and hazardous substance disposal 
we cannot be sure that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future or that these laws or regulations will not hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental our manufacturing processes involve the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  including alcohol  adhesives and cleaning materials 
as such  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the use  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes 
future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes  thereby increasing our manufacturing costs 
we believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws  however  the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated 

table of contents health care fraud and abuse in the us  there are federal and state anti kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks  bribes  or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health related business 
for example  the federal health care programs anti kickback law usc a b b prohibits anyone from  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving any bribe  kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for  or the purchase order  or recommendation of  health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program  including medicare and medicaid 
recognizing that the federal anti kickback law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements  congress and the office of inspector general within the department of health and human services oig has created statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors 
exceptions and safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business  including  among other things  payments to bona fide employees  certain discount and rebate arrangements  and certain payment arrangements 
although an arrangement that fits into one or more of these exceptions or safe harbors is immune from prosecution  arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law and the oig or other government enforcement authorities will examine the practice to determine whether it involves the sorts of abuses that the statute was designed to combat 
violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties  including imprisonment  monetary fines and assessments  and exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs 
exclusion of a manufacturer  like us  would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products 
in addition to the federal anti kickback law  many states have their own laws that parallel and implicate anti kickback restrictions analogous to the federal anti kickback law  but may apply regardless of whether any federal health care program business is involved 
federal and state anti kickback laws may affect our sales  marketing and promotional activities  educational programs  pricing and discount practices and policies  and relationships with dental and medical providers by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals  alternate care market providers  physicians  dentists and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products 
federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment to third party payers that are false or fraudulent 
for example  the federal civil false claims act usc et seq 
imposes liability on any person or entity who  among other things  knowingly and willfully presents  or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program  including medicaid and medicare 
some suits filed under the false claims act  known as qui tam actions  can be brought by a whistleblower  or relater on behalf of the government and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 
manufacturers  like us  can be held liable under false claims laws  even if they do not submit claims to the government  where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by  among other things  providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims  or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims 
a number of states also have false claims laws  and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under medicaid and or commercial insurance 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  and imprisonment 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa created two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements related to health care matters 
the health care fraud statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payers 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs 
the false statements statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and imprisonment 
the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws in non us jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 

table of contents due to the breadth of some of these laws  it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 
evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians 
our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are broad and open to interpretation 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  which could hurt our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
privacy and security of health information numerous federal  state  and international laws and regulations govern the collection  use  and disclosure of patient identifiable health information  including hipaa 
hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most healthcare including dental facilities that purchase and use our products 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  and requires covered entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored electronically 
we are not a covered entity but due to activities that we perform for or on behalf of covered entities  we are sometimes deemed to be a business associate of covered entities 
in certain circumstances  the hipaa rules require covered entities to contractually bind us  as a business associate  to protect the privacy and security of health information we may encounter during activities like training customers on the use of our products or investigating product performance 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech enacted in february  made significant amendments to the hipaa privacy and security rules 
most provisions of hitech were effective february   however  the new federal health data breach notice provision which requires business associates to notify covered entities of any breach of unsecured health information went into effect in september prior to february   our business was not directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security rules 
as a business associate  our privacy and security related obligations were solely contractual in nature and governed by the terms of each business associate agreement 
hitech fundamentally changed a business associate s obligations by imposing a number of hipaa privacy rule requirements and a majority of hipaa security rule provisions directly on business associates and making business associates directly subject to hipaa civil and criminal enforcement and the associated penalties for violation of the privacy and security rule requirements 
hitech increased civil penalty amounts for violations of hipaa by either covered entities or business associates and requires the us department of health and human services to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance 
in addition  hitech authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions in response to violations of hipaa privacy and security rules that threaten the privacy of state residents 
due to the very recent enactment of hitech and expected implementing regulations  we are unable to predict what the extent of the impact on our business will be  but these new hitech requirements may require us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations 
the hipaa standards also apply to the use and disclosure of health information for research  and require the covered entity performing the research to obtain the written authorization of the research subject or an appropriate waiver before providing that subject s health information to sponsors like us for purposes related to the research 
these covered entities also typically impose contractual limitations on our use and disclosure of the health information they disclose to us 
we may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with the privacy and security requirements that will be imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of patient information  including state medical privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws 
these various laws in many cases are not preempted by the hipaa rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government 
table of contents agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense  adverse publicity  and liability 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use  and transmission of personal or patient information and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa  congressional action or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle health care related data  and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant 
if we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions 
third party reimbursement dentists and other healthcare providers that purchase our products generally rely on third party payers  including the medicare and medicaid programs and private payers  such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans  to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products and the procedures in which they are used 
as a result  demand for our products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payers 
no uniform coverage or reimbursement policy for medical technology exists among all third party payers  and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer 
the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act  enacted in march  is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the us the impact of this expansion of coverage on the sales of our products is currently unknown 
the affordable care act includes medicare reimbursement policy  payment and health care delivery system  and coverage reforms  including development  implementation  and revision to prospective payment systems  any of which may adversely impact third party reimbursements received by our end user customers 
centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  the federal agency responsible for administering the medicare program  along with its contractors  establish coverage and reimbursement policies for the medicare program 
in addition  private payers  whom often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of medicare  and employer sponsored health care plans  are subject to rules and penalties under the affordable care act which may also adversely impact third party reimbursements received by our end user customers 
we cannot assure you that government or private third party payers will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate and we continue to assess the impact of the affordable care act on our business 
in general  we expect medicare will continue to cover a medical product or procedure when the product or procedure is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury  or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part 
even if the medical product or procedure is considered medically necessary and coverage is available  medicare may place restrictions on the circumstances where it provides coverage 
medicare payments also are frequently made under a prospective payment system based on the ambulatory payment classifications apcs  under which individual items and procedures are categorized 
providers of outpatient services typically receive reimbursement the applicable apc payment rate for a procedure regardless of the actual cost for such treatment 
some outpatient services for which our products may be used do not receive separate reimbursement 
rather  their reimbursement is deemed packaged into the apc for an associated procedure  and the payment for that apc does not vary depending on whether the packaged procedure is performed 
some procedures also are paid through composite apcs  which are apcs that establish a payment rate that applies when a specific combination of services is provided 
we believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable  with the exception of cosmetic applications  such as teeth whitening 
because payments through the prospective payment system are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a provider s actual costs in furnishing care  providers have incentives to lower their operating costs by 
table of contents utilizing products that will decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs 
we cannot be certain that dental and medical service providers will purchase our products  despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use 
if providers cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  or the procedures in which they are used  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could suffer

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks come to fruition  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our revenue continued global economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets may continue to adversely affect our liquidity  operating results  and financial condition 
our business is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions as a seller of capital equipment to end users in dental professional practices 
financial markets inside the united states and internationally have experienced extreme disruption in recent times  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  and declining valuations of investments 
these disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy 
a continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may reduce demand for our products and services  increase order cancellations and result in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies  increase the difficulty of collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories  increase price competition in our served markets  and result in supply interruptions  which could disrupt our ability to produce our products 
we have experienced net losses for each of the past three years and we may experience additional losses and have difficulty achieving profitability in the future 
we have an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  we recorded net losses of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in order to achieve profitability  we must control our costs and increase net revenue through new sales 
failure to increase our net revenue and decrease our costs could cause our stock price to decline 
our business is capital intensive and the failure to obtain capital could require that we curtail capital expenditures 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in the development of our products  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the expansion of our operating and management 
table of contents infrastructure as we increase sales domestically and internationally 
if cash generated from our operations is insufficient to fund such growth  we may be required to raise additional funds through further debt or equity financings  which may dilute the percentage ownership of existing holders of common stock and which may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock thereby resulting in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  we may be subject to debt covenants which could place limitations on our operations 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all  or we may use capital more rapidly than anticipated 
if we cannot raise the required capital when needed  we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose revenue and market share 
the following factors  among others  could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all our results of operations  general economic conditions and conditions in the dental or medical device industries  the perception of our business in the capital markets  our ratio of debt to equity  our financial condition  our business prospects  and interest rates 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future  we may have to curtail our capital expenditures 
any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net revenue  reduced quality of our products  increased manufacturing costs for our products  harm to our reputation  reduced manufacturing efficiencies or other harm to our business 
our distributors may cancel  reduce or delay orders of our products  any of which could reduce our revenue 
we rely on exclusive and non exclusive independent distributors for a declining portion of our sales in north america and a majority of our sales in countries outside of the united states and canada 
for the fiscal years ended december    and revenue from distributors accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenue  respectively 
our ability to maintain or increase our revenue will depend in large part on our success in developing and maintaining relationships with our current distributors and developing relationships with new distributors 
our distributors have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they apply to the sale of our products 
our distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations and  regardless of the resources they commit  they may not be successful 
from time to time  we may face competition or pricing pressure from one or more of our non exclusive distributors in certain geographic areas where those distributors are selling inventory to the same customer base as us 
additionally  most of our distributor agreements can be terminated with limited notice  and we may not be able to replace any terminating distributor in a timely manner or on terms agreeable to us  if at all 
if we are not able to maintain our distribution network  if our distribution network is not successful in marketing and selling our products  or if we experience a significant reduction in  cancellation or change in the size and timing of orders from our distributors  our revenues could decline significantly 
dentists and patients have been hesitant in adopting laser technologies and our inability to overcome this hesitancy could limit the market acceptance of our products and market share 
our dental laser systems represent relatively new technologies in the dental market 
currently  only a small percentage of dentists use lasers to perform dental procedures 
our future success will depend on our ability to 
table of contents increase demand for our products by demonstrating the potential performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems to a broad spectrum of dentists and patients 
historically  we have experienced long sales cycles because dentists have been  and may continue to be  slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis 
as a result  we generally are required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to educate dentists about the benefits of our products in comparison to competing products and technologies before completing a sale  if any 
factors that may inhibit adoption of laser technologies by dentists include cost and concerns about the safety  efficacy and reliability of lasers 
in order to invest in a waterlase system  a dentist generally needs to invest time to understand the technology  consider how patients may respond to the new technology  assess the financial impact the investment may have on the dentist s practice and become comfortable performing procedures with our products 
absent an immediate competitive motivation  a dentist may not feel compelled to invest the time required to learn about the potential benefits of using a laser system 
dentists may not accept or adopt our products until they see additional clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficiency of our products or recommendations supporting our laser systems by influential dental practitioners 
in addition  economic pressure  caused  for example  by an economic slowdown  changes in healthcare reimbursement or by competitive factors in a specific market  may make dentists reluctant to purchase substantial capital equipment or invest in new technologies 
patient acceptance will depend on the recommendations of dentists and specialists  as well as other factors  including without limitation  the relative effectiveness  safety  reliability and comfort of our systems as compared to other instruments and methods for performing dental procedures 
the failure of dental lasers to achieve broad market acceptance would limit sales of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any failure in our efforts to train dental practitioners could reduce the market acceptance of waterlase dentistry and reduce our revenues 
there is a learning process involved for dental practitioners to become proficient users of our laser systems 
it is critical to the success of our sales efforts to adequately train a sufficient number of dental practitioners 
following completion of training  we rely on the trained dental practitioners to advocate the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace 
convincing dental practitioners to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts 
if dental practitioners are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products  or may be less likely to appreciate our laser systems 
this may also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury  negative publicity or lawsuits against us  any of which could negatively affect our reputation and sales of our laser systems 
if future data proves to be inconsistent with our clinical results or if competitors products present more favorable results our revenues may decline 
if new studies or comparative studies generate results that are not as favorable as our clinical results  our revenues may decline 
additionally  if future studies indicate that our competitors products are more effective or safer than ours  our revenues may decline 
furthermore  physicians may choose not to purchase our laser systems until they receive additional published long term clinical evidence and recommendations from prominent physicians that indicate our laser systems are effective for dental applications 
we face competition from other companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
if we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with products or alternative technologies developed by others  we could lose revenue opportunities and customers and our ability to grow our business would be impaired 
a number of competitors have substantially greater capital resources  larger customer bases  larger technical  sales and marketing forces and have established stronger reputations with target customers than ours 

table of contents we compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies that market traditional dental products  such as dental drills  as well as companies that market laser technologies in the dental and medical markets 
the marketplace is highly fragmented and very competitive 
we expect that the rapid technological changes occurring in the healthcare industry may lead to the entry of new competitors  particularly if dental and medical lasers gain increasing market acceptance 
if we do not compete successfully  our revenue and market share may decline 
our long term success depends upon our ability to i distinguish our products through improving our product performance and pricing  protecting our intellectual property  continuously improving our customer support  accurately timing the introduction of new products  and developing sustainable distribution channels worldwide  and ii develop and successful commercialize new products  new or improved technologies  and additional applications for our existing dental and medical lasers 
if our customers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for their use of our products  they may be less inclined to purchase our products 
our products are generally purchased by dental or medical professionals who have various billing practices and patient mixes 
such practices range from primarily private pay to those who rely heavily on third party payors  such as private insurance or government programs 
in the united states  third party payors review and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical services 
in many foreign countries  the prices for dental services are predetermined through government regulation 
payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that the procedure was not medically necessary or that the device used in the procedure was investigational 
we believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable  with the exception of cosmetic applications  such as teeth whitening 
for the portion of dentists who rely heavily on third party reimbursement  the inability to obtain reimbursement for services using our products could deter them from purchasing or using our products 
we cannot predict the effect of future healthcare reforms or changes in financing for health and dental plans 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on the ability of a dental or medical professional to generate a return on investment using our current or future products 
such changes could act as disincentives for capital investments by dental and medical professionals and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
section of the internal revenue code irc of generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
in  we completed an analysis to determine the applicability of the annual limitations imposed by irc section caused by previous changes in our stock ownership and determined that such limitations should not be significant 
based on our analysis  we believe that  as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards were available to us for federal income tax purposes 
a detailed analysis will be required at the time we begin utilization of any net operating losses to determine if there is an irc section limitation 
in addition  any ownership changes qualifying under irc section including changes resulting from or affected by our public offering or our stock repurchase plan may adversely affect our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
if we lose our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards  any income we generate will be subject to tax earlier than it would be if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  resulting in lower profits 
risks related to our intellectual property if the patents that we own or license  or our other intellectual property rights  do not adequately protect our technologies  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property 
table of contents of others 
we rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
we currently possess a number of issued patents and patent applications with respect to our products and technology  however  we cannot assure that any additional patents will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will be effective in helping us address our competition or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
it is also possible that our competitors may independently develop similar or more desirable products  duplicate our products or design products that circumvent our patents 
additionally  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition  there are numerous proposed changes to the patent laws and rules of the us patent and trademark office which  if enacted  may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights 
for example  congress is considering several significant changes to the us patent laws  including among other things changing from a first to invent to a first inventory to file system  limiting the time for which a patentee may file a patent suit  requiring the apportionment of patent damages  and creating a post grant opposition process to challenge patents after they have issued 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately  our competitive position and financial condition may be adversely affected 
if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products 
we face substantial uncertainty regarding the impact that other parties intellectual property positions will have on the markets for dental and other medical lasers 
the medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and expect to continue to receive  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
some of these claims may lead to litigation 
we may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  may be time consuming and distracting to management  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of proprietary rights 
a successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property 
additionally  we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology  and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms  or at all 
any of the foregoing adverse events could seriously affect our business 
risks related to our regulatory environment changes in government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could harm our business 
our products are subject to extensive government regulation  both in the united states and in other countries 
to clinically test  manufacture and market products for human use  we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the fda and comparable state and foreign agencies 
regulations adopted by the fda are wide ranging and govern  among other things  product design  development  manufacture and control testing  labeling control  storage  advertising and sales 
generally  products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed for human applications 
the clearance process is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the fda can result in an enforcement action which may include a variety of sanctions  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution 
the failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes  or significant delays in obtaining such approvals  could prevent us from developing  manufacturing and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive 
should we develop new products and applications or make any significant modifications to our existing products or labeling  we will need to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals to market such products 

table of contents any modification that could significantly affect a product s safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a change in its intended use  will require a new fda k clearance  or could require a pma application 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer s determination  the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or pma is obtained 
if k clearance is denied and a pre market approval application is required  we could be required to submit substantially more data  may be required to conduct human clinical testing and would very likely be subject to a significantly longer review period 
products sold in international markets are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each respective country or region 
the regulations of the european union require that a device have a ce mark  indicating conformance with european union laws and regulations before it can be sold in that market 
the regulatory international review process varies from country to country 
we rely on our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to comply with the regulatory laws of such countries 
failure to comply with the laws of such countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations and  at the very least  could prevent us from continuing to sell products in such countries 
in addition  unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us  which could increase our operating expenses and harm our financial condition 
changes in the health care industry in the us and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business 
significantly  president obama signed health care reform legislation into law that will require most individuals to have health insurance  establish new regulations on health plans  and create insurance pooling mechanisms and other expanded public health care measures 
in general  an expansion in government s role in the us health care industry may lower reimbursements for our products or the procedures for which our products are used  reduce demand for innovative products  reduce volumes for dental and medical procedures and adversely affect our business and results of operations  possibly materially 
in addition  as a result of the focus on health care reform  there is risk that congress may implement changes in laws and regulations governing health care service providers  including measures to control costs  or reductions in reimbursement levels 
we may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state health care laws  including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws  and could face penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such regulations  we could face substantial penalties 
we are directly or indirectly  through our customers  subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business 
the laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include  but are not limited to  the following the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  which regulates the design  testing  manufacture  labeling  marketing  distribution and sale of prescription drugs and medical devices  state food and drug laws  the federal anti kickback law  which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  offering  receiving or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  in cash or in kind  to induce either  the referral of an individual  or furnishing or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs  medicare laws and regulations that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment  including the amount of such payment  and laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement under medicare and medicaid  the federal physician self referral prohibition  commonly known as the stark law  which  in the absence of a statutory or regulatory exception  prohibits the referral of medicare patients by a physician to an 
table of contents entity for the provision of designated healthcare services  if the physician or a member of the physician s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship  including an ownership interest in  or a compensation arrangement with  the entity and also prohibits that entity from submitting a bill to a federal payor for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral  federal provisions of hipaa that established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services  federal and state false claims laws that prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment to third party payers that are false or fraudulent  state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non physicians and fee splitting arrangements between physicians and non physicians  as well as state law equivalents to the anti kickback law and the stark law  which may not be limited to government reimbursed items  and the federal trade commission act and similar laws regulating advertising and consumer protection 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or the other governmental regulations to which we or our customers are subject  we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
if we are required to obtain permits or licensure under these laws that we do not already possess  we may become subject to substantial additional regulation or incur significant expense 
any penalties  damages  fines  curtailment or restructuring of our operations would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations and additional legal or regulatory change 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses  divert our management s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 
product sales or introductions may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda regulatory process which could cause our sales or profitability to decline 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market a medical device from the fda and similar regulatory authorities abroad can be costly and time consuming  and we cannot assure you that such approvals and clearances will be granted 
pursuant to fda regulations  unless exempt  the fda permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received k clearance or is the subject of an approved pre market approval application 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other k cleared products 
the pre market approval application process is more costly  lengthy and uncertain than the k process  and must be supported by extensive data  including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials 
because we cannot assure you that any new products  or any product enhancements  that we develop will be subject to the shorter k clearance process  significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancement may occur 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not require a new product or product enhancement to go through the lengthy and expensive pre market approval application process 
delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals may delay or eliminate commercialization of products we develop  require us to perform costly procedures  diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  and reduce our ability to collect revenues or royalties 

table of contents although we have obtained k clearance from the fda to market our dental laser systems  we cannot assure you that the clearance of these systems will not be withdrawn or that we will not be required to obtain new clearances or approvals for modifications or improvements to our products 
our products are subject to recall even after receiving fda clearance or approval  any recalls would harm our reputation  business and financial results 
the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling 
any recall would divert management s attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers 
any recall involving our laser systems would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results because the laser systems compose such an important part of our portfolio of products 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by provisions of the affordable care act 
under the affordable care act  we are subject to a excise tax payable semi monthly on us revenues of certain medical devices beginning in january these taxes are imposed on us whether or not we earn a profit 
a significant portion of our product sales to customers located in the us will be subject to this tax 
this tax may adversely impact our operating results if we are not able to offset the cost by raising laser sales prices or through other cost improvements 
the affordable care act also contains reporting requirements of certain payments made by us to medical and dental practitioners and teaching hospitals the physician payment sunshine act which will be published on a publicly available website annually beginning in this requirement is expected to increase the administrative costs for both manufacturers and health care providers and may result in a decline in our collaborative efforts 
a decline in these collaborations may adversely affect advances in our laser technology or may reduce attendance at events at which our technology is demonstrated  which could reduce demand for our products and lead to sales price pressures 
additionally  the affordable care act may adversely impact third party reimbursements received by our end user customers  which may reduce demand for our products 
there may be other provisions in the law that could adversely affect our business  and we cannot predict with any certainty the full impact this legislation may have on our business 
risks related to our business and operations any failure to significantly expand sales of our products with our distribution partners will negatively impact our business 
we currently handle a significant portion of the marketing  distribution  and sales of our products 
we also utilize our relationships with domestic and international distributors to market  distribute  and sell our products 
we face significant challenges and risks in expanding  training  managing  and retaining our sales and marketing teams  including managing geographically dispersed operations 
we rely on independent distributors to market and sell our products in a number of countries outside of the united states 
these distributors may not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products  and they may terminate their relationships with us at any time with limited notice 
if we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities domestically and internationally  or if the relationship with our distribution partners does not produce the expected results  we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products  which could harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may incur problems in manufacturing our products which may harm our business 
in order to grow our business  we must expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce the systems and accessories necessary to meet any demand we may experience 
we may encounter difficulties in increasing the 
table of contents production of our products  including problems involving production capacity and yields  quality control and assurance  component supply  and shortages of qualified personnel 
in addition  before we can begin commercial manufacture of our products  we must ensure our manufacturing facilities  processes  and quality systems  and the manufacture of our laser systems comply with fda regulations governing facility compliance  quality control  and documentation policies and procedures 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to periodic inspections by the fda  as well as various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies 
from time to time  we may expend significant resources in obtaining  maintaining and remedying our compliance with these requirements 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with the fda s qsr and other regulatory requirements 
we have experienced quality issues with components of our products supplied by third parties 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing our products on a timely basis with acceptable manufacturing costs  while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements  our business could be harmed 
components used in our products are complex in design and any defects may not be discovered prior to shipment to customers 
these defects could result in warranty obligations which would increase our cost and may negatively affect our operating results and our reputation 
in manufacturing our products  we depend upon third parties for the supply of various components 
many of these components require a significant degree of technical expertise to design and produce 
if we fail to adequately design  or if our suppliers fail to produce components to specification  or if the suppliers  or we  use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process  the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised 
we have experienced such non compliance with manufacturing specifications in the past and may continue to experience such non compliance in the future  which could lead to higher costs and reduced gross margins 
our products may contain defects that cannot be repaired easily and inexpensively  and we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future some or all of the following loss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment  damage to our brand reputation  increased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement  inability to attract new customers  diversion of resources from our manufacturing and research and development departments into our service department  and legal action 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could materially harm our business 
product liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation 
the sale of dental and medical devices involves the risk of product liability claims against us 
claims could exceed our product liability insurance coverage limits 
our insurance policies are subject to various standard coverage exclusions  including damage to the product itself  losses from recall of our product and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us  nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  any product liability claim brought against us could result in harm to our reputation  decreased demand for our products  costs related to litigation  product recalls  loss of revenue  an increase in our product liability insurance rates  or the inability to secure coverage in the future  and may cause our business to suffer 

table of contents our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of materials and components or materials and components of adequate quality 
we frequently do not use written supply contracts with our key suppliers  instead  we purchase certain materials and components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers using purchase orders 
our business depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials and components in acceptable quality and quantities from our suppliers 
certain components of our products  particularly specialized components used in our lasers  are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
for example  the crystal  fiber  and hand pieces used in our waterlase systems are each supplied by a separate single supplier 
our dependence on single source suppliers involves several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality  and delivery schedules 
if any one or more of our single source suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  or cease to manufacture components of acceptable quality  we would have to seek alternative sources of manufacturing 
we could incur delays while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage acceptable alternative suppliers on favorable terms 
any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our business efforts and adversely affect our ability to generate sales 
our reliance on these outside manufacturers and suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business  including we may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms  we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for the various components in our laser systems  switching components may require product redesign and submission to the fda of a k application  which could significantly delay production  our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers  and fluctuations in demand for the products those suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components for us in a timely manner  and our suppliers may encounter financial hardships  be acquired  or experience other business events unrelated to our demand for components  which could inhibit or prevent their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements 
any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials  or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner  could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive procedures 
we are currently in the process of identifying and qualifying alternate source suppliers for our key components 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us 
rapidly changing standards and competing technologies could harm demand for our products or result in significant additional costs 
the markets in which our products compete are subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in the regulatory environment  and frequent introductions of new devices and evolving dental and surgical techniques 
competing products may emerge which could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete 
the process of developing new medical devices is inherently complex and requires regulatory approvals or clearances that can be expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  identify new and innovative applications of our technology  or be financially or otherwise capable of completing the research and development required to bring new products to market in a timely manner 
an inability to expand our product offerings or the application of our technology could limit our growth 
in addition  we may incur higher manufacturing costs if manufacturing processes or standards change  and we may need to replace  modify  design or build and install equipment  all of which would require additional capital expenditures 

table of contents we have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our net revenue and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities 
for the fiscal years ended december    and  international sales accounted for approximately   and of our net revenue  respectively 
political and economic conditions outside the united states could make it difficult for us to increase our international revenue or to operate abroad 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including among others adverse changes in tariffs and trade restrictions  political  social and economic instability and increased security concerns  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  exposure to different legal standards  transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels  reduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries  difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import  and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses  and compliance with foreign laws  the imposition of governmental controls  unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value added tax systems 
we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue  and we intend to expand our international operations further 
in international markets where our sales are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the relative value of the dollar against the currency in such markets could indirectly increase the price of our products in those markets and result in a decrease in sales 
we do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations  although we may consider doing so in the future 
fluctuations in our revenue and operating results on a quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our revenue and operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
historically  we have experienced fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter due to seasonality 
revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental professionals 
in addition  revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors  analysts or our previously stated financial guidance  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
other factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and operating results include the following variation in demand for our products  including seasonality  our ability to research  develop  market  and sell new products and product enhancements in a timely manner  our ability to control costs  our ability to control quality issues with our products  
table of contents regulatory actions that impact our manufacturing processes  the size  timing  rescheduling  or cancellation of orders from distributors  the introduction of new products by competitors  the length of and fluctuations in sales cycles  the availability and reliability of components used to manufacture our products  changes in our pricing policies or those of our suppliers and competitors  as well as increased price competition in general  legal expenses  particularly related to litigation matters  general economic conditions including the availability of credit for our existing and potential customer base to finance purchases  the mix of our domestic and international sales and the risks and uncertainties associated with international business  costs associated with any future acquisitions of technologies and businesses  limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards under the provisions of irc section and similar state laws  developments concerning the protection of our intellectual property rights  catastrophic events such as hurricanes  floods  and earthquakes  which can affect our ability to advertise  sell  and distribute our products  including through national conferences held in regions in which these disasters strike  and global economic  political  and social events  including international conflicts and acts of terrorism 
the expenses we incur are based  in large part  on our expectations regarding future net revenue 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses if we experience a decrease in net revenue 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
the continued financial crisis and general slowdown of the economy may adversely affect the credit availability and liquidity of our customers and suppliers 
the credit availability and liquidity of our customers and suppliers may be materially affected by the current financial crisis 
if our suppliers experience credit or liquidity problems  important sources of raw materials or manufactured goods may be affected 
we currently sell our products primarily to dentists in general practice 
these dentists often purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third party financial institutions  including credit facilities and short term loans 
if interest rates increase or the availability of credit is otherwise negatively impacted by market conditions  these financing arrangements will be more expensive to our dental customers  which would effectively increase the overall cost of owning our products for our customers and  thereby  may decrease demand for our products 
the recent recession made  and may continue to make  such funding less readily available 
any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer 
we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business  including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters  employment matters  commercial disputes  competition and sales and trading practices  environmental matters  personal injury  and 
table of contents insurance coverage 
some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well a compensatory damages 
the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management s attention  we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition  operations and results of operations 
moreover  any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to record loss contingency estimates in our financial statements  which could adversely affect our results of operations in any period 
our operations are consolidated primarily in one facility 
a disruption at this facility could result in a prolonged interruption of our business and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
substantially all of our administrative operations and our manufacturing operations are located at our facility in irvine  california  which is near known earthquake fault zones 
we have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities including disaster recovery planning and off site backup of computer data  however  a natural disaster such as an earthquake  fire or flood  could seriously harm our business  adversely affect our operations and damage our reputation with customers 
additionally  labor disputes  maintenance requirements  power outages  equipment failures  civil unrest or terrorist attacks affecting our irvine  california facility may materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our business interruption insurance coverage may not cover all or any of our losses from natural disasters or other disruptions 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  or if we are unable to attract other key personnel  we may not be able to manage our operations or meet our growth objectives 
we are highly dependent on our senior management  especially federico pignatelli  our chief executive officer  fred furry  our chief financial officer and chief operating officer  and other key officers 
we are also heavily dependent on our engineers and sales and marketing personnel and other highly skilled technical personnel 
our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management  engineers and marketing and sales team and other technical personnel and to attract and retain qualified like personnel in the future 
competition for senior management  engineers  marketing and sales personnel and other specialized technicians is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel 
the loss of the services of members of our key personnel could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives  including the development and introduction of our products 
in general  our officers may terminate their employment at any time without notice for any reason 
existing or future acquisitions of businesses could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or if we discover previously undisclosed liabilities 
successful acquisitions depend upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing 
we expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies  products and businesses that could enhance our capabilities  complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies 
even if we complete acquisitions  we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel  products  and other assets into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company  product  or other assets  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions 

table of contents in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize expenses and acquired assets 
we may also discover deficiencies in internal controls  data adequacy and integrity  product quality  regulatory compliance  and product liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition of such businesses  which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities 
any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and result of operations 
if we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of and section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  our business  results of operations and financial condition and investors confidence in us could be materially and adversely affected 
as a public company  we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  including preparing annual reports  quarterly reports  and current reports 
our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of the nasdaq stock market llc expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms  or at all 
section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act added section p to the securities exchange act of which requires us to disclose annually whether any conflict minerals  including tantalum  tin  gold and tungsten  that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by us originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country 
components of our products containing these minerals are sourced through various vendors who may have complex supply chains which may change from time to time due to the influence of availability  pricing or other factors in their purchasing decisions 
we are required to conduct a good faith and reasonable effort to determine the source of these materials  however  there can be no assurance that members in the supply chain will be willing or able to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or notify us timely of changes 
we must comply with the final rule for the calendar year beginning january  with the first reports due may in addition  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended the sarbanes oxley act  we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting 
during the course of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting  we may identify areas requiring improvement and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review 
this could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources  including management time from other activities 
in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud 
any failure to maintain the requirements of section on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm our business  negatively impact the trading price of our stock  and adversely affect investors confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing 
climate change initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business 
our manufacturing processes require that we purchase significant quantities of energy from third parties  which results in the generation of greenhouse gases  either directly on site or indirectly at electric utilities 
both domestic and international legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a price on carbon could create increases in energy costs and price volatility 
considerable international attention is now focused on development of an international policy framework to address climate change 
proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect our energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from sources that generate 
table of contents greenhouse gas emissions 
if our suppliers are unable to obtain energy at a reasonable cost in the future  the cost of our raw materials may be negatively impacted which could result in increased manufacturing costs 
risks related to our stock our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value 
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities  which is often unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities 
these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our stock 
the market price and volume of our common stock may fluctuate  and in the past has fluctuated  more dramatically than the stock market in general 
you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors 
some specific factors  in addition to the other risk factors identified above  that may have a significant effect on our stock market price  many of which we cannot control 
these include but are not limited to actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects  our announcements or our competitors announcements of new products  the public s reaction to our press releases  our other public announcements and our filings with the sec  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations  or principles  changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors  our inability to raise additional capital as needed  concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products  changes in financial markets or general economic conditions  sales of stock by us or members of our management team  our board of directors  or certain institutional stockholders  and changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock  other comparable companies or our industry generally 
you could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding convertible securities or the future grant of equity by us 
you could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of outstanding options and warrants issued as incentive compensation for services performed by employees  directors  consultants and others or the grant of future equity awarded by us 
as of december   an aggregate of  shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan   of which were subject to options outstanding as of that date at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in addition  as of december    shares of our common stock were subject to warrants at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
of the  outstanding stock options at december    stock options were exercisable 
to the extent that outstanding options are exercised  our existing stockholders may incur dilution 
we rely heavily on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees 
the grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers may further dilute our stockholders 
we also expect to issue additional shares of our equity securities to raise capital 
during  we sold approximately million shares of common stock through a controlled equity offering for gross proceeds totaling approximately million 
we also sold an aggregate of million shares in a private placement for gross proceeds totaling approximately million 
our board of 
table of contents directors declared a stock dividend and a stock dividend in each of the four quarters in and  respectively  which resulted in the issuance of  shares and  shares  respectively 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company and reduce the market price of our stock 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of blank check preferred stock 
as a result  without further stockholder approval  the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights  including voting and dividend rights  to this preferred stock 
with these rights  preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law 
under these provisions  if anyone becomes an interested stockholder  we may not enter into a business combination with that person for three years without special approval  which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us 
an interested stockholder generally means subject to certain exceptions as described in the delaware general corporation law someone owning or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the stockholder rights plan  if any party acquires or more of our outstanding common stock while the stockholder rights plan remains in place  subject to a number of exceptions set forth in the plan  the holders of these rights  other than the party acquiring the position  will be able to purchase shares of our common stock  or other securities or assets  at a discounted price  causing substantial dilution to the party acquiring the position 
following the acquisition of or more of our stock by any person  without a redemption of the rights or a termination of the stockholder rights plan by the board of directors  if we are acquired by or merged with any other entity  holders of these rights  other than the party acquiring the position  will also be able to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiring or surviving entity if the stockholder rights plan continues to remain in place 
our stockholder rights plan could discourage a takeover attempt and make an unsolicited takeover of our company more difficult 
as a result  without the approval of our board of directors  you may not have the opportunity to sell your shares to a potential acquirer of us at a premium over prevailing market prices 
this could reduce the market price of our stock 
we may elect to not declare cash dividends on our stock  or may elect to only pay dividends on an infrequent or irregular basis  and any return on your investment may be limited to the value of our stock 
our board of directors may from time to time declare  and we may pay  cash dividends on our outstanding shares of common stock in the manner and upon the terms and conditions provided by law 
however  we may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business  rather than paying cash dividends on our stock 
any payment of cash dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  business prospects  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
in the event our board of directors declares any cash dividends  there is no assurance with respect to the amount  timing  or frequency of any such dividends 
risks related to our revolving credit facilities the terms of our revolving credit facilities impose financial and operating restrictions on us and failure to comply may have an adverse effect on our business  liquidity and financial position 
our revolving credit facilities contain a number of negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities 
these covenants limit or restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness and grant liens on assets  
table of contents make certain investments and restricted payments including the ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase stock  undertake certain acquisitions or sell certain assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  and replace our chief executive officer or chief financial officer  unless our board of directors determines  in good faith  exigent circumstances require their prompt replacement 
these limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests 
further  the revolving credit facilities subject us to various reporting covenants and financial covenants which require us to maintain certain levels of debt ratios and minimum earnings before income taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
the lockbox arrangements under the revolving bank facilities provide that substantially all of the income generated is deposited directly into lockbox accounts and then swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of the bank 
cash is disbursed to us only after payment of the applicable debt service and principal 
our ability to borrow under the revolving bank facilities is subject to compliance with the negative and financial covenants 
if we breach any of the covenants in our revolving credit facilities  we may be in default under our revolving credit facilities 
if we default  our borrowings under the revolving credit facilities could be declared due and payable  including accrued interest and other fees

stock repurchase program on august   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program  pursuant to which we may repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our outstanding common stock 
the stock repurchase program became effective on august  we expect to fund the stock repurchase program with existing cash and cash equivalents on hand 
any shares repurchased will be retired and shall resume the status of authorized and unissued shares 
repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time through a variety of methods  including open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or block transactions 
we have no obligation to repurchase shares under the stock repurchase program  and the timing  actual number and value of the shares that are repurchased will be at the discretion of our management and will depend upon a number of considerations  including the trading price of our common stock  general market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors
