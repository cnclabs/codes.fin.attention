item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of december  and you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report or incorporated herein by reference 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the sections of this report entitled cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors for discussion of some of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview through skywest airlines and expressjet  we operate the largest regional airline in the united states 
as of december   skywest airlines and expressjet offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately  total daily departures to destinations in the united states  canada  mexico and the caribbean 
as of december   we operated a combined fleet of aircraft consisting of the following crj erj erj crj crj emb total united delta us airways american alaska subleased to an un affiliated entity subleased to an affiliated entity total for the year ended december   approximately of our aggregate capacity was operated for united  approximately was operated for delta  approximately was operated for alaska  approximately was operated for us airways and approximately was operated for american 
under a fixed fee flying arrangement  the major airline generally pays the regional airline a fixed fee for each departure  with additional incentives based on completion of flights  on time performance and baggage handling performance 
in addition  the major and regional airline often enter into an arrangement pursuant to which the major airline bears the risk of changes in the price of fuel 
table of contents and other such costs that are passed through to the major airline partner 
regional airlines benefit from a fixed fee arrangement because they are sheltered from most of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance  including variations in ticket prices  passenger loads and fuel prices 
however  regional airlines in fixed fee arrangements do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices  passenger loads or fuel prices and  because the major airline absorbs most of the costs associated with the regional airline flight  the margin between the fixed fees for a flight and the expected per flight costs tends to be smaller than the margins associated with revenue sharing arrangements 
under our fixed fee arrangements  two compensation components have a significant impact on comparability of revenue and operating expense for the periods presented 
one item is the reimbursement of fuel expense  which is a directly reimbursed expense under all of our fixed fee arrangements 
our major partners directly reimburse us for fuel expense incurred under each respective fixed fee contract and we record such reimbursement as passenger revenue 
thus  the price volatility of fuel and the volume of fuel expensed under our fixed fee arrangements will impact our fuel expense and our passenger revenue equally  with no impact on our operating income 
the second item is the compensation we receive for engine maintenance under our fixed fee arrangements 
under our united  american  us airways and alaska flying contracts  a portion of our compensation is based upon fixed hourly rates  which is intended to compensate us for engine maintenance costs fixed rate engine contracts 
under the compensation structure for our delta connection and united cpa flying contracts  our major partner directly reimburses us for engine maintenance expense when the expense is incurred directly reimbursed engine contracts 
we use the direct expense method of accounting for our crj regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs and  accordingly  we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj engines on an as incurred basis 
under the direct expense method  the maintenance liability is recorded when the maintenance services are performed crj engine overhaul expense 
because we use the direct expense method of accounting for our crj engine expense  and because we recognize revenue using the applicable fixed hourly rates under our fixed rate engine contracts  the number of engine maintenance events and related expense we incur each reporting period under the fixed rate engine contracts has a direct impact on the comparability of our operating income for the presented reporting periods 
the crj engine overhaul expense incurred under the fixed rate engine contracts decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in crj engine overhaul expense was primarily due to a reduction in the number of scheduled engine maintenance events during the year ended december  because we recognize revenue when we incur engine maintenance expense on engines operating under our directly reimbursed engine contracts  the number of engine events and related expense we incur each reporting period does not have a direct impact on the comparability of our operating income for the presented reporting periods 
we have an agreement with a third party vendor to provide long term engine maintenance covering scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs operating under our fixed rate engine contracts power by the hour agreement 
under the terms of the power by the hour agreement  we are obligated to pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
thus  under the power by the hour agreement  we expense the engine maintenance costs as flight hours are incurred on the engines and using the contractual rate set forth in the agreement 
because we record engine maintenance expense based on the fixed hourly rate pursuant to the power by the hour agreement on our crjs operating under our fixed rate engine contracts  and because we recognize revenue using the applicable fixed hourly rates under our fixed rate engine contracts  the number of engine events and related expense we incur each reporting 
table of contents period does not have a direct impact on the comparability of our operating income for the presented reporting periods 
the table below summarizes how we are compensated by our major partners under our flying contracts for engine expense and the method we use to recognize the corresponding expense 
flying contract compensation of engine expense expense recognition skywest delta connection directly reimbursed engine contracts direct expense method expressjet delta connection directly reimbursed engine contracts direct expense method skywest united express crj fixed rate engine contracts direct expense method skywest united express crj fixed rate engine contracts power by the hour agreement skywest united express emb fixed rate engine contracts deferral method expressjet united express crj fixed rate engine contracts direct expense method expressjet united express erj fixed rate engine contracts power by the hour agreement expressjet united cpa directly reimbursed engine contracts power by the hour agreement alaska agreement fixed rate engine contracts power by the hour agreement american eagle agreement crj fixed rate engine contracts direct expense method us airways express crj fixed rate engine contracts direct expense method historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled us to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of contract flying and our controlled or pro rate flying 
for the year ended december   contract flying revenue and pro rate revenue represented approximately and  respectively  of our total passenger revenues 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
financial highlights we had revenues of billion for the year ended december   a decrease  compared to revenues of billion for the year ended december  we had a net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the significant items affecting our financial performance during the year ended december  are outlined below under certain of our flying contracts  certain expenses are subject to direct reimbursement from our major partners and we record such reimbursements as passenger revenue  including fuel and certain engine maintenance expenses 
our fuel expense and directly reimbursed engine expense decreased by million and million  respectively  during the year ended december   from the year ended december   due primarily to united purchasing an increased volume of fuel directly from vendors on flights we operated under our united express agreements and due to a reduction in the number of engine events from the prior year 
excluding the impact of the decrease in direct fuel and engine maintenance expense and associated reimbursements  our passenger revenues increased million for year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily due to an increase in block hour production  receipt of higher incentive payments and favorable compensation negotiations with our major partners 
because we use the direct expense method of accounting for our crj engines and because we recognize revenue using the applicable fixed hourly rates under our fixed rate engine contracts  the number of engine maintenance events and related expense we incur each reporting period operating under the fixed rate engine contracts has a direct impact on the comparability of our operating income for the presented reporting periods 
the crj engine overhaul expense incurred under the fixed rate engine contracts decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in crj engine overhaul expense 
table of contents was primarily due to a reduction in the number of scheduled engine maintenance events during the year ended december  aircraft maintenance expense  excluding reimbursed engine overhauls and engine overhauls for our crjs under our fixed rate engine contracts  decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in aircraft maintenance expense  excluding engine overhaul costs  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was principally due to fewer scheduled maintenance events and certain cost reduction initiatives undertaken during the year ended december  additionally  we experienced a million reduction in other operating expenses  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses was primarily due to the reduction in property tax expense resulting from refunds received during the year ended december   a reduction in simulator training expense and a reduction in legal and consulting expenses 
the items identified above were the principal factors that contributed to the significant improvement in our financial results during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  during  we reached an agreement with delta to add additional used dual class bombardier regional jet aircraft in exchange for the early termination of crj aircraft under our delta connection agreements 
the additional dual class aircraft were previously operated for delta by other regional carriers 
we anticipate the additional dual class aircraft will be subleased from delta for a nominal amount 
the additional aircraft consist of five crjs and crjs 
as of december   we had taken delivery of of the additional crjs and five of the additional crjs 
we anticipate that the remaining aircraft will be delivered by june we anticipate that all crj aircraft will be removed from the delta connection agreements by december  of the crjs scheduled to be removed  crjs are subleased from delta for a nominal amount  which are scheduled to be returned to delta without obligation to us 
during  we signed the american agreements  which provide for us to operate crjs 
the aircraft flown for american have been removed from our skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements 
we started our operations under the american agreements on november   with aircraft that are being flown out of los angeles international airport by skywest airlines 
the other aircraft were placed into service by expressjet on february  and are operated out of dallas fort worth international airport 
total available seat miles asms for the year ended december  increased  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated billion asms  compared to billion asms during the year ended december  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  stock based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as 
table of contents to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
our agreements with our code share partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the applicable code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
in the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we record that period revenues based on the lower of the prior period approved rates adjusted for the current contract negotiations and our estimate of rates that will be implemented 
also  in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and  provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute 
accordingly  we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
maintenance we use the direct expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs 
under this method  the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed 
we use the deferral method of accounting for our brasilia turboprop engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated to the next estimated overhaul event or to the remaining useful life  whichever is shorter 
for leased aircraft  we are subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
with respect to engine overhauls related to leased brasilia turboprops to be returned  we adjust the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
with respect to skywest airlines  a third party vendor provides our long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs operated under our fixed rate engine contracts 
under the terms of the vendor agreement  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
thus  under the third party vendor agreement  we expense the engine maintenance costs as flight hours are incurred on the engines and using the contractual rate set forth in the agreement 
aircraft leases the majority of skywest airlines aircraft are leased from third parties  while expressjet aircraft flying for delta are primarily debt financed on a long term basis  and the majority of expressjet aircraft flying for united are leased from united for a nominal amount 
in order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected 
table of contents in our consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately million in intangible assets 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of certain of these assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
we recorded an intangible of approximately million relating to the acquisition of atlantic southeast in september the intangible is being amortized over fifteen years under the straight line method 
as of december   we had recorded million in accumulated amortization expense 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
when considering whether or not impairment of long lived assets exists  we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for each asset group to the net carrying amount of the assets supporting the asset group 
asset groupings are done at the fleet or contract level 
based on the results of the evaluations performed as of december   our management concluded no impairment of long lived assets was necessary as of december  stock based compensation expense we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination in the option pricing model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and other factors 
fair value we hold certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with united states gaap 
we determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
some of our marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

table of contents we have valued non auction rate marketable securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if a quoted price is not available  we utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
for auction rate security instruments  quoted prices in active markets are no longer available 
as a result  we have estimated the fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow model

skywest airlines segment profit increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in skywest airline profit was due primarily to the following factors crj engine overhaul expense incurred under the skywest airlines fixed rate engine contracts decreased million 
the decrease in crj engine overhaul expense was primarily due to a reduction in the number of scheduled engine maintenance events 
non pass through operating revenue increased by million 
the increase in non pass through operating revenue  was primarily due to an increase in block hour production  receipt of higher incentive payments and favorable compensation negotiations with our major partners 
skywest airlines salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million primarily due to increased block hour production 

table of contents expressjet segment loss 
expressjet segment loss decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in expressjet loss was due primarily to the following factors non pass through operating revenue increased by million 
the increase in non pass through operating revenue  was primarily due to an increase in block hour production  our receipt of higher incentive payments and favorable compensation negotiations with our major partners 
expressjet salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million primarily due to integration benefits and aircraft scheduling inefficiencies experienced in that were not replicated during aircraft maintenance expense  excluding reimbursed engine overhauls  decreased million primarily due to a reduction in scheduled maintenance events and more efficient maintenance planning 
other expenses  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  decreased million primarily due to a reduction in new hire training from non aircraft depreciation and amortization expense decreased million primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in compared to operational statistics

we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj engines on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
under our fixed rate engine contracts  we recognize revenue at fixed hourly rates for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines 
accordingly  the timing of engine maintenance events associated with aircraft under the fixed rate engine contracts can have a significant impact on our financial results 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our fixed rate engine contracts decreased million compared to the year ended december  the decrease in crj engine overhauls reimbursed under our fixed rate engine contracts was principally due to fewer scheduled engine maintenance events 
we expect a reduction in the number of scheduled engine maintenance events on our crjs during under our directly reimbursed engine contracts  we are reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by our major partner at the time the maintenance event occurs 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

table of contents aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to aircraft lease renewals at lower rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation expense was primarily due to certain rotable assets being fully depreciated during and a lower volume of capital expenditures 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to our major partners paying for certain station rents and landing fees directly to the applicable airports 
ground handling service 
ground handling service expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in ground handling service expense was primarily due to a reduction in outsourced ground handling services resulting from the termination of skywest airlines airtran code share agreement during the year ended december  acquisition related costs

table of contents excluding fuel and engine overhaul costs and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rates  our total airline expenses decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the percentage decrease in total airline expenses  excluding fuel and engine overhauls  was different than the percentage increase in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements from major partners  due primarily to the factors described above 
summary of other income expense items other expenses  net 
other expenses  net decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  other expenses primarily consist of earnings and losses from our investments in trip and air mekong  which we account for under the equity method of accounting 
the decrease in other expenses was due primarily to our recognition of our portion of the losses incurred by trip and air mekong during the applicable periods 
adjustment to purchase accounting gain 
in connection with the preparation of expressjet tax return  an adjustment to the expressjet acquisition accounting was identified that resulted in an increase to the acquired deferred tax liabilities of million  which was reflected on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss under the caption purchase accounting gain adjustment for the year ended december  we did not incur comparable expenses during the year ended december  income taxes expense 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was higher than the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to state income taxes and expenses we incurred with limited tax deductibility relative to our pre tax income for the year 
additionally  in conjunction with the preparation of the expressjet income tax return during the year ended december   we revised our estimate of the expressjet post acquisition tax loss recorded as a deferred tax asset as of december   which resulted in a million benefit 
net income loss

skywest airlines segment profit decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in skywest airlines profit was due primarily to aircraft maintenance expense  excluding reimbursed engine overhauls  which increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  expressjet segment profit loss 
expressjet segment loss was million during the year ended december   compared to a segment profit of million for the year ended december  the decrease in expressjet profit was due to the following factors on november   the company acquired expressjet delaware 
expressjet delaware incurred a segment loss of million during the year ended december   primarily due to integration inefficiencies and duplicate cost structures during expressjet crj aircraft maintenance expense  excluding reimbursed engine overhauls  increased million  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  expressjet crj non pass through operating revenue decreased primarily due to the implementation of the second lowest rate provision in the expressjet delta connection agreement that was agreed upon during the fourth quarter of

passenger revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
our passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements from major partners  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements  was primarily due to an increase in block hours of during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the block hour increase was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
the increase in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements  was less than the increase in block hours primarily due to differences between the united express agreement and our other code share agreements 
under the united express agreement  united pays for more costs directly such as station rents and aircraft ownership and as such  there are no associated reimbursements recognized as revenue on costs paid directly by united 
under our other code share agreements  the majority of those costs are paid by skywest and expressjet and the reimbursements received from their major partners are included in revenue 
as such we do not expect the expressjet operations to increase revenue at the same rate as the projected increase in block hours 

table of contents in addition  the delta connection agreements also provide that  beginning with the fifth anniversary of the execution of the agreements september   delta has the right to require that certain contractual rates under those agreements shall not exceed the second lowest rates of all carriers within the delta connection program 
during the fourth quarter of  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast reached an agreement with delta on contractual rates satisfying the second lowest rate provision and agreed on rates through december  delta additionally waived its right to require that the contractual rates payable under the delta connection agreements shall not exceed the second lowest of all carriers within the delta connection program through december  as a result of the negotiated adjustment of the contractual rates under the delta connection agreements  our passenger revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million lower than they would have been under the rates that existed prior to the adjustment 
additionally  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast finalized certain contractual rates from september  through december  with delta 
as a result  we recorded million in additional revenue as a result of the finalization of contractual rates during the quarter ended december  under the terms of the skywest airlines and expressjet delta connection agreements  delta has agreed to compensate skywest airlines and expressjet for initiatives that directly result in pass through cost savings 
delta agreed to share such savings with skywest airlines and expressjet on an equal basis for a twelve month period 
during the three months ended december   delta paid  and skywest airlines and atlantic southeast recognized  approximately million in cost savings revenue 
we did not receive similar payments during the year ended december  in addition  under our expressjet delta connection agreement and our skywest airlines and expressjet united express agreements we are paid an incentive compensation upon the achievement of certain performance criteria 
our passenger revenues for the year ended december  were million lower  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to our receipt of lower incentive payments 
ground handling and other 
total ground handling and other revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue attributed to ground handling services for our aircraft is reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss under the heading passenger revenues and revenue attributed to handling third party aircraft is reflected in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss under the heading ground handling and other 
the increase in ground handling and other revenues was primarily related to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger and aircraft rental revenue received from other airlines 
during the year ended december   we obtained leases for four crjs and subleased those aircraft to air mekong 
individual expense components attributable to our operations are expressed in the following table on the basis of cents per asm 
asm is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline passenger capacity 
asms reflect both the number of aircraft in an airline fleet and the seat capacity for the aircraft in the fleet 
as the size of our fleet is the underlying driver of our operating costs  the primary basis for our presentation of the following information on a cost per asm basis is to

fuel costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average cost per gallon of fuel increased to per gallon during the year ended december   from during the year ended december  the amount fuel costs incurred under our revenue sharing arrangements increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased directly  and the change in fuel price per gallon on our fuel expense  for the periods indicated for the year ended december  in thousands  except per gallon amounts change fuel gallons purchased average price per gallon fuel expense salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   due primarily to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs

we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
under our fixed rate engine contracts  we recognize revenue at fixed hourly rates for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines 
accordingly  the timing of engine maintenance events associated with aircraft under fixed rate engine contracts can have a significant impact on our financial results 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our fixed rate engine contracts increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase in crj engine overhauls reimbursed under our fixed rate engine contracts was principally due to scheduled engine maintenance events 
under our directly reimbursed engine contracts  we are reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by our major partners at the time the maintenance event occurs 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rental expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
approximately  million of the additional aircraft rental expense was attributable to aircraft operated under the expressjet united express agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
without the expansion of the expressjet delaware operations  station rentals and landing fees would have decreased  primarily due to our major partners paying for certain station rents and landing fees directly to the applicable airports 
ground handling service 
ground handling service expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in ground handling service expense was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 

table of contents acquisition related costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of direct severance  legal and advisor fees associated with the expressjet merger and integration related costs  including advisory fees to assist atlantic southeast and expressjet in their efforts to operate under a single operating certificate 
other expenses 
other expenses  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in other expenses was primarily due to the expansion of our operations following the completion of the expressjet merger 
interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in long term debt 
at december   we had  million of long term debt  compared to  million of debt as of december  total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses increased  million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
we record the amount of those reimbursements as revenue 
under the directly reimbursed engine contract and the united cpa  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expense  which we record as revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of fuel and engine overhaul expenses which are included in our total airline expenses for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands

interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was due primarily to the retirement of a secured term loan that united repaid on august   which had an interest rate of 
other  net 
other expenses  net  increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  other expenses primarily consist of earnings and losses from our investments in trip and air mekong  which we account for under the equity 
table of contents method of accounting 
the increase in other expense was due primarily to our recognition of our portion of the losses incurred by trip and air mekong 
purchase accounting gain adjustment 
in connection with our preparation of the tax return  our management identified an adjustment to the expressjet acquisition accounting that resulted in an increase to the acquired deferred tax liabilities of million 
the adjustment is reflected on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  under the caption purchase accounting gain adjustment 
net income loss 
primarily due to factors described above  we incurred a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash cash position and liquidity 
the following table provides a summary of the net cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december  and  and our total cash and marketable securities position as of december  and december  in thousands

net cash provided by our operating activities increased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in our pre tax income during the year ended december   compared to our pre tax loss during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we had a pre tax income of million compared to a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  the remainder of the increase was due primarily to changes in our working capital accounts 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in our investing activities increased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of marketable securities during the year ended december   compared to our net sales of marketable securities during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we had net purchases of marketable securities of million compared to net sales of marketable securities of million for the year ended december  
table of contents during the year ended december   we did not make any deposits on aircraft  compared to million of deposits on aircraft that we made during the year ended december  in addition  the acquisition of aircraft and rotable spare parts decreased by million as compared to the year ended december  cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in our financing activities increased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to an increase in principal payments on long term debt of million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the amount we spent to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock 
during the year ended december   we spent million to repurchase shares of common stock  compared to million for stock repurchases during the year ended december  in addition  the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt during the year ended december  decreased by million as compared to the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we believe that in the absence of unusual circumstances  the working capital currently available to us  together with our projected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our present financial requirements  including anticipated expansion  planned capital expenditures  and scheduled lease payments and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
at december   our total capital mix was equity and long term debt  compared to equity and long term debt at december  as of december  and  skywest airlines had a million line of credit 
as of december  and  skywest airlines had no amount outstanding under the facility 
the facility is scheduled to expire on march  and has a fixed interest rate of as of december   we had million in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions 
as of december  and  we classified million and million as restricted cash  respectively  related to our workers compensation policies 

table of contents significant commitments and obligations general the following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations interest commitments a principal maturities on long term debt total commitments and obligations a at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt 
actual interest commitments will change based on the actual variable interest 
purchase commitments and options we have not historically funded a substantial portion of our aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long term debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us  and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
in the event that alternative financing cannot be arranged at the time of delivery  bombardier has typically financed our aircraft acquisitions until more permanent arrangements can be made 
subsequent to this initial acquisition of an aircraft  we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  we intend to fund our acquisition of any additional aircraft through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with our historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for our operating activities 
nonetheless  recent disruptions in the credit markets have resulted in greater volatility  decreased liquidity and limited availability of capital  and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary funding or that  if we are able to obtain necessary capital  the corresponding terms will be favorable or acceptable to us 
aircraft lease and facility obligations we also have significant long term lease obligations  primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
at december   we had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  
table of contents long term debt obligations as of december   we had billion of long term debt obligations related to the acquisition of crj  crj and crj aircraft 
the average effective interest rate on the debt related to the crj aircraft was approximately at december  guarantees we have guaranteed the obligations of skywest airlines under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement and the obligations of expressjet under the expressjet delta connection agreement 
we have also guaranteed the obligations of expressjet under the united cpa 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  we have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs 
pursuant to our contract flying arrangements  united  delta  alaska  american and us airways have agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted flights 
we bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our pro rate operations 
for the year ended december   approximately of our asms were flown under pro rate arrangements 
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of the market risk of fuel on our pro rate operations using a hypothetical increase of in the price per gallon we purchase 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in fuel expense for the year ended december  interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
we would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of our available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt compared to of our long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december   and we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  however  under our contractual arrangement with our major partners  the majority of the increase in interest expense would be passed through and recorded as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 
if interest rates were to decline  our major partners would receive the principal benefit of the decline  since interest expense is generally passed through to our major partners  resulting in a reduction to passenger revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss 
we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through manufacturer financing  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact the actual cost to us to acquire these aircraft 
to the extent we place these aircraft in service under our code share agreements with delta  united  or other carriers  our code share agreements currently provide that reimbursement rates will be adjusted higher or lower to reflect changes in our aircraft rental rates 

table of contents auction rate securities we have investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as available for sale securities and reflected at fair value 
as of december   we had investments in auction rate securities valued at a total of million which were classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheet
