overview we are a network specialist focused on networking solutions that enable converged  next generation architectures  optimized to handle the broad array of high bandwidth communications services relied upon by business and consumer end users 
we provide equipment  software and services that support the transport  switching  aggregation  service delivery and management of voice  video and data traffic on communications networks 
our converged packet optical  packet networking  optical transport and software products are used  individually or as part of an integrated  programmable solution  in networks operated by communications service providers  cable operators  governments  enterprises  research and education institutions  content service providers and other network operators across the globe 
our products allow network operators to scale capacity  increase transmission speeds  allocate network traffic and deliver services to end users 
our network solutions also include an integrated software suite that provides network and service management capabilities that unify our product portfolio  facilitating automation and software defined programmability to enable efficient service delivery 
to complement our product portfolio  we offer a broad range of network transformation solutions and related support services that help our customers design  optimize  deploy  manage and maintain their networks 
we believe that the close  collaborative partnership with customers enabled by our engagement model and services offering is an important component of our network specialist approach and a significant differentiator for ciena with our customers 
rapid proliferation of and reliance by end users upon communications services and devices  increased mobility and growth in cloud based services have fundamentally affected the demands placed upon communications networks and how they are designed 
network operators face a challenging and rapidly changing environment that requires that their network infrastructures be robust enough to address increasing capacity needs and be flexible enough to adapt to new application and service offerings 
network operators are competing to distinguish their service offerings to end users and generate revenue  while managing the costs required to implement and maintain their networks 
to address these business  infrastructure and service delivery challenges  we believe network operators need a flexible infrastructure that can be adapted to support a variety of applications and controlled through the use of software 
our op n architecture is designed to meet these challenges by providing increased scalability and programmability  as well as network level software applications to control and configure the network dynamically 
through this network approach  we seek to enable high capacity  configurable infrastructures that can adapt to the changing needs of end users and the applications that they require  while providing flexible interfaces for the integration of computing  storage and network resources 
by increasing network flexibility for service delivery  reducing required network elements and enabling increased scale at reduced cost  our solutions simplify networks 
at the same time  our approach facilitates the creation of new service offerings  creating business and operational value for our customers 
our op n architecture  which underpins our solutions offering and guides our research and development strategy  is described more fully in the strategy section of the description of our business under item of part of this annual report

table of contents market opportunity and strategy we believe that the shift that is underway in network architectures to next generation  converged infrastructures represents significant  long term opportunities for our business 
we believe that market trends underlying this shift  including the proliferation of devices running mobile web applications  the prevalence of video applications  the increase in machine to machine connections  and the shift of enterprise and consumer applications to cloud based or virtualized network environments  are indicative of increasing use and dependence by consumers and enterprises upon a growing variety of broadband applications and services 
we expect that these drivers will continue to require network operators to invest in converged next generation network infrastructures that are more automated  open and software programmable 
our corporate strategy to capitalize on these market dynamics  promote operational efficiency and drive profitable growth of our business includes the initiatives set forth in the strategy section of the description of our business in item of part of this annual report 
global market conditions and competitive landscape during fiscal  we gained considerable momentum in our business and financial results and experienced a steadily improving market environment  particularly as reflected in the spending patterns and decisions of our largest north american service provider customers 
we believe that this spending reflects customer preference of  and a shift in network spending toward  high capacity  next generation network architectures 
improved conditions during fiscal followed a lengthy period of macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility  which caused cautious customer behavior in our industry and markets 
these conditions  most notably in europe  had previously resulted in lower levels of capital expenditure on communications network infrastructure 
because the market opportunity and improved conditions during fiscal described above are in their early stages  we remain uncertain as to their longer term effect on the growth of our markets and business  as well as our results of operations 
although we are beginning to see network operators adopt converged network architectures that align well with our op n architecture and solutions offering  particularly in north america  competition in our sector remains significant 
we continue to encounter a highly competitive marketplace  particularly for our converged packet optical products  as we and our competitors have introduced new  high capacity  high speed network solutions and have aggressively sought to capture market share 
in this intense and fragmented competitive environment  securing new opportunities  particularly in international markets  often requires that we agree to unfavorable commercial terms that can elongate the revenue recognition cycle  add startup costs to deployment of our solutions in customer networks  require financial commitments or performance bonds that place cash resources at risk  and other onerous contractual commitments that place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon the vendor 
these terms can adversely affect our results of operations and contribute to fluctuations in our results 
we expect the competitive landscape to remain challenging and dynamic as we and other multinational equipment vendors introduce new  competing  next generation platforms  seek adoption of network architectural approaches and compete to obtain new business or retain incumbent positions with large customers around the world 
as networking technologies  features or layers converge  our competitive landscape may broaden beyond traditional competitors to include additional competitors focused on ip routing  information technology and software 
operational reorganization to address the growing need to transport  aggregate and manage multiple types of services  network operators are increasingly demanding and adopting solutions that enable the convergence of both network functions and network layers  particularly the integration of transport  otn switching and packet switching capabilities 
our op n architecture and our continued development and addition of features to our solutions portfolio are intended to address the market and networking design dynamics faced by network operators 
specifically  we continue to converge otn switching and packet switching functionality into our coherent optical transport solutions 
at the same time  we are integrating more transport functionality and packet switching into our switching platforms 
to address these changes in our markets and the convergence of certain solutions portfolios  during the first quarter of fiscal  we reorganized our organizational structure and the management of our business into the following new operating segments i converged packet optical  ii packet networking  iii optical transport  and iv software and services 
notably  our converged packet optical segment consists of our former packet optical switching segment with the addition of our packet optical platform 
we have recast segment revenue and segment profit for fiscal and fiscal presented in this form k to reflect the new operating segments 
see results of operations operating segments below for additional details regarding our new operating segments effective for fiscal and the product families and platforms that make up these segments 
convertible debt exchange offer transactions 
table of contents on december   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of new convertible senior notes due the notes in separate  private transactions with holders in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes due the notes 
certain terms of the new notes are the same as the notes that they replaced  including the annual cash interest rate and the conversion rate of shares of ciena common stock per  in original principal amount  which is equal to an initial conversion price of per share 
unlike the notes  however  the principal amount of the notes will accrete at a rate of per year commencing december   compounding on a semi annual basis 
the accreted portion of the principal is payable in cash upon maturity but does not bear cash interest and is not convertible into additional ciena common stock 
consequently  in the event the notes are converted  the accreted liability will extinguish without payment 
accretion of principal is reflected as a non cash component of interest expense during the term of the notes 
the notes also provide us with the option  at our election  to convert the notes in whole or in part  prior to maturity  into the underlying common stock  provided the trading price of our common stock exceeds or of the then applicable conversion price for the required measurement period 
if we elect to convert the notes on or before maturity  holders would receive a make whole premium payable in ciena common stock  or its cash equivalent  at our election 
the notes will mature on december  following these private exchange offer transactions  million in aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding with terms unchanged 
we believe that the extension of maturity enabled by these exchange transactions has strengthened our balance sheet and provided enhanced financial flexibility 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for a summary of the notes  including an explanation of the million loss on the extinguishment of a portion of the notes and the separate accounting for the debt and equity components of the notes

fiscal compared to fiscal revenue the table below in thousands  except percentage data sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated 
table of contents fiscal year increase decrease revenue converged packet optical packet networking optical transport software and services consolidated revenue denotes of total revenue denotes change from to converged packet optical revenue increased significantly  reflecting a million increase in sales of our packet optical platform  largely driven by service provider demand for high capacity  optical transport for coherent g and g network infrastructures 
in addition  sales of our reconfigurable switching system and the otn configuration for the reconfigurable switching system increased by million and million respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales of our coredirector multiservice optical switches 
the strong performance of this segment  particularly as compared to the expected annual revenue declines in optical transport segment revenue  reflects the preference of network operators to adopt next generation architectures that enable the convergence of high capacity  coherent optical transport with integrated otn switching and control plane functionality 
packet networking revenue increased  reflecting a million increase in sales of our and families of service delivery and aggregation switches 
this increase was slightly offset by a million decrease in sales of our service aggregation switch and a million decrease in sales of our older stand alone broadband products 
segment revenue benefited from the expansion of ethernet business services by our north american service provider customers and sales of service delivery and aggregation products in support of their related network initiatives 
optical transport revenue decreased  reflecting sales decreases of million in our advanced services platform  million in other stand alone transport products and million in our advanced services platform 
revenue for our optical transport segment  which currently consists principally of stand alone wdm and sonet sdh based transport platforms  has experienced meaningful declines in annual revenue in recent years  reflecting network operators transition toward next generation network architectures as described above 
software and services revenue increased  reflecting sales increases of million in software  million in installation and deployment  million in maintenance and support services and million in network transformation consulting services 
revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states is reflected as international in the geographic distribution of revenue below

table of contents million decrease in optical transport sales 
increased revenues reflect early adoption by network operators in the united states of converged network architectures that align well with our op n architecture and solutions offering 
international revenue reflects increases of million in converged packet optical sales and million increase in software and services revenue 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in optical transport sales and million in packet networking sales 
a sizable portion of our revenue continues to come from sales to a relatively small number of service providers 
as a result  our financial results are significantly affected by and can fluctuate depending upon spending levels and the business opportunities and challenges encountered by our service provider customers 
some of our customers have indicated a procurement strategy to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase equipment  which could further affect our concentration of revenue where we participate in these efforts 
sales to at t were million  or of total revenue  in fiscal and million  or of total revenue  in fiscal we did not have any other customers accounting for greater than of our revenue in fiscal or fiscal cost of goods sold and gross profit product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  component costs  employee related costs and overhead  shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing related operations  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  amortization of intangible assets  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third party costs  including employee related costs  associated with our provision of services including installation  deployment  maintenance support  consulting and training activities  and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
our gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  is susceptible to fluctuations due to a number of factors 
in any given period  gross margin can vary significantly depending upon the mix and concentration of revenue by segment  product line within a particular segment  geography  and customers 
gross margin can also be affected by our concentration of lower margin common equipment sales and higher margin channel cards  the mix of lower margin installation services within our service revenue  our introduction of new products  and changes in expense for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty obligations 
we expect that gross margins will be subject to fluctuation based on our level of success in driving product cost reductions  rationalizing our supply chain and consolidating third party contract manufacturers and distribution sites as part of our effort to optimize our operations 
gross margin can also be adversely affected by the level of pricing pressure and competition that we encounter in the market 
in an effort to retain or secure customers  enter new markets or capture market share  we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that result in lower or negative gross margins on a particular order or group of orders 
these market dynamics and factors may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations in certain periods 
service gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services  particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services  geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business

revenue for our optical transport segment  which currently consists principally of stand alone wdm and sonet sdh based transport platforms  has experienced meaningful declines in annual revenue in recent years  reflecting network operators transition toward next generation network architectures as described above 
software and services segment profit increased primarily due to increased sales volume and decreased research and development expense  partially offset by a higher concentration of revenue from lower margin installation and deployment services for international solutions based projects 
liquidity and capital resources at october   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and long term investments in marketable debt securities  representing us treasuries and commercial paper

see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report for a summary of the material terms and conditions of this credit facility 
we principally use the credit facility to support the issuance of letters of credit that arise in the ordinary course of our business and thereby to reduce our use of cash required to collateralize these instruments 
as of october   letters of credit totaling million were collateralized by the credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of october  we regularly evaluate our liquidity position  debt obligations  and anticipated cash needs to fund our operating plans and may consider capital raising and other market opportunities that may be available to us 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next months

deferred revenue deferred revenue increased by million during fiscal product deferred revenue represents either payments received in advance of shipment or payments received in advance of revenue recognition 
services deferred revenue is related to payment for service contracts that will be recognized over the contract term 
the following table reflects in thousands the balance of deferred revenue and the change in this balance from the end of fiscal through the end of fiscal 
table of contents october  increase decrease products services total deferred revenue contractual obligations during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the debt exchange transactions described above and issued new convertible senior notes  due december  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into an extension of the term of ciena s lease of the lab building on the former nortel carling campus in ottawa  canada 
the following is a summary of our future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of october  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter principal due at maturity on convertible notes interest due on convertible notes operating leases purchase obligations capital lease other obligations total includes the accretion of the principal amount on the notes payable at maturity at a rate of per year compounded semi annually  commencing december  does not include variable insurance  taxes  maintenance and other costs required by the applicable operating lease 
these costs are not expected to have a material future impact 
purchase obligations relate to purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory 
in certain instances  we are permitted to cancel  reschedule or adjust these orders 
consequently  only a portion of the amount reported above relates to firm  non cancelable and unconditional obligations 
as of october   we also had approximately million of other long term obligations in our consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions that are not included in this table because the timing or amount of any cash settlement with the respective tax authority cannot be reasonably estimated 
some of our commercial commitments  including some of the future minimum payments in operating leases set forth above and certain commitments to customers  are secured by standby letters of credit collateralized under our credit facility or restricted cash 
restricted cash balances are included in other current assets or other long term assets depending upon the duration of the underlying letter of credit obligation 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment expiration date as of october  in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any equity interests in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities spes and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their 
table of contents nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  derivatives and hedging  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery or services rendered 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer payment history 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in revenue  with the associated expenses included in product cost of goods sold 
we apply the percentage of completion method to long term arrangements where it is required to undertake significant production  customizations or modification engineering  and reasonable and reliable estimates of revenue and cost are available 
utilizing the percentage of completion method  we recognize revenue based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred 
in instances that do not meet the percentage of completion method criteria  recognition of revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
unbilled percentage of completion revenues recognized are accumulated in the contracts in progress account included in accounts receivable  net 
billings in excess of revenues recognized to date on these contracts are recorded within deferred revenue 
software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in instances where final acceptance criteria of the software is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
revenue for multiple element arrangements is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each delivered element  with revenue recognized for each delivered element when the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable based upon the selling price hierarchy for multiple deliverable arrangements 
under this hierarchy  we use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price besp for that deliverable 
vsoe  when determinable  is established based on our pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining whether vsoe exists  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we have generally been unable to establish tpe of selling price because our go to market strategy differs from that of others in our markets  and the extent of customization and differentiated features and functions varies among comparable products or services from our peers 
we determine besp based upon management approved pricing guidelines  which consider multiple factors including the type of product or service  gross margin objectives  competitive and market conditions  and the go to market strategy  all of which can affect pricing practices 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 

table of contents share based compensation we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting  or acceleration of vesting 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  using graded vesting  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measurement of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of october   total unrecognized compensation expense was million  which relates to unvested restricted stock units and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock units directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law with and without method 
under the with and without method  the windfall is considered realized and recognized for financial statement purposes only when an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax benefits including our net operating losses 
the with and without method results in the windfall from share based compensation awards always being effectively the last tax benefit to be considered 
consequently  the windfall attributable to share based compensation will not be considered realized in instances where our net operating loss carryover that is unrelated to windfalls is sufficient to offset the current year taxable income before considering the effects of current year windfalls 
reserve for inventory obsolescence we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
upon recognition of the write down  a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines 
in addition  part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines 
each of these practices exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
historically  we have experienced write downs due to changes in our strategic direction  discontinuance of a product and declines in market conditions 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the charges in fiscal and fiscal primarily related to engineering design changes and the discontinuance of certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our optical transport and converged packet optical products 
our inventory net of allowance for excess and obsolescence was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on management assessment  on a specific identification basis  of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally have not 
table of contents required collateral or other forms of security from customers 
in determining the appropriate balance for our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine collectibility 
in doing so  we consider creditworthiness  payment history  account activity and communication with such customer 
if a customer financial condition changes  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
long lived assets our long lived assets include equipment  furniture and fixtures  finite lived intangible assets and maintenance spares 
as of october  and october  these assets totaled million and million  net  respectively 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
our long lived assets are assigned to asset groups which represent the lowest level for which we identify cash flows 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting nearly all our net deferred tax assets of billion 
when measuring the need for a valuation allowance  we assess both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent three year period is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our cumulative loss during this three year period represents sufficient negative evidence regarding the need for nearly a full valuation allowance 
we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
any future release of valuation allowance may be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income or as an adjustment to paid in capital  based on tax ordering requirements 
warranty our liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
the provision for product warranties was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
the provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of products and customers in that period 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
an increase in warranty claims or the related costs associated with satisfying our warranty obligations could increase our cost of sales and negatively affect our gross margin 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
unaudited quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  this information is unaudited  but in our opinion reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we currently hold investments in us government obligations with varying maturities 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for information relating to investments and fair value 
these investments are sensitive to interest rate movements and their fair value will decline as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates decline 
the estimated impact on these investments of a basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve from rates in effect as of the balance sheet date would be a million decline in value 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  our business and results of operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to our global presence  some of our revenue is non us dollar denominated with canadian dollars and euros being our most significant foreign currency revenue streams 
if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  our revenues reported in us dollars would decline 
for our us dollar denominated sales  an increase in the value of the us dollar would increase the real cost to our customers of our products in markets outside the united states  which could impact our competitive position 
with regard to operating expense  our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in canadian dollars  british pounds  euros and indian rupees 
during fiscal  approximately of our operating expense was non us dollar denominated 
if these currencies strengthen  costs reported in us dollars will increase 
during fiscal  research and development expense benefited from approximately million  net of hedging  due to the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the indian rupee and the canadian dollar in comparison to fiscal from time to time  ciena uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce variability in certain forecasted non us dollar denominated cash flows 
generally  these derivatives have maturities of months or less and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at the inception of the cash flow hedge  and on an ongoing basis  ciena assesses whether the forward contract has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the hedging period 
the effective portion of the derivative net gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and  upon the occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified to the line item in the consolidated statement of operations to which the hedged transaction relates 
any net gain or loss associated with the ineffectiveness of the hedging instrument is reported in interest and other income loss  net 
from time to time  ciena also uses foreign currency forwards to hedge certain balance sheet exposures 
these forwards are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and any net gain or loss associated with these derivatives is reported in interest and other income  net 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
convertible notes outstanding 
the fair market value of each of our outstanding issues of convertible notes is subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the convertible feature of the notes and other factors 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes may also increase as the market price of our stock rises and decrease as the market price of the stock falls 
interest rate and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes and may affect the prices at which we would be able to repurchase such notes were we to do so 
these changes do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
for additional information on the fair value of our outstanding notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report
