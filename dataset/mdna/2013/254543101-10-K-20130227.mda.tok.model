summary of the year ended december  net sales for was million  compared to million in  gross profit for was million  or of net sales  a decrease of from the million  or of net sales  in  net income attributable to common stockholders for was million  or per diluted share  a decrease of from the million  or per diluted share  in  cash flow from operations for was million  an increase of from the million in  and announced three acquisitions as part of our strategy to purse selective strategic acquisitions 
overview of late in the first quarter of  we began to see signs of a recovery in our end markets 
we took advantage of this renewed strength by significantly reducing our lower margin finished goods inventory  which helped to support revenue and secure incremental market share gains 
as a result  we achieved moderate sequential revenue growth  which was significantly better than the typical seasonal slowness 
however  our decision to reduce inventory combined with increased pricing pressure and lower utilization  continued to impact margins during the quarter 
we believed that the first quarter represented the low point in the cycle and that overall demand was beginning to improve across all of our geographies 
as such  we shifted our strategy back to our growth model to aggressively capture additional market share 
we begun adding capacity for new  more advanced packaging at our shanghai facilities to support our anticipated growth 
as the demand and pricing environment improves further  we will transition available capacity to higher margin products to enhance our product mix and margins going forward 
during the second quarter of  we had sequential growth in net sales driven by improved demand across all of our geographies and end markets as we continued to gain market share 
the second quarter benefited from the ramping of new projects for our products used in smartphones and tablets  where we are very well positioned 
our growth was particularly noteworthy considering our stronger than seasonal results in the first quarter  which traditionally is the low point in the demand cycle 
margins also improved in the second quarter as we began to slowly shift to higher margin products  while also benefiting from new product initiatives and manufacturing efficiency improvements 
in addition  we have made targeted capital expenditures in our shanghai facilities to increase capacity for specific packages and products 
despite the slowdown in the general market during the third quarter of  we were able to achieve sequential growth and meet our expectations due to past design wins and new product initiatives that drove further market share gains 
the third quarter was our third consecutive quarter of growth as we continued to increase sales for our products used in smartphones and tablets  while also benefiting from a rebound in led tvs and a strong quarter in automotive 
gross margin improved moderately in the third quarter but remained under pressure primarily due to the effects of the generally weak global economy 
although we were gaining market share for our more advanced packages as supported by the capital investments we made in the second and third quarters  we were still underloaded on our standard packages 
the unstable demand environment also caused pricing to weaken in the third quarter and product mix to be less favorable than we had anticipated 
however  our cost reductions and manufacturing efficiency improvements were able to largely offset these factors and contributed to margins improving slightly over the prior quarter 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  revenue grew over the fourth quarter of as we continued to gain momentum for our products used in smartphones and tablets 
our new product initiatives and increasing customer content remained key drivers of our market share gains throughout the year 
despite gold prices being up approximately and the loading down from third quarter to fourth quarter  margins improved due mainly to additional copper wire conversion and  productivity improvements  coupled with a small mix improvement 
also during the quarter  we began integrating our two recent acquisitions and announced a third proposed acquisition 
business acquisitions eris technology corporation on august   we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of eris technology corporation eris and consolidated eris beginning september  the purpose of obtaining a controlling interest in eris was to expand our semiconductor product offerings and to maximize our market opportunities 
in addition  our main interest in eris is for its automatic manufacturing capabilities in test and assembly for various diode products 
the business scope for eris comprises schottky diodes  tvs diodes  zener diodes  bridge diodes  wafers  leds and the relevant devices 
power analog microelectronics  inc on october   the company acquired power analog microelectronics  inc pam 
pam is a provider of advanced analog and high voltage power ics  and its product portfolio includes class d audio amplifiers  dc dc converters and led backlighting drivers 
pam was founded in silicon valley in and has technical and business centers in shanghai  shenzhen  taipei and tokyo 
we acquired pam to strengthen our position as a global provider of high quality analog products by expanding diodes product portfolio with innovative filter less digital audio amplifiers  application specific power management ics  as well as high performance led drivers and dc dc converters 
bcd semiconductor manufacturing limited on december   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with bcd semiconductor manufacturing limited bcd 
the acquisition is expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of we expect this acquisition to enhance our analog product portfolio by expanding our standard linear and power management offerings  including ac dc and dc dc solutions for power adapters and chargers  as well as other electronics products 
bcd s established presence in asia with a particularly strong local market position in china offers us even greater penetration of the consumer  computing and communications markets 
likewise  we believe we can achieve increased market penetration for bcd s products by leveraging our global customer base and sales channels 
in addition  bcd has in house manufacturing capabilities in china  as well as a cost effective development team that can be deployed across multiple product families 
we also believe we will be able to apply our packaging capabilities and expertise to bcd s products in order to improve cost efficiencies  utilization as well as product mix 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report for additional information about eris  pam and bcd 
business outlook for  we look to combine synergies with our acquisitions to enhance profitability and growth opportunities with our global customer base and sales channels  especially in china 
we expect our business to continue to benefit from increasing demand in china  as we consider the china market a major growth driver for our business 
we expect revenue for the first quarter of to be slightly better than the normal seasonal pattern  although the first quarter is typically a seasonally down quarter 
the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve 
we believe the long term outlook for our business remains generally favorable despite the recent volatility in the global economy and the equity and credit markets as we continue to execute on the strategy that has proven successful for us over the years 
see risk factors the success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and financial condition

capital expenditures  excluding capital expenditures related to the investment agreement  for were approximately of our net sales  which was lower than our historical to of net sales model as we delayed capital investments in the third and fourth quarters in response to market conditions 

table of contents during  we announced an investment agreement with the management committee of the cdht 
under this agreement  we have agreed to form a joint venture with a chinese partner  chengdu ya guang electronic company limited  to establish a semiconductor manufacturing facility for surface mounted component production  assembly and test in chengdu  china 
we initially will own at least of the joint venture 
the manufacturing facility will be developed in phases over a ten year period  and in order to qualify for certain financial incentives  we were obligated to contribute at least million to the joint venture in installments by december  due to pending approval from the chinese government for completion of the restructuring of our china corporate entities  we received an extension to contribute the required amount until december  the cdht will grant the joint venture a fifty year land lease  provides temporary facilities for up to three years at a subsidized rent while the joint venture builds the manufacturing facility and provides corporate and employee tax incentives  tax refunds  subsidies and other financial support to the joint venture and its qualified employees

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when product is shipped to the customers 
generally  we recognize revenue upon shipment to manufacturers direct ship as well as upon sales to distributors using the sell in model  which is when product is shipped to the distributors point of purchase 
certain customers have limited rights of return and or are entitled to price adjustments on products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers 
we reduce net sales in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of sales  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to net sales 
we record allowances reserves for the following items i ship and debit  which arise when we  from time to time based on market conditions  issue credit to certain distributors upon their shipments to their end customers  ii stock rotation  which are contractual obligations that permit certain distributors  twice a year  to return a portion of their inventory based on historical shipments to them in exchange for an equal and offsetting order  and iii price protection  which arise when market conditions cause average selling prices to decrease and we issue credit to certain distributors on their inventory 
ship and debit reserves are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable 
stock rotation reserves are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned 
price protection reserves are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding increase in accrued liabilities 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value  we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized 
this analysis requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination  using the presumption the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 

table of contents goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis  on october  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
for and  we used the simplified goodwill impairment test  which allows us to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one of the two step annual goodwill impairment test 
we are required to perform step one and calculate the fair value of its reporting units only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value that is  a likelihood of more than 
the qualitative analysis  which we refer to as step zero  was performed and we considered all relevant factors specific to its reporting units 
some factors considered in step zero were macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  events affecting a reporting unit and other relevant entity specific events 
our conclusion of step zero was that goodwill is deemed to be not impaired and no further testing is required until the next annual test date or sooner if conditions or events before that date raise concerns of potential impairment in the business 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented 
share based compensation we use the black scholes merton model to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the black scholes merton model requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including the grant price  the expected future volatility  the expected term of the option and the risk free interest rate of the option 
the expected term and expected future volatility of the options require our judgment 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock options expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  share based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
restricted stock grants are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
fair value measurements fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an assets or liability 
fair value is based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques  which is determined on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
these two types of inputs create a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
our defined benefit plan assets are valued under methods of fair value 
all of the securities held by the plan are publicly traded and highly liquid 
therefore  the majority of the securities are valued under level and one security is valued under level using quoted prices for identical or similar securities 
defined benefit plan we maintain a pension plan covering certain of our employees in the uk for financial reporting purposes  the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic pension costs are calculated based upon  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate for plan obligations  estimated return on pension plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 
see fair value measurements above in regard to pension plan assets 
contingencies from time to time  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information available  we evaluate the likelihood of potential outcomes 
we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we do not accrue for estimated legal fees and other directly related costs as they are expensed as incurred

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia and europe 
our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have a material adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar and the british pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
in the future  we may enter into hedging arrangements designed to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations 
see risk factors we are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations 
in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
effect on reporting income certain of our subsidiaries have a functional currency that differs from the currencies in which some of their expenses are denominated 
our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  our results of operations are reported in us dollars  which is our reporting currency 
in the event the us dollar weakens against a foreign currency  we will experience a currency transaction loss  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if a foreign currency were to weaken or strengthen by against the us dollar  we would experience currency transaction gain or loss of less than million per quarter 
foreign currency transaction risk we also are subject to foreign currency risk arising from intercompany transactions that are expected to be settled in cash in the near term where the cash balances are held in denominations other than our subsidiaries functional currency 
if exchange rates weaken against the functional currency  we would incur a remeasurement gain in the value of the cash balances  and if the exchange rates strengthen against the functional currency  we would incur a remeasurement loss in the value of the cash balances  assuming the net monetary asset balances remained constant 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of transaction  the size and currencies of the net monetary assets and the changes in the exchange rates associated with these currencies 
if the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling were to weaken or strengthen by against the us dollar  we would experience currency transaction gain or loss of less than million 
net foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in other income and expense 
foreign currency translation risk when our foreign subsidiaries books are maintained in their functional currency  fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into us dollars for reporting purposes 
all elements of the subsidiaries financial statements  except for stockholders equity accounts  are translated using a currency exchange rate 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
income and expense accounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period presented 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets  which are accumulated in this account until sale or liquidation of the foreign entity investment  at which time they are reported as adjustments to the gain or loss on sale of investment 
foreign currency denominated defined benefit plans we have a contributory defined benefit plan that covers certain employees in the uk  which is closed to new entrants and frozen with respect to future benefit accruals 
the retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee 
december is our annual measurement date and on measurement date  defined benefit plan assets are determined based on fair value 
defined benefit plan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability 
the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic costs are based on  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 

table of contents as of december   the plan was underfunded and a liability of approximately million was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a noncurrent liability 
the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was a net loss of million 
if the british pound sterling were to weaken or strengthen by against the us dollar  we would experience currency translation liability decrease or increase of less than million 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used to determine benefit obligations as of december  was 
a increase decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the net period benefit cost for the year would reduce annual benefit cost by less than million 
a increase decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the year end projected benefit obligation would increase decrease the year end projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various assets classes and as such  each increase decrease in the expected rate of return assumption would increase decrease the net period benefit cost by approximately million 
the asset value of the defined benefit plan has been volatile in recent years due primarily to wide fluctuations in the uk equity markets and bond markets 
see risk factors due to the recent fluctuations in the united kingdom s equity markets and bond markets  changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan s asset value  require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
interest rate risk we have credit facilities with financial institutions in the us  asia and europe as well as other debt instruments with interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense 
as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
as of december   our outstanding principal debt included our million term loan  lines of credit of million and million used for import and export guarantees 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates by for the year on our credit facilities  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by less than million 
in addition  on january   we entered into a five year million revolving senior credit facility  which will further increase our sensitivity to raising interest rates  depending on how much we draw down on the facility 
political risk we have a significant portion of our assets in mainland china  taiwan and the uk the possibility of political conflict between the any of these countries or with the us could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to transact business through these important business channels and to generate profits 
see risk factors risks related to our international operations in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
inflation risk inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal year a significant increase in inflation could affect future performance 
credit risk the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  which in turn affect our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve 
we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations  while at times providing extended terms 
we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by dispersion of our customers over various geographic areas  operating primarily in electronics manufacturing and distribution 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks
