we have five operating segments 
the table below sets forth the relative contribution of these operating segments to our consolidated operating revenues years ended december  segment operating revenue residential real estate commerical real estate resorts  leisure and leasing operations forestry rural land other consolidated operating revenues for  we changed our segment presentation to include resorts  leisure and leasing operations as a reportable operating segment because this business currently meets the qualitative and quantitative factors as a reportable operating segment 

table of contents this segment includes our resorts and clubs business  which was previously presented in the residential real estate segment 
it also includes our leasing operations  which were previously presented in both our residential real estate and commercial real estate segments 
we have combined the leasing operations with resorts and leisure because they are all reported as recurring revenue streams 
all prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the presentation 
the change in reportable operating segments has no effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented 
residential real estate our residential real estate segment typically plans and develops mixed use resort  primary and seasonal residential communities of various sizes  primarily on our existing land 
we own large tracts of land in northwest florida  including significant gulf of mexico beach frontage and waterfront properties  and land in and around jacksonville and tallahassee 
our residential real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed homesites  the sale of parcels of entitled  undeveloped lots  the lot residual that provides us a percentage of the sale price of the completed home if the home price exceeds a negotiated threshold  and fees on certain transactions 
our residential real estate segment incurs cost of revenues from costs directly associated with the land  development and construction of real estate sold  indirect costs such as development overhead  project administration  warranty  and selling costs  and brokerage fees 
commercial real estate in our commercial real estate segment we plan  develop and entitle our land holdings  often in conjunction with strategic partners  for a broad range of retail  office  hotel  industrial and multi family uses 
we sell land for commercial and light industrial uses within large and small scale commerce parks  as well as for multi family rental projects 
our commercial real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed and undeveloped land for retail  multi family  office  hotel and industrial uses and from the sale of undeveloped land or land with limited development  and easements 
our commercial real estate segment incurs costs of revenues from costs directly associated with the land  development costs and selling costs 
resorts  leisure and leasing operations our resorts  leisure and leasing operations segment generates revenues from our recurring revenue streams  which primarily include the watercolor inn and vacation rentals  golf courses  marinas and leasing operations 
watercolor inn and vacation rentals our resorts  leisure and leasing operations segment generates revenues from the watercolor inn and resort  an award winning boutique hotel  the watersound beach club and our vacation rentals 
the watercolor inn incurs costs from the cost of services and goods provided  personnel costs and third party management fees 
our vacation rental business generates revenues from the rental of private homes to families vacationing in the area 
the vacation rental business incurs costs from marketing  personnel and general maintenance for the homeowner 
golf courses our golf courses generate revenues from memberships and daily play and incurs costs from the services provided  maintenance of the golf course facilities and personnel costs and third party management fees 
table of contents marinas our marinas generate revenues from boat slip rentals and incidentals such as fuel and ice  and incur costs from cost of services provided  maintenance of the marina facilities  and personnel costs 
leasing operations our leasing operations generate revenues from leasing retail and commercial property and incurs costs primarily from maintenance of the properties and personnel costs 
rural land our rural land segment markets and sells tracts of land of varying sizes for rural recreational  conservation and timberland uses 
our rural land segments prepares land for sale for these uses through harvesting  thinning and other siviculture practices  and in some cases  limited infrastructure development 
our rural land segment generates revenues from the sale of undeveloped land  land with limited development and easements 
our rural land segment incurs costs of revenue from the cost of land  minimal development costs and selling costs 
forestry our forestry segment focuses on the management and harvesting of our extensive timber holdings 
we grow  harvest and sell sawtimber  wood fiber and forest products and provide land management services for conservation properties 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of wood fiber  sawtimber  standing timber and forest products and conservation land management services 
our forestry segment incurs costs of revenues from internal costs of forestry management  external logging costs  and property taxes 
a significant portion of the revenue from our forestry segment is generated pursuant to our supply agreement entered into in november with rocktenn rocktenn supply agreement  under which we sell delivered wood trees that we cut and deliver 
under the terms of our prior supply agreement with smurfit stone container corporation smurfit stone  the price for timber both stumpage and delivered wood was based on the average price of stumpage set forth in an established index 
as stumpage is priced lower than delivered wood  the one index formula underpriced our delivered wood 
under the rocktenn supply agreement  the price for timber is based upon the average of the market price for stumpage and the market price for delivered wood  each as set forth in an established index 
in addition  pursuant to the rocktenn supply agreement  smurfit stone and rocktenn would be liable for any monetary damages as a result of the closure of the mill due to economic reasons for a period of one year 
nevertheless  if the rocktenn mill in panama city  florida  were to permanently cease operations  the price for pulpwood may decline  and the cost of delivering logs to alternative customers would increase 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical and current experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized during the development period 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and 
table of contents construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest up to total interest expense based on the amount of underlying expenditures and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period in which the determination is made 
real estate inventory costs also include land and common development costs such as roads  sewers and amenities  multi family construction costs  capitalized property taxes  capitalized interest and certain indirect costs 
a portion of real estate inventory costs and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually and more frequently if warranted by market conditions or other factors  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 
the capitalization period relating to direct and indirect project costs is the period in which activities necessary to ready a property for its intended use are in progress 
the period begins when such activities commence  typically when the company begins the entitlement processes for land already owned  and ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use requires judgment 
the company determines when the capitalization period begins and ends through communication with project and other managers responsible for the tracking and oversight of individual projects 
in the event that the activities to ready the asset for its intended use are suspended  the capitalization period will cease until such activities are resumed 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period in which the determination is made and recovery is not deemed reasonable 
our investments in real estate are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine that an impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
if such assets were held for sale  the provision for loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value less costs to sell 
we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i analyzing expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
fair value of a property may be derived either from discounting projected cash flows at an appropriate discount rate to  through appraisals of the underlying property  or a combination thereof 
our new real estate investment strategy is focused on reducing future capital outlays and employing a risk adjusted investment return criteria for evaluating our properties and future investments in such properties 
pursuant to this new strategy  we intend to significantly reduce planned future capital expenditures for infrastructure  amenities and master planned community development and reposition certain assets to encourage increased absorption of such properties in their respective markets 
as part of this repositioning  we expect properties may be sold in bulk  in undeveloped or developed parcels  or at lower price points and over shorter time periods 
the accounting estimate related to real estate impairment evaluation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and future expenditures 
for projects under development  an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is performed using estimated future expenditures necessary to maintain the existing project and using management s best estimates about future sales prices and planned holding periods 
based on the company s risk adjusted investment return criteria for evaluating the company s projects under development or undeveloped  management s assumptions used in the projection of undiscounted cash flows included the projected pace of sales of homesites based on estimated market conditions and the company s development plans  estimated pricing and projected price appreciation over time  which can range from to annually  
table of contents the amount and trajectory of price appreciation over the estimate selling period  the length of the estimated development and selling periods  which can differ depending on the size of the development and the number of phases to be developed  the amount of remaining development costs  including the extent of infrastructure or amenities included in such development costs  holding costs to be incurred over the selling period  for bulk land sales of undeveloped and developed parcels future pricing is based upon estimated developed lot pricing less estimated development costs and estimated developer profit at  for commercial development property  future pricing is based on sales of comparable property in similar markets  and assumptions regarding the intent and ability to hold individual investments in real estate over projected periods and related assumptions regarding available liquidity to fund continued development 
for operating properties  an estimate of undiscounted cash flows requires management to make similar assumptions about the use and eventual disposition of such properties 
some of the significant assumptions that are used to develop the undiscounted cash flows include for investments in inns and rental condominium units  average occupancy and room rates  revenues from food and beverage and other amenity operations  operating expenses and capital expenditures  and eventual disposition of such properties as private residence vacation units or condominiums  based on current prices for similar units appreciated to the expected sale date  for investments in commercial or retail property  future occupancy and rental rates and the amount of proceeds to be realized upon eventual disposition of such property at a terminal capitalization rate  and  for investments in golf courses  future rounds and greens fees  operating expenses and capital expenditures  and the amount of proceeds to be realized upon eventual disposition of such properties at a multiple of terminal year cash flows 
other properties that management does not intend to sell in the near term under current market conditions and has the ability to hold are evaluated for impairment based on management s best estimate of the long term use and eventual disposition of the property 
the results of impairment analyses for development and operating properties are particularly dependent on the estimated holding and selling period for each asset group 
as a result of our adoption of our risk adjusted investment return criteria  these future holding periods were reduced to a maximum period of years in january as we have new projects or developments we will use specific holding periods for these new projects  which may include longer holding periods 
retained interest investments 
we have recorded retained interest with respect to the monetization of certain installment notes through the use of qualified special purpose entities  which is recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
at the time of monetization the initial retained interest recorded was an estimate based on the present value of future excess cash flows expected to be received over the life of the notes  using management s best estimate of underlying assumptions  including credit risk and discount rates 
we recognize investment income over the life of the retained interest using the effective yield method with rates ranging from based on expected future cash flows 
we continue to update the expectation of cash flows to be collected over the life of the retained interest 
changes to the previously projected cash flows are accounted for prospectively  unless based on management s assessment of current information and events  it is determined that there is an other than temporary impairment 
we have not recorded an other than temporary impairment related to our retained interest investment in  and 
table of contents standby guarantee liability 
in october  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with southwest airlines to facilitate the commencement of low fare air service in may to the new northwest florida beaches international airport in northwest florida 
we agreed to reimburse southwest airlines if it incurs losses on its service at the new airport during the first three years of service 
the agreement also provides that southwest s profits from the air service during the term of the agreement will be shared with us up to the maximum amount of our break even payments 
we measured the standby guarantee liability at fair value based upon a discounted cash flow analysis based on our best estimates of future cash flows to be paid by us pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement 
these cash flows were estimated using numerous estimates including future fuel costs  passenger load factors  air fares  seasonality and the timing of the commencement of service 
effective july   the company and southwest airlines mutually agreed to terminate this agreement 
in conjunction with the termination of this agreement  in  we recorded million of other income as a result of eliminating a liability recorded at the inception of the agreement 
no payments were due to southwest airlines at the effective date of termination 
pension plan 
we sponsor a cash balance defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension plan s impact on the financial statements of the company 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income 
a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an equivalent decrease in pre tax income 
a increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in a less than million change in pre tax income 
at december   our pension plan was in a net overfunded position of million and the ratio of plan assets to projected benefit obligation was 
in  our compensation committee approved a plan to terminate our pension plan in march at that time  the plan will be frozen until such time that we have received all the regulatory approvals for termination 
as a result of this action  we recognized a loss in of million 
in addition  we currently expect to recognize further estimated losses of approximately million to million  and receive approximately million to million of cash once we receive all the regulatory approvals and distributions are made to plan participants and excise taxes are paid 
stock based compensation 
we have previously offered stock incentive plans whereby awards were granted to certain employees and non employee directors in the form of restricted shares of our common stock or options to purchase our common stock 
in  less than million of vested restricted stock awards were granted 
in addition  in february  and  we granted select executives and other key employees restricted stock awards with vesting based upon the achievement of certain market conditions that are defined as our total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of certain peer groups during a three year performance period 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is typically recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock  we will issue new common stock 
all stock options and the majority of our restricted share awards have vested and the related stock based compensation has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements in prior years 
we currently have less than million of unamortized expense related to restricted share awards that will be recognized in the first quarter of when these awards vest 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 

table of contents we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our analysis of the timing and reversal of future taxable amounts and our history and future expectations of taxable income 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period we will include the adjustments in the tax provision in our financial statements 
at december  and  the company had a federal net operating loss of approximately million and million  respectively  and a state net operating loss carry forward of million and million  respectively 
these net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income through in general  a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain a benefit from the reversal of deductible temporary differences and from loss carryforwards 
based on the timing of reversal of future taxable amounts and the company s recent history of losses and future expectations of reporting taxable losses  management does not believe it met the requirements to realize the benefits of certain of its deferred tax assets and has provided for a valuation allowance of million and million at december  and  respectively 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income on january   we adopted an accounting standards update asu that require an entity to present either a single statement of comprehensive income or loss or a separate statement of comprehensive income or loss that immediately follows a statement of income or loss 
a single statement of comprehensive income or loss is comprised of a statement of income or loss with other comprehensive income and losses  total other comprehensive income or loss  and total comprehensive income or loss appended 
a separate statement of comprehensive income or loss is comprised of net income or loss  other comprehensive income and losses  total other comprehensive income or loss  and total comprehensive income or loss 
furthermore  the asu prohibit an entity from presenting other comprehensive income and losses in a statement of equity only 
the adoption of the asu resulted in the addition of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
amendments to fair value measurement requirements on january   we adopted an asu that requires additional fair value measurement disclosures 
for fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs  quantitative disclosures of the inputs and qualitative disclosures of the valuation processes are required 
for items not measured at fair value in the balance sheet but whose fair value is disclosed  disclosures of the fair value hierarchy level  the fair value measurement techniques used  and the inputs used in the fair value measurements are required 
in addition  the asu permits an entity to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial instruments based on the portfolio s net position  if the portfolio has met certain criteria 
furthermore  the asu refines when an entity should  and should not  apply certain premiums and discounts to a fair value measurement 
the adoption of the asu is reflected in note  fair value measurements and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in return we were released from a twenty eight year land lease that will save us a total of approximately million in lease payments and agreed to assume certain costs associated with the land 
during  we recorded significant impairment charges primarily due to our change in real estate investment strategy
