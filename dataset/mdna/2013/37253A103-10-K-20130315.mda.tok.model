item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other places in this report 
such statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  believe  estimate  anticipate  intend  continue  or similar terms  variations of such terms or the negative of such terms 
such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
factors that could cause such results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements include those set forth below 
risks relating to our business the automotive industry  which represents our primary market  may decline causing our product revenues to decline demand for our products is directly related to automotive vehicle production 
in and  automotive sales and production were significantly and adversely affected by general economic and industry conditions  labor relations issues  fuel prices  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
although general automotive sales have improved in the past few years  there remains significant uncertainty in the automotive industry 
declines in automotive production levels  particularly with respect to models for which we supply products  would materially reduce our revenues and harm our profitability 
we may not be able to commercialize and market additional products to other industries we are currently developing products to be used in a wide range of industries 
for example  we are expecting increased sales of our ted products to industries such as bed manufacturers and increased sales of wet s heated and ventilated products for such applications as ski lifts and sports stadiums 
however  such non automotive applications only represent a small portion of our total revenues 
furthermore  although we have made significant improvements in ted technology and we believe that a number of new products have become practical at our current stage of ted advancement  additional improvements are necessary to make ted based products commercially attractive in comparison with other technologies for the major markets in which we are targeting 
these advancements are dependent on many variables including but not limited to new advanced materials becoming available and efficient and cost effective manufacturing processes for advanced teds and the related materials being developed 
there is no certainty that any advancement in teds will be commercially viable or that we will be successful in generating significant revenues from non automotive sales of any of our products 

table of contents we may not generate enough liquid assets to fund our ongoing operations we have funded our financial needs from inception primarily through net proceeds received through our initial public offering as well as other equity and debt financing 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  based on our current operating plan  we believe our cash on hand along with the proceeds from future revenues will be sufficient to meet operating needs for the foreseeable future 
however  if our revenues decline  we will be forced to fund our operations from alternative sources  which may not always be available 
our ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our product by original equipment manufactures and consumers our automotive seat temperature control products  which generate a majority of our revenues  go through a lengthy development process before being included in a vehicle model s seat 
the process includes developing prototypes for proof of concept and then adapting the systems to actual products produced by existing seat manufactures 
while we currently have active development programs with various partners  no assurance can be given that our products will be implemented in any particular seats 
furthermore  automotive manufacturers will only include our products if there appears to be demand for temperature control seats from the ultimate purchasers of vehicles 
if vehicle purchasers conclude that temperature control seats are unnecessary or too expensive  oems and seat manufactures will not be interested in including our seat temperature control products in their vehicles 
significant increases in the market prices of certain raw materials may adversely affect our business many of our products contain teds which contain certain raw materials that cannot generally be substituted 
as an example  tellurium is a raw material used in teds 
if the market prices for these raw materials significantly increase  our gross profit may be adversely impacted as our suppliers pass those price increases on to us 
increases in the price of tellurium is one example of the impact raw material prices could have on our business 
our suppliers generally pass increases in tellurium prices on to us and our ability to recover these increases from our customers is limited 
other key raw materials include copper  silver and petroleum based engineered plastics 
our business and operations could also be materially adversely affected by shortages in key raw materials 
the disruption or loss of relationships with vendors and suppliers for the components for our products could materially adversely affect our business our ability to manufacture and market our products successfully is dependent on relationships with both third party vendors and suppliers 
we rely on various vendors and suppliers for the components of our products and procure these components through purchase orders  with no guaranteed supply arrangements 
certain components are only available from a limited number of suppliers 
the loss of any significant supplier  in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement  or an inability to obtain essential components on reasonable terms or at all  could materially adversely affect our business  operations and cash flows 
our business and operations could also be materially adversely affected by delays in deliveries from suppliers 
production of our products in foreign countries entails risks of production interruption and unexpected costs we outsource production of our ccs products to lower cost countries in order to be price competitive 
such outsourced production is currently completed by suppliers located in mexico  japan and china 
wet maintains production facilities in lower cost countries for similar cost containment reasons 
wet currently has production facilities in hungary  ukraine  china and mexico 
our use of production facilities located outside of the united states entails risk of production interruption and unexpected costs due to the uncertain nature of foreign operations and extended logistics 

table of contents automobile manufacturers  in particular  demand on time delivery of quality products  and some have required the payment of substantial financial penalties for failure to deliver components to their plants on a timely basis 
such penalties  as well as costs to avoid them  such as overtime costs and overnight air freighting of parts that normally are shipped by other less expensive means of transportation  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
moreover  the inability to meet demand for our products on a timely basis would materially adversely affect our reputation and future commercial prospects 
wet is subject to additional risks associated with its international operations that could adversely affect its results of operations 
wet has significant personnel  property  equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of its headquarters in germany  including china  hungary  mexico and the ukraine 
long term economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which wet operates could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from wet s operations to cover its capital needs and debt service 
in addition  as a result of wet s global presence  a significant portion of its revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the euro its operational currency 
wet is therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure  including to the chinese renminbi  the hungarian forint  the mexican peso  the ukrainian hryvnia and the canadian dollar 
while wet employs financial instruments to hedge transactional and foreign exchange exposure  these activities do not completely insulate wet from those exposures 
exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely impact wet s financial results  and cause losses from the hedging instruments utilized 
there are other risks that are inherent in wet s international operations  including the potential for changes in socio economic conditions  laws and regulations  including import  export  labor and environmental laws  and monetary and fiscal policies  protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures  unsettled political conditions  natural and man made disasters  hazards and losses  violence and possible terrorist attacks 
due to wet s global operations  wet is subject to many laws governing international relations  including those that restrict where it can do business and what information or products it can supply to certain countries and foreign governments 
violations of these laws  which are complex  may result in criminal penalties or sanctions 
these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on wet s international operations and therefore on our business and results of operations 
we are subject to significant currency risk associated with our investment in wet the operations of wet represent a significant portion of our consolidated business 
wet s functional currency is the euro and  as noted above  wet s global transactions are conducted in a number of different currencies 
we  in turn  are subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure  pertaining to changes in the value of the euro 
changes in the exchange rate of euros to us dollars could significantly affect our reported revenues and earnings 
we may not be able to persuade potential customers of the merits of our products and justify their costs to increase our sales because of the sophisticated nature and relatively early stage of development of our main products  we have been  and will continue to be  required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of such products justify the costs associated with such products 
we have relied on  and will continue to rely on  automobile manufacturers and manufacturers in other industries and their dealer networks to market our 
table of contents products 
the success of any such relationship will depend in part on the other party s own competitive  marketing and strategic considerations  including the relative advantages of alternative products being developed and or marketed by any such party 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to market our products successfully so as to generate meaningful product sales increases or to continue at existing sales volumes 
the sales cycle for our automotive products is lengthy and the lengthy cycle impedes growth in our sales the sales cycle in the automotive components industry is lengthy and can be as long as four years or more for products that must be designed into a vehicle  because some companies take that long to design and develop a vehicle 
even when selling parts that are neither safety critical nor highly integrated into the vehicle  there are still many stages that an automotive supply company must go through before achieving commercial sales 
the sales cycle is lengthy because an automobile manufacturer must develop a high degree of assurance that the products it buys will meet customer needs  interface as easily as possible with the other parts of a vehicle and with the automobile manufacturer s production and assembly process  and have minimal warranty  safety and service problems 
as a result  from the time that a manufacturer develops a strong interest in our products  it normally will take several years before our products are available to consumers in that manufacturer s vehicles 
in the automotive components industry  products typically proceed through five stages of research and development 
initial research on the product concept comes first  to assess its technical feasibility and economic costs and benefits 
this stage often includes development of an internal prototype for the component supplier s own evaluation 
if the product appears feasible  the component supplier manufactures a functioning prototype to demonstrate and test the product s features 
these prototypes are then marketed and sold to automotive companies for testing and evaluation 
if an automobile manufacturer shows interest in the product  it typically works with the component supplier to refine the product  then purchases second and subsequent generation engineering prototypes for further evaluation 
finally  the automobile manufacturer either decides to purchase the component for a production vehicle or terminates the program 
the time required to progress through these five stages to commercialization varies widely 
generally  the more a component must be integrated with other vehicle systems  the longer the process takes 
further  products that are installed by the factory usually require extra time for evaluation because other vehicle systems are affected  and a decision to introduce the product into the vehicle is not easily reversed 
because our automotive products affect other vehicle systems and is a factory installed item  the process takes a significant amount of time to commercialization 
other ted products that we develop are also likely to have a lengthy sales cycle 
because such technology is new and evolving  and because customers will likely require that any new product we develop pass certain feasibility and economic viability tests before committing to purchase  it is expected that any new products we develop will take some years before they are sold to customers 
the automotive industry is subject to intense competition and our current automotive products may be rendered obsolete by future technological developments in the industry the automotive component industry is subject to intense competition 
many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
competitors are promoting new products that may compete with our products 
additionally  heat only devices are readily available from our competitors at relatively low prices 
competition extends to attracting and retaining qualified technical and marketing personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors  that the marketplace will consider our current or proposed products to be superior or even comparable to those of our competitors  or that we can succeed in establishing new or maintaining existing relationships with automobile manufacturers 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that competitive pressures we face will not adversely affect our financial performance 

table of contents due to the rapid pace of technological change  as with any technology based product  our products may even be rendered obsolete by future developments in the industry 
our competitive position would be adversely affected if we were unable to anticipate such future developments and obtain access to the new technology 
any failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and competitive position we believe that patents and proprietary rights have been and will continue to be very important in enabling us to compete 
there can be no assurance that any new patents will be granted or that our or our licensors s and proprietary rights will not be challenged or circumvented or will provide us with meaningful competitive advantages or that pending patent applications will be approved 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or will not design around any patents that have been or may be issued to our licensors or us 
also  failure to obtain patents in certain foreign countries may materially adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in those international markets 
because of rapid technological developments in the automotive industry and the competitive nature of the market  the patent position of any component manufacturer is subject to uncertainties and may involve complex legal and factual issues 
consequently  although we either own or have licenses to certain patents  and are currently processing several additional patent applications  it is possible that no patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed in any existing or future patents issued or licensed to us will be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  or that any rights granted under such patents will not provide us adequate protection 
there is an additional risk that we may be required to participate in interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions or may be required to commence litigation to protect our rights  which could result in substantial costs 
our products may conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors or others other persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of our products for allegedly conflicting with patents held by them 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of effort by our management and technical personnel 
if any such actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products 
there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain needed patents  licenses or proprietary information held by others may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our time and resources 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties suggesting that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
while we believe that none of the claims of infringement received to date are valid  we must spend time and resources reviewing those claims and defending ourselves 
we rely on trade secret protection through confidentiality agreements and the agreements could be breached we rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with employees  customers and other parties 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors 
to the extent that consultants  key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed projects  disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information that may not be resolved in our favor 
we may be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of proprietary rights 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort by our management and technical personnel 
additionally  with respect to licensed technology  there can be no assurance that the licensor of the technology will have the resources  financial or otherwise  or desire to defend against any challenges to the rights of such licensor to its patents 

table of contents our most significant customers typically reserve the right unilaterally to cancel contracts or reduce prices  and the exercise of such right could reduce or eliminate any financial benefit to us anticipated from such contract automotive customers typically reserve the right unilaterally to cancel contracts completely or to require price reductions 
although they generally reimburse companies for actual out of pocket costs incurred with respect to the particular contract up to the point of cancellation  these reimbursements typically do not cover costs associated with acquiring general purpose assets such as facilities and capital equipment  and may be subject to negotiation and substantial delays in receipt by us 
any unilateral cancellation of  or price reduction with respect to any contract that we may obtain could reduce or eliminate any financial benefits anticipated from such contract and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the third parties that have agreed to reimburse portions of our research and development expenses generally also reserve the right to unilaterally terminate those contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive the third party reimbursements for any of our research and development efforts 
our success will depend in large part on retaining key personnel our success will depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of key personnel 
the loss of the services of daniel r 
coker  our president and chief executive officer  caspar baumhauer  the chief executive officer of wet  or other officers could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business 
our success will also depend  in part  upon our ability to retain qualified engineering and other technical and marketing personnel 
there is significant competition for technologically qualified personnel in our business and we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining sufficient qualified personnel 
our reliance on outside major contractors may impair our ability to complete certain projects and manufacture products on a timely basis we have engaged outside contractors to perform product assembly and other production functions for us 
we believe that there are other outside contractors that provide services of the kind that are used by us and that we may desire to use in the future 
however  no assurance can be given that any such contractors would agree to work for us on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our inability to engage outside contractors on acceptable terms or at all would impair our ability to complete any development and or manufacturing contracts for which outside contractors services may be needed 
moreover  our reliance upon third party contractors for certain production functions reduces our control over the manufacture of our products and makes us dependent in part upon such third parties to deliver our products in a timely manner  with satisfactory quality controls and on a competitive basis 
our business exposes us to potential environmental liability risks because wet operates its own manufacturing facilities  it is exposed to potential environmental remediation risks which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
costs associated with environmental regulation at sites where wet may be liable and future expenses that wet may incur to remediate environmental damages could be considerably higher than anticipated 
because many of the largest automotive manufacturers are located in foreign countries  our business is subject to the risks associated with foreign sales many of the world s largest automotive manufacturers are located in foreign countries 
accordingly  our business is subject to many of the risks of international operations  including governmental controls  tariff restrictions  foreign currency fluctuations and currency control regulations 
no assurance can be given that existing contracts will be honored by our foreign suppliers or customers 

table of contents the company began a foreign currency risk management strategy in january that includes the use of derivative financial instruments designed to protect our economic value from the possible adverse effects of currency fluctuations as it relates to payments to suppliers 
there is no certainty that we will not suffer losses in connection with any derivative instruments 
the recent global economic and financial market crisis has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our business and operations 
the recent global economic and financial market crisis has caused  among other things  a general tightening in the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy  lower consumer and business spending  and lower consumer net worth  all of which has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
many of our tier one customers  their oem customers and our suppliers have been severely affected by the recent economic turmoil  including bankruptcy 
there is no certainty that our customers and suppliers will continue to be in business 
the recent crisis could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products and could result in customer payment delays or defaults 
further  suppliers may not be able to supply us with needed raw materials on a timely basis  may increase prices or go out of business  which could result in our inability to meet consumer demand or affect our financial results 
although there has been some improvement in economic conditions starting in  the timing and nature of any recovery in the credit and financial markets remains uncertain  and there can be no assurance that market conditions will continue to improve in the near future or that our financial results will not continue to be materially and adversely affected 
such conditions make it very difficult to forecast operating results  make business decisions and identify and address material business risks 
the foregoing conditions may also impact the valuation of our federal net operating loss carryforwards nols which are subject to impairment testing  potentially resulting in impairment charges which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
see note of our consolidated financial statements and related financial information indexed on page f of this report for a more complete description of our nols 
we may not realize significant benefits from the wet acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges 
the success of our acquisition of wet will depend  in part  on our ability to fully integrate wet s business with our existing business 
the integration process may be complex  costly and time consuming 
the difficulties of integrating the operations of wet with the operations of gentherm include  among others failure to implement our business plan for the combined business  unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing  logistics  information  communications and other systems  diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters  challenges assimilating management and other personnel from wet  including because of differences in culture  language and background  the size of wet s operations relative to our existing business  unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations  failure to retain key employees  operating risks inherent in the wet business and our business  the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  and unanticipated issues  expenses and liabilities 

table of contents we may not accomplish the integration of wet smoothly  successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe 
the diversion of the attention of management from our operations to the integration effort and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the wet acquisition and could adversely affect our business 
following completion of the acquisition of wet  we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment testing 
as a result of our acquisition of wet we now have significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill impairment is indicated and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired when their book value exceeds their fair value 
the value of goodwill and other intangible assets from the allocation of the purchase price from the wet acquisition will be derived from our business operating plans and is susceptible to an adverse change in demand  input costs or general changes in our business or industry and could require an impairment charge in the future 
we may incur significant additional integration costs in connection with the acquisition of wet we have incurred significant costs in connection with the acquisition of wet we may  in the future  incur additional costs to maintain employee morale  retain key employees and formulate and implement our integration plans 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations resulting from the acquisition of wet and such substantial debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we incurred substantial additional debt in connection with the acquisition of wet our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our future operations 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we cannot service our indebtedness  we may have to take actions such as selling assets  seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances  any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business 
additionally  we may not be able to effect such actions  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our substantial debt obligations could have important consequences to our business 
for example we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes  including for working capital  dividends  business development efforts and to finance mergers and acquisitions  our ability to borrow more money for operations  working capital or to finance future mergers and acquisitions will be limited  limiting our ability to refinance or repay debt obligations when they become due  we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings  including under our credit facility  are at variable rates of interest  and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited  thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness 

table of contents the covenants to which we are subject under our credit facility restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  grant additional liens against our assets  prepay obligations  make investments and enter into various types of agreements 
we are additionally prohibited from making general dividends and other payments with respect to our equity interests in cash  excluding any such payments with respect to the preferred shares 
while not unusual for a financing of this type  the restrictions in our credit facility may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans 
holders of the preferred shares have rights that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
under our articles of incorporation  we are subject to certain covenants that limit our ability to create new series of preferred stock  other than series junior to the series c convertible preferred stock the preferred shares  and to offer and sell certain types of variable priced securities 
we are also limited  with certain exceptions  in our ability to incur additional debt while the preferred shares are outstanding 
such restrictions may have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business while the preferred shares are outstanding 
risks related to our common stock our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  and the relatively small average daily trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and stock price our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to such factors as acceptance of our product by automotive manufacturers and consumers  timing of our product introductions  availability and pricing of components from third parties  competition  timing of orders  foreign currency exchange rates  technological changes  resources spent on litigation activities and economic conditions generally 
broad market fluctuations in the stock markets can adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  failure to meet or exceed analysts expectations of financial performance may result in immediate and significant price and volume fluctuations in our common stock 
historically  the average daily trading volume of our common stock has been relatively low as compared to the total number of outstanding shares of common stock 
without a significantly larger number of shares made available for trading by the public  our common stock is less liquid than stocks with more trading activity  and as a result  trading prices of our common stock may significantly fluctuate and certain institutional investors may be unwilling to invest in such a thinly traded security 
we have anti takeover defenses that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock our board of directors our board has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights including conversion rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders  however   preferred shares were issued as the preferred shares 
consequently  only  shares of preferred stock are available for issuance 
consistent with this authority  in january  our board adopted a shareholder rights plan the rights plan in which one purchase right was distributed as a dividend on each share of company common stock held of record as of the close of business on february  the rights 
if exercisable  each right will entitle its holder to purchase from the company one one thousandth of a share of a newly created series b preferred stock of the company for the purchase price 
the rights will become exercisable if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of or more of the company s common stock or has commenced a tender or exchange offer which  if consummated  would result in any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of or more of the company s common stock 
if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of or more of the company s common stock  each right will entitle its holder  other than the acquiring person  to purchase a number of shares of the company s or the acquiror s common stock having a value of twice the purchase price 

table of contents the rights are deemed attached to the certificates representing outstanding shares of common stock 
the rights plan is designed to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent an acquiror from gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all of the company s shareholders  however  the existence of the rights plan and the rights of holders of any other shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the terms of the preferred shares  including with respect to redemption  conversion  dividend payments and amortization  may put pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
the preferred shares are convertible into shares of our common stock and we may redeem  pay dividends on or amortization amounts on  the preferred shares in cash  common stock  or any combination thereof 
if our preferred shares are converted into common stock or if we redeem  pay dividends or amortization amounts with shares of common stock  the amount of stock we issue will be determined by reference to the average lowest fifteen volume weighted average prices of our common stock during the twenty consecutive trading days ending two days prior to the date on which we determine whether to pay dividends or amortization amounts in shares of our common stock 
sales of our common stock during this twenty day trading period by us  or permitted hedging activities by other investors  including holders of the preferred shares  could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 
our issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock to holders of preferred shares could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
issuance by us of a substantial amount of additional shares of our common stock to the holders of preferred shares upon conversion of  redemption of or payment of dividends on such preferred shares as permitted by our articles of incorporation could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
we are currently prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock 
furthermore  we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the future 
under the terms of our articles of incorporation  so long as any preferred shares are outstanding  no dividends or distributions whether in cash  any securities or other property are permitted to be made to holders of common stock 
furthermore  our bank credit facility also prohibits payment of dividends on our common stock so long as such facility is outstanding 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future 
the repurchase right in the preferred shares triggered by a change of control or other fundamental transaction could discourage a potential acquirer 
we may be required to repurchase all of the preferred shares in connection with a change of control or fundamental transaction as such terms are defined in the instruments governing the preferred shares 
such repurchase rights could discourage a potential acquirer due to the potentially significant costs associated with repurchasing such securities 
if any holder of preferred shares converts its preferred shares into our common stock  or we use our common stock in connection with periodic redemptions of or dividend payments on  the preferred shares  our common stockholders will experience immediate dilution 
any holder of the preferred shares may  at any time  convert its preferred shares into our common stock 
if any holder of our preferred shares so converts  our common stockholders will experience immediate dilution 
in addition  our common stockholders will also experience dilution when and if we issue shares of common stock in connection with periodic redemptions of and dividend payments on the preferred shares 

table of contents we are required to redeem the preferred shares in nine equal quarterly installments beginning on september  and ending on september  by paying cash  issuing shares of our common stock or any combination thereof for  per preferred share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends 
if certain conditions are met  we can pay the installment amounts  as well as dividends  on the preferred shares  in shares of our common stock 
in the event of a conversion by a holder of preferred shares into our common stock  the conversion ratio is computed as the price paid for the preferred shares being converted divided by  and then rounded up to the nearest whole share 
in the event we elect to issue shares of common stock in connection with periodic redemptions of and dividend payments on the preferred shares  the conversion ratio is computed as the dollar amount being converted divided by the lower of a and b the market price as of the date of conversation 
the market price  for this purpose  is computed as a ten percent discount to the arithmetic average of the lowest fifteen volume weighted average closing prices of our common stock during the twenty consecutive trading day period ending two trading days prior to the date of determination 
consequently  the number of shares of common stock that may be issued in connection with periodic redemptions of and dividend payments on the preferred shares will fluctuate with the closing price of our common stock and will increase if the price of our common stock decreases 
the resulting dilution of our existing common stockholders would increase if the price of our common stock decreases 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors  including general market and economic conditions  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results  funds from operations  cash flows  liquidity or distributions  changes in our earnings estimates or those of analysts  publication of research reports about us  the automotive industry generally or automotive supplier industry  and recommendations by financial analysts with respect to us or other automotive suppliers  adverse market reaction to the amount of our outstanding debt at any time  the amount of our maturing debt in the near and medium term and our ability to refinance such debt and the terms thereof or our plans to incur additional debt in the future  the ability of our customers to pay us and meet their other obligations to us under current contract terms and our ability to hold and expand our customer base  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our shares of capital stock to demand a higher dividend yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any securities we may register or issue or additional debt we incur in the future  additions or departures of key management personnel  actions by institutional stockholders  speculation in the press or investment community  continuing high levels of volatility in the capital and credit markets  and the realization of any of the other risk factors included in  or incorporated by reference to  this report on form k 

table of contents many of the factors listed above are beyond our control 
these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline  regardless of our financial performance and condition and prospects 
it is impossible to provide any assurance that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future  and it may be difficult for holders to resell shares of our common stock at prices they find attractive  or at all 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the preferred shares as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage activity that may develop involving our common stock 
our common stock ranks junior to our preferred shares 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or winding up  any rights that our common stockholders may have will be junior to the rights of the holders of our preferred shares and therefore any outstanding preferred shares may reduce the amount available to our common stockholders in the event of any such liquidation event 
in the event we are unable to continue as a going concern or otherwise liquidate  the holders of the preferred shares will have a liquidation preference equal to the greater of i the sum of the stated value  accrued and unpaid dividends of and on such holder s preferred shares and the amount of all future dividends through the maturity date that would have been received in the absence of liquidation  and ii an amount that a holder would have received in liquidation had the preferred shares been converted immediately prior to the event of liquidation 
in such an event  the preferred shares may significantly diminish the amounts  if any  available for distribution to holders of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the wet acquisition 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of our acquisition of wet if  among other things  we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings 
the market price of our common stock also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the wet acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the wet acquisition on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 
additional risks related to our series c convertible preferred stock we may not have sufficient earnings and profits in order for distributions on the preferred shares to be treated as dividends 
distributions paid on the preferred shares may exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for us federal income tax purposes 
if that occurs  the amount of the distribution that exceeds such earnings and profits will be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the holder s adjusted tax basis in the preferred stock  and the excess  if any  over such adjusted tax basis  will generally be treated as capital gain 
such treatment  as opposed to dividend treatment  may be unfavorable for corporate holders and certain other holders 
we may not be able to pay amounts due to holders of the preferred shares in the event of certain defaults in our payment obligations and in connection with certain other events under the preferred shares 
any failure to pay any amounts due to the holders of the preferred shares  as well as certain other triggering events  including  without limitation  our failure to timely deliver shares  our suspension of trading  our failure to keep reserved for issuance an adequate number of shares of common stock to cover conversion of the preferred shares  and breaches of certain representations  warranties and covenants that are not timely cured  where a cure period is permitted  would permit the holders of our preferred shares to compel our redemption of such preferred shares in cash at a price per share containing a significant premium to the stated value of the preferred shares  
table of contents plus an additional make whole amount per preferred share being redeemed 
if one of the enumerated triggering events occurs  or if for any other reason we are required to redeem the preferred shares in cash prior to maturity  no assurance can be given that we would have the cash or financial resources available to us to make such a payment  and such an acceleration could cause us to be in default under or breach our obligations under our credit facility  have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and may impair our ability to operate our business as a going concern 
the preferred shares are subordinated to our credit facility 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisition of wet the preferred shares rank junior and are subordinate to this bank indebtedness and certain other liabilities pursuant to  among other things  a subordination agreement entered into between investors in the preferred shares and our lender the subordination agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the subordination agreement and our credit facility  we are not permitted to make  and the holders of our preferred shares are not permitted to accept  cash payments on account of the preferred shares unless no default or event of default then exists under the credit facility or would result from the making of the payment and we are in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the credit facility 
there are no comparable restrictions on our ability to pay obligations on the preferred shares through issuance of common shares 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or winding up  our assets will only be available to pay obligations on the preferred shares  including dividends and amortization amounts  after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid in full

see also forward looking statements in item a of this report 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary thermal seat comfort systems and cable systems for sale to automobile and truck original equipment manufacturers oems 
in  we completed our thirteenth full year of producing and selling our climate control seat ccs products  which provide year round comfort by providing both heating and cooling to seat occupants 
we also sell a heated and cooled cup holder and a heated and cooled mattress that utilize our proprietary ted technology 
on may   we acquired a majority interest in wet  a german publicly traded company based in odelzhausen  germany 
wet s primary product categories include automotive seat comfort systems and specialized automotive cable systems 
the automotive seat comfort systems category includes automotive seat heaters  climate comfort systems similar to gentherm s climate controlled seat technology for automotive seats  automotive steering wheel heater systems and integrated electronic components 
the specialized automotive cable systems category includes ready made wire harnesses and related wiring products 
wet s primary customers are also tier suppliers and automotive oems 
wet also offers product solutions to other customer groups  namely customer groups related to seat heating equipment for the automotive aftermarket  ski lifts and sports stadiums and the production of ventilation systems for the automotive and various other industries 
we primarily sell directly to seat manufacturers 
our five largest customers are johnson controls  lear corporation  magna  sanyo and dymos 
we operate as a tier ii supplier to the auto industry 
inherent in this market are costs and commitments well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers 
this is due in part to automotive manufacturers requiring the coordination and testing of proposed new components and sub systems 
revenues from these expenditures may not be realized for two to three years as the manufacturers tend to group new components and enhancements into annual or every two to three year vehicle model introductions 
these customers in turn sell our product  as a component of an entire seat or seating system  to automotive oems 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to warranty reserves  litigation reserves  
table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventory reserves  stock compensation and patents 
accrued warranty costs historical gentherm does not offer our customers explicit warranty terms  however  we do honor warranty claims for defective products 
wet offers customers explicit warranty terms 
we have secured errors and omissions insurance which provides certain coverage for defects in our product designs  however  historical gentherm does not maintain a product recall insurance policy 
wet maintains a product recall insurance policy 
provision for estimated future cost of warranty for product delivered is recorded when revenue is recognized 
while we believe our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimates could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
the warranty policy is reviewed by management annually 
based on historical information available to the company and claims filed to date  the warranty accrual is periodically adjusted to reflect management s best estimate of future claims 
litigation reserves we record estimated future costs related to new or ongoing litigation 
these estimates include costs associated with attorney fees and potential claims and assessments less any amounts recoverable under insurance policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an accounts receivable is specifically identified 
we analyze the length of time an accounts receivable is outstanding  as well as a customer s payment history to determine the need for and amount of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes we record income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted federal and state tax rates 
a valuation allowance is provided for a portion of our net deferred tax assets when we consider it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
at december  and  a valuation allowance has been provided for an estimated portion of our nols generated prior to a change in control  as defined by the internal revenue code  which limits our ability to utilize those nols 
if future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels  there is a risk that some of our nols not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization 
we do not expect significant differences between our taxable income and our book earnings before income taxes 
we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
stock based compensation we account for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant 
we determine fair value of such awards 
table of contents using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions  such as risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and expected life of options  in order to arrive at a fair value estimate 
expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of the company s common stock and that of an index of companies in our industry group 
since the company has little historical data to help evaluate the expected lives of options  we considered several other factors in developing this assumption including the average holding period of outstanding options  their remaining terms and the cycle of our long range business plan 
the risk free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for united states treasury debt securities 
the expected dividend yield is based upon the company s history of having never issued a dividend and management s current expectation of future action surrounding dividends 
we believe that the assumptions selected by management are reasonable  however  significant changes could materially impact the results of the calculation of fair value 
patent costs our business strategy largely centers on designing products based upon internally developed and licensed technology 
when possible  we protect these technologies with patents 
during the fourth quarter  we changed our method of accounting for costs  all of which were external  associated with the application for patents 
prior to the change we capitalized the external legal and filing fees associated with new patent applications in addition to the cost of purchased patents 
these costs were then amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic useful lives which ranged from to seventeen years 
under the new method  external legal costs are expensed as incurred and classified as research and development expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
we believe that this change is preferable because it will result in consistent treatment for all costs  that is  under our new method both internal and external costs associated with the application for patents are expensed as incurred 
in addition  the change will provide a better comparison with our industry peers 
costs associated with the purchase of patents and patent rights  including those acquired in conjunction with a business combination  continue to be capitalized as before 
we periodically review the recoverability and remaining life of our capitalized patents based upon market conditions  competitive technologies and our projected business plans 
change in these conditions could materially impact the carrying value for our capitalized patents

finally  the american taxpayer relief act of the act was signed into law but not until january  the act retroactively restored the research and development credit and certain exemptions under the foreign income tax rules  however  because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment  the retroactive effect of the act on the company s us federal taxes for  a benefit of approximately  will not be recognized until the first quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these differences
