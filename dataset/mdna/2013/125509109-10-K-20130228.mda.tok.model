effective december   cigna changed its external reporting segments to reflect the company realignment of its businesses to better leverage distribution and service delivery capabilities for the benefit of our global clients and customers 
management believes the realignment of its businesses will enable the company to more effectively address global health services challenges by leveraging best practices across geographies to improve the health  well being and sense of security of the global customers that the company serves 
the changes in the company internal financial reporting structure  to support this realignment  took effect on december  and resulted in changes to our external reporting segments 
the company results are now aggregated based on the nature of the company products and services  rather than its geographies 
the primary segment reporting change is that the two businesses that comprised the former international segment international health care cigna corporation form k 
back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and supplemental health  life and accident are now reported as follows substantially all of the international health care business comprised primarily of the global health benefits business is now reported with the former health care segment and renamed global health care  and the supplemental health  life and accident business becomes a separate reporting segment named global supplemental benefits 
as a result of these changes  the financial results of cigna businesses are now reported in the following segments global health care aggregates the following two operating segments commercial including the international health care business government group disability and life global supplemental benefits run off reinsurance and other operations  including corporate owned life insurance 
prior year segment information has been conformed to the new segment structure 
significant factors affecting the company for information on the company business strategy  see the description of business section of this form k beginning on page the company ability to increase revenue  shareholders net income and operating cash flows from ongoing operations is directly related to progress in executing its strategy as well as other key factors  including the company ability to profitably underwrite and price products and services at competitive levels that manage risk and reflect emerging experience  cross sell its various health and related benefit products  invest available cash at attractive rates of return for appropriate durations  and effectively deploy capital 
in addition to the company specific factors cited above  overall results are influenced by a range of economic and other factors  especially cost trends and inflation for medical and related services  utilization patterns of medical and other services  employment levels  the tort liability system  developments in the political environment both domestically and internationally  including us health care reform  interest rates  equity market returns  foreign currency fluctuations and credit market volatility  including the availability and cost of credit in the future  medicare reimbursement rates issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  including the bonus structure based on cms performance ratings  and federal  state and international regulation 
the company regularly monitors the trends impacting operating results from the above mentioned key factors to appropriately respond to economic and other factors affecting its operations  both in its ongoing and run off operations 
run off operations as of december  the company run off reinsurance operations had significant exposures  primarily from its guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb  also known as vadbe and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib products 
effective february   the company entered into an agreement to reinsure of the company future exposures for these businesses  net of retrocessional arrangements in place prior to february   up to a specified limit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
health care reform in the first quarter of  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act health care reform were signed into law 
certain of the law provisions are already effective while others will take effect from to the company has implemented the provisions of health care reform that are currently in effect including the commercial minimum medical loss ratio requirements and continues its implementation planning for those provisions that must be adopted in the future 
management is currently unable to estimate the full impact of health care reform on the company future results of operations  and its financial condition and liquidity due to uncertainties related to interpretation  implementation and timing of its many provisions as well as the potential for the law to be amended 
it is possible  however  that certain provisions of health care reform could have a material impact on future results of operations 
commercial minimum medical loss ratio requirements became effective in january  requiring payment of premium rebates beginning in to employers and customers covered under the company comprehensive commercial medical insurance plans if certain annual minimum loss ratios are not met 
the company recorded its rebate accrual based on estimated medical loss ratios calculated as prescribed by the us department of health and human services hhs using full year premium and claim information by state and market segment for each legal entity that issues comprehensive medical insurance 
hhs regulations permit adjustments to be made to the claims used in the calculation for cigna international health care and limited benefits plans subject to the mlr minimums 
the adjustments for limited benefit plans are only allowed through in  the company accrued an estimated rebate of million pre tax million after tax  compared with an accrual of million pre tax million after tax in the company paid million in  slightly higher than the estimated rebate accrual of million  primarily due cigna corporation form k 
back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to the favorable claim run out of estimated claim reserves in the decrease in the estimated rebate accrual compared to reflects changes to the minimum loss ratio calculation in accordance with hhs regulations that can include combined and experience including rebates paid for the plan year  lower premiums resulting from a change in business practice regarding the billing for broker commissions  as well as modestly higher loss ratios due to slightly higher utilization 
health care reform imposes new fees on health insurers that become payable in and payment of these fees will result in charges to the company financial results in future periods 
these fees will generally not be tax deductible with the exception of the reinsurance assessments on insurers and hmos 
accordingly  the company effective tax rate is expected to be adversely impacted in future periods 
the amount of the fees is expected to be material  although the company is unable to estimate the impact of these fees on shareholders net income and the effective tax rate because guidance for these calculations has not been finalized 
health care reform also impacts cigna medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan businesses acquired with healthspring in a variety of additional ways  including reduced medicare premium rates that began with the contract year  mandated minimum reductions to risk scores beginning in  transition of medicare advantage benchmark rates to medicare fee for service parity  reduced enrollment periods and limitations on disenrollment  providing quality bonuses for medicare advantage plans with a rating of four or five stars from cms  and mandated consumer discounts on brand name and generic prescription drugs for medicare part d plan participants in the coverage gap 
beginning in  health care reform requires medicare advantage and medicare part d plans to meet a minimum mlr of 
under the rules proposed by hhs  if the mlr for a cms contract is less than  the contractor is required to pay a penalty to cms and could be subject to additional sanctions if the mlr continues to be less than for successive years 
effective in  each state is required to establish a health insurance exchange for individuals and small employers with enrollment processes scheduled to commence in october of these exchanges may either be state based  a state partnership  or federally facilitated 
of the ten states where the company currently offers individual coverage  most currently expect to use a federally facilitated exchange 
cigna will continue to evaluate its potential participation in these exchanges in each market as they develop 
on june   the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of most parts of health care reform  including the obligation to purchase health care coverage the individual mandate 
management continues to closely monitor the implementation of health care reform and is actively engaged with regulators and policymakers on the conversion of legislation to regulation 
in addition  management is implementing the necessary capabilities to ensure that the company is compliant with the law and assessing potential opportunities arising from health care reform 
these opportunities include the continued evolution and innovation of our broad health and wellness portfolio to improve the health and productivity of our clients and customers  as well as the expansion of our physician partnership capabilities to improve the quality of care and service experience for our customers while lowering costs and improving overall value 
for additional information regarding health care reform  see the regulation section of the company form k

as a result  the company recognized charges in other operating expenses of million pre tax million after tax in the third quarter of  consisting primarily of severance costs 
the global health care segment reported million pre tax million after tax of the charge 
the remainder was reported as follows million pre tax million after tax in global supplemental benefits and million pre tax million after tax in group disability and life

adjusted income loss from operations is defined as consolidated segment earnings loss excluding special items described in the table below and the results of the gmib business 
adjusted income loss from operations is another measure of profitability used by the company management because it presents the underlying results of operations of the company businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue  expenses and shareholders net income 
this measure is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measure  that is shareholders net income 
the company excludes special items because management does not believe they are representative of the company underlying results of operations 
the company also excludes the results of the gmib business because the changes in the fair value of gmib assets and liabilities are volatile and unpredictable 
see the run off reinsurance section of the md a for additional information on gmib 
because of this volatility  and since the gmib business is in run off  management does not believe that its results are meaningful in assessing underlying results of operations

back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table  there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements  including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits  as well as estimates with respect to unpaid claims and claim expenses  postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions  certain compensation accruals  and income taxes 
as explained further in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective february   the company entered into an agreement to reinsure of the company gmdb and gmib businesses  net of retrocessional arrangements in place prior to february   up to a specified limit 
as a result  the company will no longer consider liabilities associated with these contracts to be a critical accounting estimate because changes in these estimates are not expected to have a material effect on the company consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in the company consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in the company consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on the company liquidity and financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact the company 
balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate effect if different assumptions used goodwill at the acquisition date  goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually during the third quarter at the reporting unit level  based on discounted cash flow analyses and writes it down through results of operations if impaired 
discounted cash flow analyses use assumptions and estimates including discount rates and projections of future earnings considering operating plans  revenues  claims  operating expenses  taxes  capital levels and long term growth rates 
goodwill as of december was as follows in millions see notes h and to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company goodwill 
if the company does not achieve its earnings objectives or its cost of capital rises significantly  the assumptions and estimates underlying these impairment evaluations could be adversely affected and result in impairment charges that would negatively impact the company operating results 
the fair value estimates of the company reporting units could decrease by to before an indication of impairment of goodwill occurs 
this potential outcome is estimated during the company annual testing process  by determining the magnitude of changes to certain assumptions and estimates necessary for the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to approach its carrying value

back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate effect if different assumptions used accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities pension liabilities these liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and nonqualified pension benefits to be paid attributed to employee service to date net of the fair value of plan assets 
the accrued pension benefit liability as of december was as follows in millions see note to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions and methods used to estimate pension liabilities 
using past experience  the company expects that it is reasonably possible that a favorable or unfavorable change in assumptions for the discount rate or expected return on plan assets of basis points could occur 
an unfavorable change is a decrease in these key assumptions with resulting impacts as discussed below 
if discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased by basis points annual pension costs for would decrease by approximately million  after tax  and the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million as of december  if the expected long term return on domestic qualified pension plan assets decreased by basis points  annual pension costs for would increase by approximately million after tax 
if the company used the market value of assets to measure pension costs as opposed to the market related value  annual pension cost for would decrease by approximately million after tax 
if the december  fair values of domestic qualified plan assets decreased by  the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million 
an increase in these key assumptions would result in impacts to annual pension costs  the accrued pension liability and shareholders equity in an opposite direction  but similar amounts 
global health care medical claims payable medical claims payable for the global health care segment include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported 
liabilities for medical claims payable as of december were as follows in millions gross  net  gross  net  these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables and generally exclude amounts for administrative services only business 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability 
in  actual experience differed from the company key assumptions as of december   resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable or of the current year incurred claims as reported in in  actual experience differed from the company key assumptions as of december   resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims  or of the current year incurred claims reported in specifically  the favorable impact is due to faster than expected completion factors and lower than expected medical cost trends  both of which included an assumption for moderately adverse experience 
the impact of this favorable prior year development was an increase to shareholders net income of million after tax million pre tax in the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in shareholders net income as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements

back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate effect if different assumptions used valuation of fixed maturity investments most fixed maturities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date 
the determination of fair value for a financial instrument requires management judgment 
the degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of pricing readily observable in the markets 
financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets or with market observable inputs to determine fair value  such as public securities  generally require less judgment 
conversely  private placements including more complex securities that are traded infrequently are typically measured using pricing models that require more judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value 
there may be a number of alternative inputs to select  based on an understanding of the issuer  the structure of the security and overall market conditions 
in addition  these factors are inherently variable in nature as they change frequently in response to market conditions 
approximately two thirds of the company fixed maturities are public securities  and one third are private placement securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company fair value measurements and the procedures performed by management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates 
typically  the most significant input in the measurement of fair value is the market interest rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows from the instrument 
such market rates are derived by calculating the appropriate spreads over comparable us treasury securities  based on the credit quality  industry and structure of the asset 
if the spreads used to calculate fair value changed by basis points  the fair value of the total fixed maturity portfolio of billion would change by approximately billion 
assessment of other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities to determine whether a fixed maturity decline in fair value below its amortized cost is other than temporary  the company must evaluate the expected recovery in value and its intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale of the fixed maturity prior to an expected recovery 
to make this determination  the company considers a number of general and specific factors including the regulatory  economic and market environment  length of time and severity of the decline  and the financial health and specific near term prospects of the issuer 
see notes c and to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company review of declines in fair value  including information regarding the company accounting policies for fixed maturities 
for all fixed maturities with cost in excess of their fair value  if this excess was determined to be other than temporary  shareholders net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million after tax 
segment reporting the company measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings loss  which is defined as shareholders income loss from continuing operations excluding after tax realized investment gains and losses 
adjusted income from operations for each segment is defined as segment earnings excluding special items and the results of the company gmib business 
adjusted income from operations is the primary measure of profitability used by the company management because it presents the underlying results of operations of the segment and permits analysis of trends 
each segment provides a reconciliation between segment earnings and adjusted income from operations

under the gaap guidance for fair value measurements  the company results of operations have been volatile because capital market assumptions needed to estimate the assets and liabilities for the gmib business are based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each reporting period including interest rates libor swap curve and market implied volatilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and asset and liability balances related to gmib and note for additional information regarding the hedge programs to hedge a portion of equity and interest rate risks in gmib contracts 
gmib fair value gains of million for  were primarily due to the effect of increases in underlying account values  updates in the claim exposure calculation  and a reduction in annuitization rates  partially offset by a reduction in lapse rates and general declines in interest rates 
gmib fair value losses of million for  were primarily due to a decline in both the interest rate used for projecting claim exposure year treasury rates and the rate used for projecting market returns and discounting libor swap curve 
gmib fair value losses of million for  were primarily due to declining interest rates  partially offset by increases in underlying account values resulting from favorable equity and bond fund returns 
the gmib liabilities and related assets are calculated using an internal model and assumptions from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
payments for gmib claims are expected to occur over the next to years and will be based on actual values of the underlying mutual funds and the year treasury rate at the dates benefits are elected

as explained in other revenues above  these changes do not affect shareholders net income because they are offset by gains or losses on futures contracts used to hedge equity market and interest rate performance 
reserve strengthening 
the following highlights the impacts of gmdb reserve strengthening the reserve strengthening was driven primarily by reductions to the lapse rate assumptions  an update to management consideration of the anticipated impact of continued low short term interest rates  and to a lesser extent  an increase to the volatility and correlation assumptions  partially offset by favorable equity market conditions 
the reserve strengthening was driven primarily by volatility related impacts due to the turbulent equity market conditions  an update to management consideration of the anticipated impact of the continued low level of short term interest rates  and the adverse impacts of overall market declines  including an increase in the provision for future partial surrenders and declines in the value of contract holders non equity investments such as bond funds  neither of which are included in the hedge program 
the reserve strengthening was driven primarily by management consideration of the anticipated impact of the continued low level of current short term interest rates  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in assumed lapse rates for policies that have taken or are assumed to take significant partial withdrawals

these factors were partially offset by increased net interest expense due to higher average borrowings outstanding in liquidity and capital resources financial summary in millions short term investments cash and cash equivalents short term debt long term debt shareholders equity liquidity the company maintains liquidity at two levels the subsidiary level and the parent company level 
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of claim and benefit payments to policyholders  operating expense requirements  primarily for employee compensation and benefits  and dividends and federal tax payments to the parent company 
the company subsidiaries normally meet their operating requirements by maintaining appropriate levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  using cash flows from operating activities  selling investments  matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities  and borrowing from its parent company 
liquidity requirements at the parent level generally consist of debt service and dividend payments to shareholders  pension plan funding  and federal tax payments 
the parent normally meets its liquidity requirements by maintaining appropriate levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  collecting dividends and federal tax payments from its subsidiaries  using proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities  and borrowing from its subsidiaries

back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources the company capital resources primarily retained earnings and the proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
management  guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines  determines the amount of capital resources that the company maintains 
management allocates resources to new long term business commitments when returns  considering the risks  look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate 
the company prioritizes its use of capital resources to provide capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries  consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous  and return capital to investors through share repurchase 
the availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions 
extreme volatility in credit or equity market conditions may reduce the company ability to issue debt or equity securities 
cash flows for the years ended december  were as follows in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows from operating activities consist of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums and fees  mail order pharmacy and other revenues  gains losses recognized in connection with the company gmdb and gmib equity hedge programs  investment income  taxes  and benefits and expenses 
because certain income and expense transactions do not generate cash  and because cash transactions related to revenues and expenses may occur in periods different from when those revenues and expenses are recognized in shareholders net income  cash flows from operating activities can be significantly different from shareholders net income 
cash flows from investing activities generally consist of net investment purchases or sales and net purchases of property and equipment  that includes capitalized software  as well as cash used to acquire businesses 
cash flows from financing activities are generally comprised of issuances and re payment of debt at the parent company level  proceeds on the issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises  and stock repurchases 
in addition  the subsidiaries report net deposits and withdrawals to or from investment contract liabilities that include universal life insurance liabilities because such liabilities are considered financing activities with policyholders 
operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased by million in compared with  primarily the result of strong earnings growth in the ongoing business segments in in addition  operating cash flows were adversely affected by significant claim run out from the medicare ipffs business that the company exited in investing activities cash used in investing activities was billion in  billion of which was for the acquisitions net of cash acquired of healthspring  great american supplemental benefits  and the joint venture in turkey 
cash used in investing activities also included net purchases of investments of million and net purchases of property and equipment primarily internal use software of million 
financing activities cash used in financing activities in primarily reflects the repayment of debt assumed in the healthspring acquisition of million and the repurchase of common stock for million 
these effects were partially offset by the change in short term debt of million primarily from the issuance of commercial paper  proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee benefit plans of million and net deposits to contractholder deposit funds of million 
share repurchase 
the company maintains a share repurchase program  that was authorized by its board of directors 
the decision to repurchase shares depends on market conditions and alternate uses of capital 
the company has  and may continue from time to time  to repurchase shares on the open market through a rule b plan that permits a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
the company suspends activity under this program from time to time and also removes such suspensions  generally without public announcement 
in the company repurchased million shares for million 
on february   the company board of directors increased share repurchase authority by million 
accordingly  the total remaining share repurchase authorization as of february  was million

this decrease in primarily reflects higher management compensation  income tax and pension payments in compared with and unfavorable operating cash flows in the medicare ipffs business in due to significant claim run out compared to significant favorable operating cash flows from the growth of this business in operating cash flows were favorably affected in because paid claims on this business growth lagged premium collections 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was billion 
this use of cash primarily consisted of net purchases of investments of million  cash used to fund acquisitions net of cash acquired of million  and net purchases of property and equipment of million 
financing activities cash provided from financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of billion and proceeds on issuances of common stock of million  primarily used to fund the acquisition of healthspring  inc see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
financing activities also included net deposits to contractholder deposit funds of million 
these inflows were partially offset by scheduled payments of debt of million and common stock repurchases of million 
interest expense interest expense on long term debt  short term debt and capital leases was as follows in millions interest expense the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the issuance of billion of long term debt in the fourth quarter of to fund the acquisition of healthspring  partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate reflecting the more favorable rates of this debt issued 
the weighted average interest rate for outstanding short term debt primarily commercial paper was at december  and liquidity and capital resources outlook at december   there was approximately million in cash and short term investments available at the parent company level 
in  the parent company cash obligations are expected to consist of the following scheduled interest payments of approximately million on outstanding long term debt of billion at december   contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan of million most of which is voluntary  and repayment of million of commercial paper outstanding as of december  the company expects to have at least million outstanding as of march  in addition  the parent company will be required to fund a portion of the billion reinsurance premium due to berkshire 
the premium will ultimately be paid to berkshire in cash  that will be funded by the sale or internal transfer of investment assets supporting this business  tax benefits related to the transaction  and parent cash of million 
the company expects  based on its current cash position and current projections for subsidiary dividends  to have sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations discussed above 
however  the company cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings  regulatory restrictions or rating agency capital guidelines reduce the amount of dividends available to be distributed to the parent company from the insurance and hmo subsidiaries including the impact of equity market deterioration and volatility on subsidiary capital  significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets reduces the company ability to raise capital  or a substantial increase in funding over current projections is required for the company pension plan 
in those cases  the company expects to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures  including intercompany borrowings and sales of liquid investments 
the parent company may borrow up to million from its insurance subsidiaries without prior state approval 
as of december   the parent company had no net intercompany loan balance with its insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  the company may use short term borrowings  such as the commercial paper program  the committed revolving credit and letter of credit agreement of up to billion subject to the maximum debt leverage covenant in its line of credit agreement 
as of december   the company had billion of borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  reflecting million of letters of credit issued out of the credit facility 
within the maximum debt leverage covenant in cigna corporation form k 
back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the line of credit agreement  the company has an additional billion of borrowing capacity in addition to the billion of debt outstanding 
the company maintains a capital management strategy to permanently invest the earnings for certain of its foreign operations overseas 
during the first quarter of the company expanded this strategy to its china and indonesia operations 
as of december  the company cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations were million  and permanently reinvested earnings were approximately million 
repatriation of foreign cash via a dividend of these permanently reinvested earnings would result in a charge for the incremental us taxes due on the repatriation 
because of the size  strength and diversity of earnings from domestic sources  management does not believe this global capital management strategy materially limits the company ability to meet its liquidity and capital needs in the united states 
though the company believes it has adequate sources of liquidity  continued significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect the company ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds 
solvency regulation 
many states have adopted some form of the national association of insurance commissioners naic model solvency related laws and risk based capital rules rbc rules for life and health insurance companies 
the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held  the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred 
if the ratio of the insurer adjusted surplus to its risk based capital falls below statutory required minimums  the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 
in addition  various non us jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency  liquidity and reserve coverage measures

guarantees and contractual obligations the company is contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business 
the maturities of the company primary contractual cash obligations  as of december   are estimated to be as follows in millions  on an undiscounted basis total less than year years years after years on balance sheet insurance liabilities contractholder deposit funds future policy benefits global health care medical claims payable unpaid claims and claims expenses short term debt long term debt    other long term liabilities  off balance sheet purchase obligations operating leases total      as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective february   the company entered into a reinsurance agreement for its gmdb and gmib businesses 
the reinsurance premium due to berkshire of billion is not included in the contractual obligations table presented above 
in addition  the expected future cash flows for gmdb and gmib contracts included in the table above do not consider this reinsurance arrangement 
on balance sheet insurance liabilities 
contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities  excluding unearned premiums and fees  represent estimated net benefit payments for health  life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts 
recorded contractholder deposit funds reflect current fund balances primarily from universal life customers 
contractual cash obligations for these universal life contracts are estimated by projecting future payments using assumptions for lapse  withdrawal and mortality 
these projected future payments include estimated future interest crediting on cigna corporation form k 
back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees 
actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity  mortality  lapse  withdrawal  investment and premium experience 
the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of billion recorded on the balance sheet because the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting  charges and fees 
the company manages its investment portfolios to generate cash flows needed to satisfy contractual obligations 
any shortfall from expected investment yields could result in increases to recorded reserves and adversely impact results of operations 
the amounts associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses  as well as the reinsured workers compensation  personal accident and supplemental benefits businesses  are excluded from the table above as net cash flows associated with them are not expected to impact the company 
the total amount of these reinsured reserves excluded is approximately billion 
short term debt represents commercial paper  current maturities of long term debt  and current obligations under capital leases 
long term debt includes scheduled interest payments 
capital leases are included in long term debt and represent obligations for software licenses

estimated payments of million for deferred compensation  non qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year 
the company best estimate is that contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during will be approximately million 
the company expects to make payments subsequent to for these obligations  however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions which may materially differ from actual activities see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the above table also does not contain million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of their resolution with the respective taxing authorities

the company estimates fair values using prices from third parties or internal pricing methods 
fair value estimates received from third party pricing services are based on reported trade activity and quoted market prices when available  and other market information that a market participant may use to estimate fair value 
internal pricing methods are performed by the company investment professionals  and generally involve using discounted cash flow analyses  incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality  as well as other qualitative factors 
in instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments  fair value is estimated using methods  models and assumptions that the company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price 
these valuation techniques involve some level of estimation and judgment that becomes significant with increasingly complex instruments or pricing models 
the company is responsible for determining fair value  as well as the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements  based on the significance of unobservable inputs 
the company reviews methodologies and processes of third party pricing services and compares prices on a test basis to those obtained from other external pricing sources or internal estimates 
the company performs ongoing analyses of both prices received from third party pricing services and those developed internally to determine that they represent appropriate estimates of fair value 
these analyses include reviewing to ensure that prices do not become stale and whether changes from prior valuations are reasonable or require additional review 
the company also performs sample testing of sales values to confirm the accuracy of prior fair value estimates 
exceptions identified during these processes indicate that adjustments to prices are infrequent and do not significantly impact valuations

the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum 
these quality characteristics have not materially changed during the year

total commercial mortgage loans the company commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans  diversified by property type  location and borrower to reduce exposure to potential losses 
loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than of the property value at origination of the loan 
in addition to property value  debt service coverage  building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations 
property type  location  quality  and borrower are all important underwriting considerations as well 
the company holds no direct residential mortgage loans and generally does not securitize or service mortgage loans 
the company completed its annual in depth review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the second quarter of this review included an analysis of each property year end financial statements  rent rolls  operating plans and budgets for  a physical inspection of the property and other pertinent factors 
based on property values and cash flows estimated as part of this review and subsequent portfolio activity  the overall health of the portfolio improved from the review  consistent with recovery in many commercial real estate markets 
the portfolio average loan to value improved to at december   decreasing from as of december   due primarily to increased valuations for the majority of the underlying properties 
valuation changes varied by property type as office properties and apartments demonstrated the strongest recovery  hotel and retail properties showed modest improvement while industrial properties exhibited a decline  indicative of a slower recovery for rental rates and demand 
the portfolio average debt service coverage ratio was estimated to be at december   substantially higher than as of december   including improvement across all property types

back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations commercial real estate capital markets remain most active for well leased  quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets 
the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in the company mortgage portfolio possess these characteristics 
while commercial real estate fundamentals continued to improve  the improvement has varied across geographies and property types 
a broad recovery is dependent on continued improvement in the national economy 
the following table reflects the commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of december   summarized by loan to value ratio based on the annual loan review completed during the second quarter of loan to value distribution amortized cost of mortgage loans loan to value ratios senior subordinated total below to to to to to or above totals as summarized above  million or of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of subordinated notes that were fully underwritten and originated by the company using its standard underwriting procedures and are secured by first mortgage loans 
senior interests in these first mortgage loans were then sold to other institutional investors 
this strategy allowed the company to effectively utilize its origination capabilities to underwrite high quality loans  limit individual loan exposures  and achieve attractive risk adjusted yields 
in the event of a default  the company would pursue remedies up to and including foreclosure jointly with the holders of the senior interest  but would receive repayment only after satisfaction of the senior interest 
in the table above  there are two loans in the or above category with an aggregate carrying value of million that exceed the value of their underlying properties by million 
both of these loans have current debt service coverage of or greater  along with significant borrower commitment 
the commercial mortgage portfolio contains approximately loans 
four impaired loans with a carrying value of million are classified as problem or potential problem loans  including two loans totaling million that are current based on restructured terms and two loans totaling million  net of reserves  that are current but full collection of principal is not expected 
all of the remaining loans continue to perform under their contractual terms 
the company has million of loans maturing in the next twelve months 
given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate  positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment averaging nearly  the company remains confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under the contract terms 
other long term investments the company other long term investments include  million in security partnership and real estate funds as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures 
the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies securities partnerships and equity real estate 
given its subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities  the company assumes a higher level of risk for higher expected returns 
to mitigate risk  investments are diversified across approximately separate partnerships  and approximately general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships 
also  the funds underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type  and geographic region 
no single partnership investment exceeds of the company securities and real estate partnership portfolio 
although the total fair values of investments exceeded their carrying values as of december   the fair value of the company ownership interest in certain funds that are carried at cost was less than carrying value by million 
fund investment values continued to improve  but remained at depressed levels reflecting the impact of declines in value experienced predominantly during and due to economic weakness and disruption in the capital markets  particularly in the commercial real estate market 
the company expects to recover its carrying value over the average remaining life of these investments of approximately years 
given the current economic environment  future impairments are possible  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material effect on the company results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
problem and potential problem investments problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by days or more or have been restructured as to terms  which could include concessions by the company for modification of interest rate  principal payment or maturity date 
potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current no payment more than days past due  but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 
the characteristics management considers include  but are not limited to  the following request from the borrower for restructuring  principal or interest payments past due by more than but fewer than days  downgrade in credit rating  cigna corporation form k 
back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations collateral losses on asset backed securities  and for commercial mortgages  deterioration of debt service coverage below or value declines resulting in estimated loan to value ratios increasing to or more 
the company recognizes interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment 
the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant for or the following table shows problem and potential problem investments at amortized cost  net of valuation reserves and write downs december  december  in millions gross reserve net gross reserve net problem bonds problem commercial mortgage loans foreclosed real estate total problem investments potential problem bonds potential problem commercial mortgage loans total potential problem investments at december   included million and at december   included million of restructured loans classified in other long term investments that were previously reported in commercial mortgage loans 
net problem investments represent less than of total investments excluding policy loans at december  net problem investments decreased by million during  primarily due to a substantial paydown on a prior period problem mortgage loan and the subsequent reclassification of the remaining balance of that loan to good standing based on the results of the annual loan review completed during the second quarter of net potential problem investments represent less than of total investments excluding policy loans at december  net potential problem investments increased by million in  primarily due to the addition of two mortgage loans 
commercial mortgage loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not collect all amounts due according to the terms of the original loan agreement 
in the above table  problem and potential problem commercial mortgage loans totaling million net of valuation reserves at december   are considered impaired 
during  the company recorded a million pre tax million after tax increase to valuation reserves on impaired commercial mortgage loans

included in after tax realized investment gains losses were changes in valuation reserves related to commercial mortgage loans and other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities as follows in millions credit related other total credit related losses include other than temporary declines in fair value of fixed maturities and equity securities and changes in valuation reserves and asset write downs related to commercial mortgage loans and investments in real estate entities 
there were no credit losses on fixed maturities for which a portion of the impairment was recognized in other comprehensive income 
investment outlook the financial markets continue to be impacted by economic uncertainty in the united states and europe  however  asset values increased during  reflecting a decrease in market yields 
future realized and unrealized investment results will be impacted largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date 
these future conditions are not reasonably predictable 
management believes that the vast majority of the company fixed maturity investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms  and that declines in their fair values below carrying value are temporary 
based on the strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities  the company expects to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term 
future credit related losses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition or liquidity 
while management believes the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is positioned to perform well due to its solid aggregate loan to value ratio  strong debt service coverage and minimal underwater positions  broad commercial real estate market fundamentals continue to be under stress reflecting a slow economic recovery 
should these conditions remain for an extended period or worsen substantially  it could result in an increase in problem and potential problem loans 
given the current economic environment  future impairments are possible  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition or liquidity

back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk financial instruments the company assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
subsequent to the reinsurance transaction entered into on february  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed rate  medium term instruments 
changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and the company employee pension liabilities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the south korean won  euro  british pound  taiwan dollar  and turkish lira 
an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
equity price risk for domestic equity securities and the plan assets of the company employee pension plans 
the company management of market risks the company predominantly relies on three techniques to manage its exposure to market risk investment liability matching 
the company generally selects investment assets with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of its related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that the company can match the investments to its obligations 
shorter term investments support generally shorter term life and health liabilities 
medium term  fixed rate investments support interest sensitive and health liabilities 
longer term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long term disability liabilities 
use of local currencies for foreign operations 
the company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies 
while this technique does not reduce the company foreign currency exposure of its net assets  it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets 
use of derivatives 
the company generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks 
see notes c and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments 
effect of market fluctuations on the company the examples that follow illustrate the adverse effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including a hypothetical increase in market interest rates  primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans  partially offset by liabilities for long term debt and  in  gmib contracts  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar to foreign currencies  primarily for the net assets of foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency  and a hypothetical decrease in market prices for equity exposures  primarily for equity securities and  in  gmib contracts 
management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions  changes in the fair values of all insurance related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk  changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets have been excluded  consistent with the disclosure guidance  and changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill  deferred policy acquisition costs  taxes  and various accrued liabilities have been excluded  because they are not financial instruments  their primary risks are other than market risk 
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of the company financial instruments  subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities  would have been as follows as of december the effects of the gmib business are presented as though the company reinsurance agreement was effective as of december  loss in fair value market scenario for certain non insurance financial instruments in millions basis point increase in interest rates strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies decrease in market prices for equity exposures the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 
the impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at december  was greater than that cigna corporation form k 
back to contents part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at december  reflecting the reinsurance of the remaining net gmib liability in the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by the company was estimated to be of the us dollar equivalent fair value 
the company foreign operations hold investment assets  such as fixed maturities  cash  and cash equivalents  that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities 
due to the increase in the fair value of these investments in  that are primarily denominated in the south korean won  the effect of a hypothetical strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies at december  was greater than that effect at december  in  the primary effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was a decrease in the value of equity securities reported as investment assets because the equity exposures of the company gmib contracts were significantly reduced by the reinsurance agreement 
in  the effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was estimated based on a decrease in mutual fund values underlying gmib contracts and the equity futures contracts used to partially hedge these gmib equity exposures  as well as the value of equity securities held by the company 
as noted above  the company manages its exposures to market risk by matching investment characteristics to its obligations
