overview we are a growth oriented independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  development  and production of crude oil and natural gas in and around the denver julesburg basin d j basin of colorado 
substantially all of our producing wells are either in or adjacent to the wattenberg field  which has a history as one of the most prolific production areas in the country 
in addition to the approximately  net developed and undeveloped acres that we hold in the wattenberg field  we hold significant undeveloped acreage positions in i the northern extension area of the d j basin  ii in an area around yuma county that produces dry gas  and iii in western nebraska 
while we do not expect to devote significant resources to the exploration and development of our holdings outside of the wattenberg field in the near future  we recently participated in a well in yuma county that is producing dry gas and we expect to drill two test wells in the northern extension area 
since commencing active operations in september  we have undergone significant growth 
our growth was primarily driven by i our activities as an operator where we drill and complete productive oil and gas wells  ii our participation as a part owner in wells drilled by other operating companies  and iii our acquisition of producing oil wells from other individuals or companies 
as disclosed in the following table  as of august   we have completed  acquired  or participated in gross net successful oil and gas wells 
we have not drilled or participated in any dry holes 
productive wells operated wells non operated wells completed participated acquired total years ended gross net gross net gross net gross net august  august  august  august  august  total in addition to the wells that had reached productive status as of august   we were the operator of seven horizontal wells in progress  including five wells on the renfroe prospect that commenced production during the first week of september  and we were participating as a non operator in nine gross one net wells that were in various stages of the drilling or completion process 
wells in progress represent wells during the period of time between spud date and date of first production 
generally  horizontal wells are expected to require to days to drill  complete and connect to the gathering system 
all of the wells in progress at august   are expected to commence production during our first or second fiscal quarter of as of august   we were the operator of wells that were producing oil and gas and we were participating as a non operating working interest owner in producing wells  held approximately  gross acres and  net acres under lease  had estimated proved reserves of million barrels bbls of oil and billion cubic feet bcf of gas  on a boe basis  increased our estimated proved reserves by during fiscal  and on a pv basis  increased our estimated proved reserves by during fiscal our basic strategy for continued growth includes additional drilling activities and acquisition of existing wells in well defined areas that provide significant cash flow and rapid return on investment 
we attempt to maximize our return on assets by drilling in low risk areas and by operating wells in which we have a majority net revenue interest 
our drilling efforts are focused on the wattenberg field as it yields consistent results 
until  all of our wells were low risk vertical wells 
during  we began to participate with other operators in horizontal wells 
the success of those wells  as well as the success of numerous other horizontal wells drilled in this area  convinced us to shift our strategy from vertical wells to horizontal wells 
during  we spent the first half of the year drilling vertical wells and spent the second half of the year drilling horizontal wells 
our plans for contemplate drilling or participating in horizontal wells 
our horizontal wells will primarily target the niobrara and codell formations 
historically  our cash flow from operations was not sufficient to fund our growth plans and we relied on proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities 
our cash flow from operations is increasing  and we plan to finance an increasing percentage of our growth with internally generated funds 
ultimately  implementation of our growth plans will be dependent upon the success of our operations and the amount of financing we are able to obtain 
results of operations material changes of certain items in our statements of operations included in our financial statements for the periods presented are discussed below 
for the year ended august   compared to the year ended august for the year ended august   we reported net income of million  or per basic share  per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share for the period ended august  the decline in net income for reflects significant non cash charges for an unrealized loss of million on our commodity derivatives and a provision for deferred income taxes of million 
there was an improvement in operating income  which increased from million in to million 
our improvement in operating profitability was driven by our successful drilling program and integration of producing wells added in the orr energy acquisition 
the significant variances between the two years were primarily caused by increased revenues and expenses associated with a greater number of producing wells 
the following discussion expands upon significant items of inflow and outflow that affected results of operations oil and gas production and revenues for the year ended august   we recorded total revenues of million compared to million for the year ended august   an increase of million or 
we experienced an overall annual increase in production quantities from the prior year having realized a full year of production from wells at the beginning of the year  and the addition of wells  including new wells drilled as well as those acquired with the december orr energy acquisition 
years ended august  production oil bbls gas mcf total production in boe revenues in thousands oil gas total average sales price oil bbls gas mcf boe bbl refers to one stock tank barrel  or us gallons liquid volume in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons 
mcf refers to one thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
boe refers to barrel of oil equivalent  which combines bbls of oil and mcf of gas by converting each six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil 
as of august   we owned interests in producing wells 
net oil and gas production averaged  boe per day in  as compared with  boe per day for  a year over year increase of in boepd production 
the significant increase in production from the prior year reflects additional wells that went into productive status during and a full year of production from the wells that were added over the course of fiscal year production for the fourth fiscal quarter of averaged  boe per day 
revenues are sensitive to changes in commodity prices 
from to  our realized annual average sales price per barrel of oil decreased  however  we experienced an increase of in our realized annual average sales price per mcf of natural gas 
overall on a boe basis  of the increase in oil and gas revenues was attributed to increased volumes and was attributed to the increase of boe prices received 
lease operating expenses loe and production taxes direct operating costs of producing oil and natural gas and taxes on production and properties are summarized as follows in thousands years ended august  lease operating expenses lifting costs work over total loe loe per boe years ended august  production taxes severance and ad valorem taxes production taxes per boe lease operating and work over costs tend to fluctuate with the number of producing wells  and  to a lesser extent  on variations in oil field service costs and changes in the production mix of crude oil and natural gas 
from to  we experienced an increase in production cost per boe in connection with additional costs to bolster output from some of our older wells 
taxes  the largest component of lease operating expenses  generally move with the value of oil and gas sold 
as a percent of revenues  taxes averaged in and depletion  depreciation and amortization dda the following table summarizes the components of dda 
depletion expense more than doubled  primarily as a result of growth in production and producing properties from to years ended august  in thousands depletion depreciation and amortization total dda dda expense per boe capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties are depleted quarterly using the units of production method based on estimated reserves  wherein the ratio of production volumes for the quarter to beginning of quarter estimated total reserves determine the depletion rate 
for fiscal year  our depletable reserve base was  boe 
fiscal year production represented of the reserve base 
depletion expense per boe increased from to for the fiscal year ended august   depletion of oil and gas properties was per boe compared to for the fiscal year ended august  the increase in the dd a rate was primarily the result of the allocation of the purchase price to proved properties related to the december acquisition of orr energy 
acquired proved reserves are valued at fair market value on the date of the acquisition  which contributes to a higher amortization base  as compared to our historical cost of acquiring leaseholds and developing our properties 
to date  the fair value of our acquired reserves has been higher than our historical cost of developing our properties even though the resulting eurs are equivalent 
therefore  the increase in the ratio of costs subject to amortization to the reserves acquired is greater than our internally developed properties 
we believe that  although initially acquisitions increase our dd a rate per boe over the development of the acquired properties  the resulting rates will decline with the drilling of horizontal wells and the addition of the related reserves 
general and administrative g a the following table summarizes general and administration expenses incurred and capitalized during the last two years years ended august  in thousands g a costs incurred capitalized costs total g a g a expense per boe general and administrative includes all overhead costs associated with employee compensation and benefits  insurance  facilities  professional fees  and regulatory costs  among others 
in an effort to minimize overhead costs  we employ a total staff of employees  and use consultants  advisors  and contractors to perform certain tasks when it is cost effective 
we maintain our corporate office in platteville  co partially to avoid higher rents in other areas 
although g a costs have increased as we grow the business we strive to maintain an efficient overhead structure 
for the fiscal year ended august   g a was per boe compared to for the fiscal year ended august  our g a expense for includes share based compensation of  the comparable amount for was  share based compensation includes a calculated value for stock options or shares of common stock that we grant for compensatory purposes 
it is a non cash charge  which  for stock options  is calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options 
amounts are pro rated over the vesting terms of the option agreement  generally three to five years 
pursuant to the requirements under the full cost accounting method for oil and gas properties  we identify all general and administrative costs that relate directly to the acquisition of undeveloped mineral leases and the development of properties 
those costs are reclassified from general and administrative expenses and capitalized into the full cost pool 
the increase in capitalized costs from to reflects our increasing activities to acquire leases and develop the properties 
other income expense neither interest expense nor interest income had a significant impact on our results of operations for substantially all of the interest costs incurred under our credit facility were classified as costs related to our unevaluated assets or wells in progress and were eligible for capitalization into the full cost pool 
beginning in  we entered into commodity derivative contracts for the future sale of oil 
we designed our derivative activity to protect our cash flow during periods of oil price declines 
using swaps and collars  we have hedged  barrels of future production for the next months 
generally  contracts are based upon a reference price indexed to trading of west texas intermediate crude oil on the nymex 
during the year ended august   the average index prices were higher than our average contract prices  and we realized a loss of million for the year 
as of august   the weighted average future index prices were per barrel  approximately higher than our contract price  creating an unrealized loss of million at the end of the year 
our commodity derivative contracts are revalued at fair value for each reporting period  and changes in the value of the contracts can have a significant impact on reported results of operations income taxes we reported income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended august  all of the tax liability will be deferred into future years  and it does not appear that any federal or state payments will be required for during  we reported a net deferred tax benefit of  essentially representing a future refund  to record the benefit arising from the net operating loss carry forward nol 
for tax purposes  we have a nol of million which will begin to expire  if not utilized  in year for book purposes  the nol is million  as there is a difference of million related to deductions for stock based compensation 
for  we reported an effective tax rate of 
our estimated effective tax rate for future periods  based upon current tax laws  is 
the difference reflects several differences between book income and tax income  including adjustments for statutory depletion and an adjustment to the stock based compensation component included in our inventory of deferred tax assets 
during  we reversed the timing difference created for the future deduction of stock based compensation when the underlying options expired 
potential tax deductions for compensation are eliminated whenever options expire without exercise 
each year  management evaluates all the positive and negative evidence regarding our tax position and reaches a conclusion on the most likely outcome 
during and  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a benefit from the net operating loss carry forward  and in we eliminated our entire valuation allowance of million 
prior to  management concluded that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  a full valuation allowance was provided against the net deferred tax asset 
for the year ended august   compared to the year ended august for the year ended august   we reported net income of million  or per share  per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share for the period ended august  our rapid improvement in profitability was driven by our successful drilling program 
the significant variances between the two years are i increased revenues and expenses associated with more producing wells  ii the cessation of certain interest and other non cash expenses  and iii the effect of income taxes 
as further explained below  our net loss for resulted from non cash charges related to the convertible promissory notes and the derivative conversion liability 
the following discussion also expands upon items of inflow and outflow that affect operating income 
oil and gas production and revenues for the year ended august   we recorded total revenues of million compared to million for the year ended august   an increase of million or 
we experienced an overall annual increase in production from the prior year having realized a full year of production from wells at the beginning of the year  and the addition of wells  including new wells drilled as well as those acquired 
although there was significant commodity price fluctuation during the year  overall pricing on a boe basis was not significantly different from to for the fiscal year ended august   our gas oil ratio gor on a boe basis was compared to for the fiscal year ended august  years ended august  production oil bbls gas mcf total production in boe revenues in thousands oil gas total average sales price oil bbls gas mcf boe bbl refers to one stock tank barrel  or us gallons liquid volume in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons 
mcf refers to one thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
boe refers to barrel of oil equivalent  which combines bbls of oil and mcf of gas by converting each six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil 
as of august   we had producing wells 
net oil and gas production averaged  boe per day in  as compared with boe per day for  a year over year increase of in boepd production 
the significant increase in production from the prior year reflects additional wells that went into productive status since august  and a full year of production from the wells that were added over the course of fiscal year production for the fourth fiscal quarter of averaged  boe per day 
revenues are sensitive to changes in commodity prices 
from to  our realized annual average sales price per barrel of oil rose  however  we experienced a decline of in our realized annual average sales price per mcf of natural gas 
there was a and swing in the price of crude and natural gas from the respective low to high prices during the twelve month period ended august  barrel and mcf prices at year end were up and down  respectively  from twelve month average 
we did not utilize any commodity price hedges during either year  but expect to do so in the future 
while our balanced production mix of oil and gas and the high liquid content of our gas help to mitigate the negative effect of volatility in commodity prices  downward price pressure could have a negative effect on revenues reported in future periods 
lease operating expenses loe and production taxes direct operating costs of producing oil and natural gas and taxes on production and properties are reported as lease operating expenses as follows years ended august  in thousands production costs work over other lifting cost severance and ad valorem taxes total loe per boe production costs work over other lifting cost severance and ad valorem taxes total loe per boe lease operating and work over costs tend to fluctuate with the number of producing wells  and  to a lesser extent  on variations in oil field service costs and changes in the production mix of crude oil and natural gas 
from to  we experienced an increase in production cost per boe in connection with additional costs to bolster output from some of our older wells 
taxes  the largest component of lease operating expenses  generally move with the value of oil and gas sold 
as a percent of revenues  taxes averaged in both and depletion  depreciation and amortization dda the following table summarizes the components of dda 
depletion expense more than doubled  primarily as a result of growth in production and producing properties from to years ended august  in thousands depletion depreciation and amortization total dda dda expense per boe capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties are depleted quarterly using the units of production method based on estimated reserves  wherein the ratio of production volumes for the quarter to beginning of quarter estimated total reserves determine the depletion rate 
for fiscal year  our depletable reserve base was  barrels of oil and  mcf of natural gas 
fiscal year production represented and of those reserve bases  respectively 
depletion expense per boe declined from to for the fiscal year ended august   depletion of oil and gas properties was per boe compared to for the fiscal year ended august  during  we have been able to increase reserves and production faster than the increase in capitalized costs  which caused the decline in the expense per boe 
general and administrative g a the following table summarizes the components of general and administration expenses years ended august  in thousands cash based compensation share based compensation professional fees insurance other general and administrative capitalized general and administrative total g a g a expense per boe although g a costs increased during  they increased at a lower rate than the overall growth of our business  as we strive to maintain an efficient overhead structure 
for the fiscal year ended august   g a was per boe compared to for the fiscal year ended august  cash based compensation and benefits include payments to employees and directors 
share based compensation is associated with compensation in the form of either stock options or common stock grants for employees  directors  and service providers 
the amount of expense recorded for stock options is calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing model  while the amount of expense recorded for common stock grants is calculated based upon the closing market value of the shares on the date of grant 
professional fees have increased as we have grown our business 
the two primary factors driving this increase are the additional accounting and auditing fees incurred in connection with operating as a public company  and the additional professional services required to meet the compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  as we have progressed from a smaller reporting company to an accelerated filer under sec definitions 
the listing on the nyse mkt contributed to costs in excess of those reported in the comparable prior year period when our stock was listed on the otc bulletin board 
pursuant to the requirements under the full cost accounting method for oil and gas properties  we identify all general and administrative costs that relate directly to the acquisition of undeveloped mineral leases and the development of properties 
those costs are reclassified from general and administrative expenses and capitalized into the full cost pool 
the increase in capitalized costs from to reflects our increasing activities to acquire leases and develop the properties 
operating income loss for the year ended august   we generated operating income of million  compared to million for the year ended august  this tri fold increase in operating income resulted primarily from the increasing contribution of wells brought into production during the last two years  which includes wells drilled under the and drilling programs  the acquisition of producing properties from pem and other parties  and increased production from older wells that were recompleted using newer hydraulic fracturing techniques 
increased revenues more than offset increased costs incurred by us to accomplish these objectives 
other income expense other income for the fiscal year ended august  was  consisting solely of interest income 
interest cost of  was incurred during  all of which was capitalized as part of the cost of oil and gas properties 
for the fiscal year ended august   we reported several significant items of expense in addition to interest income of  these other expenses reported in primarily related to our convertible promissory notes  including net interest expense of  accretion of debt discount of million  amortization of debt issuance costs of million  and a change in the fair value of the derivative conversion liability of million 
during  interest expense was also recorded on the related party note and the bank line of credit in the amounts of  and  respectively 
of these expenses  we capitalized interest and amortization of  the convertible promissory notes contained a conversion feature which was considered an embedded derivative and recorded as a liability at its initial estimated fair value 
this derivative conversion liability was then marked to market over time  with the resulting change in fair value recorded as a non cash item in the statement of operations 
all expenses related to the convertible promissory notes ceased mid year  as all noteholders converted their holdings into equity 
income taxes we reported income tax expense of million offset by a tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended august   resulting in a net income tax benefit of  and a corresponding net deferred tax asset in the same amount 
for all reporting periods prior to  no income tax expense or benefit was reported  as all tax assets or liabilities were effectively offset by a valuation allowance 
the income tax benefit is a one time event representing the expected value of the future deduction of the net operating loss carry forward generated during our start up years 
each year  management evaluates all the positive and negative evidence regarding our tax position and reaches a conclusion on the most likely outcome 
during the current fiscal year  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a benefit from the net operating loss carry forward  and we eliminated our entire valuation allowance of million 
prior to  management concluded that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  a full valuation allowance was provided against the net deferred tax asset 
during management concluded that positive indicators outweighed negative indicators and that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance 
although we reported net losses every year since inception through august   we attributed all of the net losses for the and fiscal years to a single discrete item 
the discrete item was the fair value accounting treatment of the components of the convertible promissory notes issued in  which created non cash expenses for accretion of debt discount  amortization of issuance costs  and change in fair value of derivative liability 
as all of the convertible notes were converted  those expenses will not recur  and it is appropriate to exclude them from a consideration of future profitability 
secondly  we had begun to report net income and had significantly increased oil and gas reserve values 
lastly  we completed a debt financing arrangement and an equity financing arrangement that allowed us to continue with our operating plan 
accordingly  we believed that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset created by the net operating loss carryover 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity since inception has been net cash provided by sales and other issuances of equity and debt securities 
our secondary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of properties  and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
our primary use of capital has been for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available to us 
we believe that cash on hand plus cash flows from operations plus available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity 
however  unforeseen events may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we have on file with the sec an effective universal shelf registration statement that we may use for future securities offerings 
terms of future financings may be unfavorable  and we cannot assure investors that funding will be available on acceptable terms 
during the year  we completed the sale of common stock for net proceeds of million 
the underwritten offering  which closed on june   was comprised of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share 
in november  we modified our borrowing arrangements 
the new revolving line of credit increases the maximum lending commitment to million  subject to the limitations of a borrowing base calculation 
the bank group providing the facility is led by community banks of colorado  a division of nbh bank  na 
the arrangement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the payment of dividends and require compliance with certain financial ratios 
the borrowing arrangement is collateralized by certain of our assets  including producing properties 
the maximum lending commitment is subject to reduction based upon a borrowing base calculation  which will be re determined semi annually using updated reserve reports 
based upon the semi annual redetermination derived from the february  reserve report  the borrowing base was increased from million to million 
in december  we utilized a portion of the financing available through this arrangement to fund the acquisition of assets from orr energy 
we currently have approximately million available for future borrowings if needed 
additional borrowings  if any  are expected to be used to fund acquisitions  expenditures for well drilling and development  and to provide working capital 
interest on our revolving line of credit accrues at a variable rate  which will equal or exceed the minimum rate of 
the interest rate pricing grid contains a graduated escalation in applicable margin for increased utilization 
at our option  interest rates will be referenced to the prime rate plus a margin of to  or the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of to 
the maturity date for the arrangement is november  we engage in the use of commodity derivatives in connection with anticipated crude oil sales to mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility 
during the year ended august   we realized a cash loss from commodity derivatives of million 
at august   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  and an outstanding balance of million under our revolving credit facility 
our sources and uses of funds for the fiscal years ended august   and  are summarized below in thousands years ended august  cash provided by operations capital expenditures property conveyances cash used by other investing activities cash provided by equity financing activities net borrowings net increase in cash and equivalents net cash provided by operations has improved during each of the last three years 
the significant improvement reflects the operating contribution from new wells that were drilled and producing wells that were acquired 
capital expenditures reported in the statement of cash flows are calculated on a strict cash basis  which differs from the all inclusive basis used to calculate other amounts reported in our financial statements 
specifically  cash payments for acquisition of property and equipment as reflected in the statement of cash flows excludes non cash capital expenditures and includes an adjustment plus or minus to reflect the timing of when the capital expenditure obligations are incurred and when the actual cash payment is made 
a reconciliation of the differences between cash payments and the all inclusive amounts is summarized in the following table in thousands years ended august  cash payments for capital expenditures accrued costs  beginning of period accrued costs  end of period non cash acquisitions  common stock non cash acquisitions  debt financing other all inclusive capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended august   we engaged in drilling or completion activities on wells 
in addition  we invested million in the acquisition of mineral assets from orr energy 
approximately million of our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended august   represent drilling and completion cost on wells on which production commenced during the year 
as of august   we had recorded costs of million on wells in progress 
our mineral lease acquisition program incurred costs of million during the year  million of which were acquired in exchange for our common stock 
our primary need for cash for the fiscal year ending august   will be to fund our drilling and acquisition programs 
our cash requirements are expected to increase significantly as we implement our horizontal drilling program 
each horizontal well is estimated to cost million  compared to the estimated cost of a vertical well of million 
under the preliminary plans for our capital budget  we estimate capital expenditures of approximately million  consisting of drilling and completion costs for wells which we operate  our pro rata share of the costs on wells drilled by other operators  and the costs of acquiring properties 
it is our plan to drill net horizontal wells during the year and to participate in net non operated horizontal wells at a total cost of million 
we expect to drill or participate in vertical wells 
leasing activities are expected to cost million  and the acquisition of producing properties is budgeted for million 
our capital expenditure estimate is subject to adjustment for drilling success  acquisition opportunities  operating cash flow  and available capital resources 
the amount  timing and allocation of capital expenditures is generally within our control  as participations are a limited portion of our operations 
fluctuations in prices for oil and natural gas could cause us to defer or accelerate our spending 
we plan to generate profits by producing oil and natural gas from wells that we drill or acquire 
for the near term  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our needs 
however  to meet all of our long term goals  we may need to raise some of the funds required to drill new wells through the sale of our securities  from loans from third parties or from third parties willing to pay our share of drilling and completing the wells 
we may not be successful in raising the capital needed to drill or acquire oil or gas wells 
any wells which may be drilled by us may not produce oil or gas in commercial quantities 
for  we believe that the cash flow from operations plus proceeds from the sale of common stock during june plus additional borrowings available under our revolving line of credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs during the fiscal year contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of august  in thousands less than one year one to three years three to five years total rig contract revolving credit facility operating leases employment agreements total as of august   we had agreed with ensign united states drilling  inc to use one drilling rig to drill a total of wells 
as of august   six wells had been drilled 
we estimate that we will utilize the rig through june  total payments due to ensign will depend upon a number of variables  including the target formations and other technical details 
we estimate that the total commitment for the wells will approximate million and that the portion of the obligation to be recorded during fiscal will approximate million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonable likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
non gaap financial measures we use adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure for internal managerial purposes  when evaluating period to period comparisons 
this measure is not a measure of financial performance under us gaap and should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  cash flows from operations  investing  or financing activities  nor as a liquidity measure or indicator of cash flows reported in accordance with us gaap 
the non gaap financial measure that we use may not be comparable to measures with similar titles reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below for a detailed description of this measure as well as a reconciliation to the nearest us gaap measure 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income adjusted to exclude the impact of interest expense  interest income  income tax expense  dda depreciation  depletion and amortization  stock based compensation  and the plus or minus change in fair value of derivative assets or liabilities 
we believe adjusted ebitda is relevant because it is a measure of cash flow available to fund our capital expenditures and service our debt and is a widely used industry metric which may provide comparability of our results with our peers 
the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to its nearest gaap measure 
years ended august  adjusted ebitda net income loss depreciation  depletion and amortization change in fair value of derivative conversion liability provision for income tax stock based compensation commodity derivative change interest expense interest income adjusted ebitda trend and outlook in early september   northern colorado experienced flooding that covered a wide area and caused extensive damage 
significant damage was done to the area s infrastructure  such as roads  bridges  and water treatment facilities  as well as to numerous structures within the flood zone 
approximately of our well sites were directly affected by the flood waters 
however  the damage to our facilities was not severe  and there were no hydrocarbon spills at our sites 
most of the wells were repaired within a few weeks and all of the sites are expected to return to service during our first fiscal quarter 
the cost of repairs will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
however  the extent of the flooding throughout our production area was so vast that it impacted our daily operations  even on well sites that were not directly affected by the flood 
for several days  it was difficult to gather and transport hydrocarbons  and sales from our legacy vertical wells for the month of september decreased by from the month of august 
the new horizontal wells which reached productive status during the first week of september were less affected by the flood  and production from those wells is expected to meet our initial expectations for the quarter 
during fiscal year  the wattenberg field experienced elevated line pressure in the natural gas and liquids gathering system 
issues with high line pressure continued during high line pressure restricts our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas 
as line pressures increase  it becomes more difficult to inject gas produced by our wells into the pipeline 
when line pressure is greater than the operating pressure of our wellhead equipment  the wellhead equipment is unable to inject gas into the pipeline  and our production is restricted or shut in 
since our wells produce a mixture of crude oil and natural gas  restrictions in gas production also restrict oil production 
although various factors can cause increased line pressure  a significant factor in our area is the success of horizontal wells that have recently been drilled 
as new horizontal wells come on line with increased pressures and volumes  they produce more gas than the gathering system was designed to handle 
once a pipeline is at capacity  pressures increase and older wells with less natural pressure are not able to compete with the new wells 
the pace of horizontal drilling in the wattenberg is accelerating and it appears that it will be some time before the gathering system will have sufficient capacity to eliminate the high line pressure issues 
we are taking steps to mitigate high line pressures 
where it was cost beneficial  we installed compressors to aid the wellhead equipment in its injection of gas into the system 
compression equipment at the wellhead has proven beneficial  especially at pad sites with multiple vertical wells 
along with our mid stream service provider  we are evaluating the installation of larger diameter pipe to improve the gas gathering capacity 
in addition  companies that operate the gas gathering pipelines are making significant capital investments to increase system capacity 
as publicly disclosed  dcp midstream partners dcp is currently implementing a multi year facility expansion capable of significantly increasing the long term gathering and processing capacity in the wattenberg field 
dcp is the principle third party provider that we employ to gather production from our wells 
a significant improvement in the system will occur as a new processing plant in lasalle  co comes on line 
the lasalle  co plant will have an estimated capacity of million cubic feet per day 
the grand opening for the lasalle plant was held in october  and the plant is expected to reach full operational status during our first and second fiscal quarters 
dcp has also announced the building of the lucerne plant ii  northeast of greeley in weld county  with a maximum capacity of mmcf d  which is estimated to begin operations in at this time  we do not know how long it will take for the mitigation efforts to remedy the problem 
other factors that will most significantly affect our results of operations include i activities on properties that we operate  ii the marketability of our production  iii our ability to satisfy our substantial capital requirements  iv completion of acquisitions of additional properties and reserves  v competition from larger companies and vi prices for oil and gas 
our revenues will also be significantly impacted by our ability to maintain or increase oil or gas production through exploration and development activities 
it is expected that our principal source of cash flow will be from the production and sale of oil and gas reserves which are depleting assets 
cash flow from the sale of oil and gas production depends upon the quantity of production and the price obtained for the production 
an increase in prices will permit us to finance our operations to a greater extent with internally generated funds  may allow us to obtain equity financing from more sources or on better terms  and lessens the difficulty of obtaining financing 
however  price increases heighten the competition for oil and gas prospects  increase the costs of exploration and development  and  because of potential price declines  increase the risks associated with the purchase of producing properties during times that prices are at higher levels 
a decline in oil and gas prices i will reduce our cash flow which in turn will reduce the funds available for exploring and replacing oil and gas reserves  ii will potentially reduce our current loc borrowing base capacity and increase the difficulty of obtaining equity and debt financing and worsen the terms on which such financing may be obtained  iii will reduce the number of oil and gas prospects which have reasonable economic terms  iv may cause us to permit leases to expire based upon the value of potential oil and gas reserves in relation to the costs of exploration  and v may result in marginally productive oil and gas wells being abandoned as non commercial 
however  price declines reduce the competition for oil and gas properties and correspondingly reduce the prices paid for leases and prospects 
other than the foregoing  we do not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that will have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our sales  revenues or expenses critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following paragraphs provide a discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for a detailed discussion of the nature of our accounting practices and additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas sales we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced crude oil and natural gas 
revenues from production on properties in which we share an economic interest with other owners are recognized on the basis of our interest 
revenues are reported on a gross basis for the amounts received before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
revenue is recorded and receivables are accrued using the sales method  which occurs in the month production is delivered to the purchaser  at which time ownership of the oil is transferred to the purchaser 
payment is generally received between thirty and ninety days after the date of production 
provided that reasonable estimates can be made  revenue and receivables are accrued to recognize delivery of product to the purchaser 
differences between estimates and actual volumes and prices  if any  are adjusted upon final settlement 
oil and gas reserves oil and gas reserves represent theoretical  estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which  using geological and engineering data  are estimated with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond our control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are different from the future quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves 
the determination of depletion and amortization expenses  as well as the ceiling test calculation related to the recorded value of our oil and natural gas properties  is highly dependent on estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas reserves including the costs of unsuccessful efforts are capitalized into a single full cost pool 
these costs include land acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expense  carrying charges on non producing properties  costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities 
under the full cost method  no gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of oil and gas properties unless non recognition of such gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and gas reserves 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are depleted using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved reserves 
for depletion purposes  the volume of petroleum reserves and production is converted into a common unit of measure at the energy equivalent conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil 
investments in unevaluated properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
asset retirement obligations aro we are subject to legal and contractual obligations to reclaim  remediate  or otherwise restore properties at the time the asset is permanently removed from service 
calculation of an aro requires estimates about several future events  including the life of the asset  the costs to remove the asset from service  and inflation factors 
the aro is initially estimated based upon discounted cash flows over the life of the asset and is accreted to full value over time using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
estimates are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes 
the present value of a liability for the aro is initially recorded when it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
this is typically when a well is completed or an asset is placed in service 
when the aro is initially recorded  we capitalize the cost asset retirement cost or arc by increasing the carrying value of the related asset 
arcs related to wells are capitalized to the full cost pool and subject to depletion 
over time  the liability increases for the change in its present value accretion of aro  while the capitalized cost decreases over the useful life of the asset  recognized as depletion 
stock based compensation we recognize all equity based compensation as stock based compensation expense  included in general and administrative expenses  based on the fair value of the compensation measured at the grant date 
the expense is recognized over the vesting period of the grant 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recorded for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes using the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax loss and credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we provide for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards when realization is more likely than not 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized  the balance of net deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider many factors in our evaluation of deferred tax assets  including the following sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a portion or all of a tax benefit for deductible timing differences and carry forwards future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years  if permitted  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards 
recent accounting pronouncements we evaluate the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations to determine the impact of new pronouncements on us gaap and their impact on us 
in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this asu requires us to disclose both net and gross information about assets and liabilities that have been offset  if any  and the related arrangements 
the disclosures under this new guidance are required to be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we are required to implement this guidance effective for the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 
various other accounting standards updates recently issued  most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable to specific industries  and are not expected to a have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk our primary market risk exposure results from the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity pricing for our production is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable in recent years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the foreseeable future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control  including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable commodity index price 
interest rate risk at august   we had debt outstanding under our bank credit facility totaling million 
interest on our bank credit facility accrues at a variable rate  based upon either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
at august   the interest rate was  based upon libor plus a margin of 
we are currently incurring interest at a rate of  and we are exposed to interest rate risk on the bank credit facility if the variable reference rates increase 
if interest rates increase  our interest expense would increase and our available cash flow would decrease 
counterparty risk effective january   we entered into commodity derivative agreements 
these derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks 
we seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to long standing and established counterparties 
we are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of the agreement 
we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by counterparties to our derivative financial instruments 
there can be no assurance  however  that our practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk 
the failure of any of the counterparties to our commodity derivative arrangements to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows
