business strategy our goal is to grow revenues and earnings and deliver returns in excess of our cost of capital by providing high quality original equipment and replacement products to the engine management and temperature control markets 
the key elements of our strategy are as follows maintain our strong competitive position in the engine management and temperature control businesses 
we are one of the leading independent manufacturers serving north america and other geographic areas in our core businesses of engine management and temperature control 
we believe that our success is attributable to our emphasis on product quality  the breadth and depth of our product lines for both domestic and import vehicles  and our reputation for outstanding customer service 
to maintain our strong competitive position in our markets  we remain committed to the following providing our customers with broad lines of high quality engine management and temperature control products  supported by the highest level of customer service and reliability  continuing to maximize our production  supply chain and distribution efficiencies  continuing to improve our cost position through increased global sourcing and increased manufacturing in low cost countries  and 
index focusing on our engineering development efforts including a focus on bringing more product manufacturing in house 
provide superior customer service  product availability and technical support 
our goal is to increase sales to existing and new customers by leveraging our skills in rapidly filling orders  maintaining high levels of product availability  providing insightful customer category management  and providing technical support in a cost effective manner 
in addition  our category management and technically skilled sales force professionals provide product selection  assortment and application support to our customers 
expand our product lines 
we intend to increase our sales by continuing to develop internally  or through potential acquisitions  the range of engine management and temperature control products that we offer to our customers 
we are committed to investing the resources necessary to maintain and expand our technical capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies 
broaden our customer base 
our goal is to increase our customer base by a continuing to leverage our manufacturing capabilities to secure additional original equipment business globally with automotive  industrial  marine  military and heavy duty vehicle and equipment manufacturers and their service part operations as well as our existing customer base including traditional warehouse distributors  large retailers  other manufacturers and export customers  and b supporting the service part operations of vehicle and equipment manufacturers with value added services and product support for the life of the part 
improve operating efficiency and cost position 
our management places significant emphasis on improving our financial performance by achieving operating efficiencies and improving asset utilization  while maintaining product quality and high customer order fill rates 
we intend to continue to improve our operating efficiency and cost position by increasing cost effective vertical integration in key product lines through internal development  focusing on integrated supply chain management and customer collaboration initiatives  relocating manufacturing to our low cost off shore plants  maintaining and improving our cost effectiveness and competitive responsiveness to better serve our customer base  including sourcing certain materials and products from low cost countries such as those in asia  enhancing company wide programs geared toward manufacturing and distribution efficiency  and focusing on company wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction programs  such as closing excess facilities and consolidating redundant functions 
cash utilization 
we intend to apply any excess cash flow from operations and the management of working capital primarily to reduce our outstanding indebtedness  pay dividends to our shareholders  repurchase shares of our common stock  expand our product lines and grow revenues through potential acquisitions 
the automotive aftermarket the automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization and size 
in addition to manufacturing  aftermarket companies allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process and product engineering in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend 
aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes and do not have to provide systems engineering support 
aftermarket manufacturers also must distribute  with rapid turnaround times  products for a full range of vehicles on the road 
the primary customers of the automotive aftermarket manufacturers are national and regional warehouse distributors  large retail chains  automotive repair chains and the dealer service networks of original equipment manufacturers oems 

index the automotive aftermarket industry differs substantially from the oem supply business 
unlike the oem supply business that primarily follows trends in new car production  the automotive aftermarket industry s performance primarily tends to follow different trends  such as growth in number of vehicles on the road  increase in average vehicle age  change in total miles driven per year  new and modified environmental regulations  including fuel efficiency standards  increase in pricing of new cars  economic and financial market conditions  new car quality and related warranties  change in vehicle scrap rates  and change in average fuel prices 
during periods of economic decline or weakness  more automobile owners may choose to repair their current automobiles using replacement parts rather than purchasing a new automobile  which benefits the automotive aftermarket industry  including suppliers like us 
recent global economic and financial market conditions adversely affected the volume of new cars and truck sales  which may have benefited the automotive aftermarket 
traditionally  the parts manufacturers of oems and the independent manufacturers who supply the original equipment oe part applications have supplied a majority of the business to new car dealer networks 
however  certain parts manufacturers have become more independent and are no longer affiliated with oems  which has provided  and may continue to provide  opportunities for us to supply replacement parts to the dealer service networks of the oems  both for warranty and out of warranty repairs 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
inventory management 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications and or the result of installer error 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
we accrue for overstock returns as a percentage of sales  after giving consideration to recent returns history 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  we have in place procedures for authorized warranty returns  including for warranty returns which result from installer error  placed restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program to better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  which are our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not provide acceptable proof that complete air conditioning system repair was performed 

index discounts  allowances  and incentives 
in connection with our sales activities  we offer a variety of usual customer discounts  allowances and incentives 
first  we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discount terms of the invoice 
second  we offer pricing discounts based on volume and different product lines purchased from us 
these discounts are principally in the form of off invoice discounts and are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale 
for those customers that choose to receive a payment on a quarterly basis instead of off invoice  we accrue for such payments as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly 
finally  rebates and discounts are provided to customers as advertising and sales force allowances  and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we account for these discounts and allowances as a reduction to revenues  and record them when sales are recorded

assets held under capitalized leases are included in property  plant and equipment and depreciated over the lives of the respective leases or over their economic useful lives  whichever is less 
in order to reduce our accounts receivable balances and improve our cash flow  we sell undivided interests in certain of our receivables to financial institutions 
we entered these agreements at our discretion when we determined that the cost of factoring was less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing debt

restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility prohibited any such further purchases in we anticipate that our present sources of funds  including funds from operations and additional borrowings  will continue to be adequate to meet our financing needs over the next twelve months 
we continue to evaluate alternative sources to further improve the liquidity of our business 
the timing  terms  size and pricing of any alternative sources of financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
in addition  we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could  among other things  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations  limit our ability to pay future dividends  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our indebtedness instead of for funding working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
if we default on any of our indebtedness  or breach any financial covenant in our revolving credit facility  our business could be adversely affected 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  and expiration dates of commitments through in thousands total lease obligations postretirement and pension benefits severance payments related to restructuring and integration total commitments indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities of million as of december  is not included in the table above as it is reported as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
you should be aware that preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
although we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimate or in the assumptions that we use in calculating the estimate  unforeseen changes in the industry  or business could materially impact the estimate and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for some of our sales of remanufactured products  we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities 
such deposit is not recognized as revenue but rather carried as a core liability 
the liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to us 
we estimate and record provisions for cash discounts  quantity rebates  sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded  based upon our prior experience and current trends 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period 

index inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
future projected demand requires management judgment and is based upon a our review of historical trends and b our estimate of projected customer specific buying patterns and trends in the industry and markets in which we do business 
using rolling twelve month historical information  we estimate future demand on a continuous basis 
as such  the historical volatility of such estimates has been minimal 
we utilize cores used parts in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors 
the production of air conditioning compressors involves the rebuilding of used cores  which we acquire either in outright purchases from used parts brokers or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with customers 
under such exchange programs  we reduce our inventory  through a charge to cost of sales  when we sell a finished good compressor  and put back to inventory the used core exchanged at standard cost through a credit to cost of sales when it is actually received from the customer 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
new customer acquisition costs 
new customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor s brand 
in addition  change over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer s inventory and replacing it with standard motor products inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift 
new customer acquisition costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or recovery  respectively  within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

index we maintain valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies 
we consider all positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred tax asset 
we also consider cumulative losses in recent years as well as the impact of one time events in assessing our pre tax earnings 
assumptions regarding future taxable income require significant judgment 
our assumptions are consistent with estimates and plans used to manage our business 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods for current trends or expected changes in our estimating assumptions  we may need to modify the level of valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in december  we realized a non recurring non cash benefit of million in our tax provision related to a reduction of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance on net us deferred tax assets 
in assessing the ability to recognize our deferred tax assets  we reviewed all positive and negative evidence and considered historical book and taxable income  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and projected future book and taxable income 
based upon this detailed assessment  we determined that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our net us deferred tax assets  for which a valuation allowance had been previously recorded  will be realized and  as such  reversed million of the valuation allowance on net us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance of million as of december  is intended to provide for uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of our state tax credit carryovers  us capital loss carryforwards  us foreign tax credit carryovers  and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
based on these considerations  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset of million as of december   which is net of the remaining valuation allowance 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices  we recognize in our financial statements only those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
we establish tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold 
interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consists of customer relationships  trademarks and trade names  patents and non compete agreements 
the fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on our assessment 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized to earnings  but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
we assess the impairment of long lived and identifiable intangibles assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
with respect to goodwill  we test for impairment of goodwill of a reporting unit on an annual basis or in interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  b significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and c significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
when performing our evaluation  if we conclude qualitatively that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  than the two step impairment test is not required 
if we are unable to reach this conclusion  then we would perform the two step impairment test 
initially  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform a second step  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 

index intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in addition  identifiable intangible assets having indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
in reviewing for impairment  we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value 
there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows requiring our judgment in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of identifiable intangibles and long lived asset impairment including projecting revenues  interest rates  tax rates and the cost of capital 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
in the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets  we would be required to include an expense in our statement of operations  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
retirement and postretirement medical benefits 
each year  we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  nonretirement postemployment benefits  and fasb asc  retirement benefits 
the determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated costs requires the use of actuarial computations to estimate participant plan benefits the employees will be entitled to 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are the eligibility criteria of participants and the discount rate used to value the future obligation 
the discount rate reflects the yields available on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
share based compensation 
the provisions of fasb asc  stock compensation  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical trends in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
we monitor actual forfeitures for any subsequent adjustment to forfeiture rates to reflect actual forfeitures 
environmental reserves 
we are subject to various us federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and are involved in certain environmental remediation efforts 
we estimate and accrue our liabilities resulting from such matters based upon a variety of factors including the assessments of environmental engineers and consultants who provide estimates of potential liabilities and remediation costs 
such estimates are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing of the expenditures  which may extend over several years 
potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties of environmental remediation liabilities are recognized independently from the recorded liability  and any asset related to the recovery will be recognized only when the realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable 

index asbestos litigation 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our most recent actuarial study as of august  estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs and any potential recovery from insurance carriers  ranging from million to million for the period through as a result  in september an incremental million provision in our discontinued operation was added to the asbestos accrual increasing the reserve to approximately million as of that date 
based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all other available information considered by us  we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  according to the updated study  legal costs  which are expensed as incurred and reported in earnings loss from discontinued operation  are estimated to range from million to million during the same period 
we will continue to perform an annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will continue to reassess the recorded liability and  if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operation 
the aforementioned estimated settlement payments and legal costs do not reflect any limited coverage that we may obtain pursuant to agreements with insurance carriers for certain asbestos related claims 
other loss reserves 
we have other loss exposures  for such matters as product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu  which amended the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income 
the amendment eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity

additionally  reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income will be presented on the face of the financial statements 
the amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   which for us was january  with full retrospective application required 
as a result of the adoption of this standard  we have eliminated the presentation of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity and have instead presented other comprehensive income in a new statement  consolidated statements of comprehensive income  which immediately follows our consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu  which indefinitely defers the requirement in fasb asu to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
during the deferral period  entities will still need to comply with the existing requirements for the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   which for us was january  with full retrospective application required 
the adoption of this standard did not impact the manner in which we present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu  which amends the provisions of fasb asc  comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update supercede and replace the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in fasb asu and asu the amendment requires an entity to present information about significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
the amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   which for us is january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of fasb asu will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 

index goodwill impairment testing in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment asu  that amended the provisions of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
fasb asu permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform the two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december   which for us was january  we considered this new standard when conducting our annual impairment test of goodwill 
indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing in july  the fasb issued asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which amended the provisions of fasb asc fasb asu permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform the two step impairment test for that indefinite lived intangible asset 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after september   which for us is january  early adoption is permitted 
we will consider this new standard when conducting our annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets 
balance sheet disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the amendment will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of fasb asu will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  the euro  the polish zloty  the mexican peso and the hong kong dollar 
as of december   our monetary assets and liabilities which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore  the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rates affecting the foreign currencies in which monetary assets and liabilities are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we have in the past entered into interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was and at december  and  respectively 
depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our excess cash  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have an approximate million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
