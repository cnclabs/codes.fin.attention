during  we recognized aggregate pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for numerous catastrophe and weather events  including the february christchurch  new zealand earthquake new zealand ii  the japanese earthquake and tsunami  the series of severe us storms and tornadoes in april may  first quarter australian weather events january floods and cyclone yasi  the thai floods  the june christchurch aftershock new zealand iii  the danish floods  hurricane irene and tropical storm lee  these events impacted our reinsurance segment to a greater extent 
comparatively  in  we recognized pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for storm sandy and an aggregate million for the impact 
table of contents of severe drought conditions on us crops  hurricane isaac and first and second quarter us weather events 
growth in net premiums earned in our insurance segment and improvements in the current accident year loss ratios exclusive of the catastrophe and weather related losses for both segments further contributed to the improvement in  this was partially offset by a million reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development and growth in general and administrative expenses 
our insurance segment underwriting income for included aggregate pre tax net losses inclusive of premiums to reinstate reinsurance protection of million related to the events noted above 
comparatively  underwriting income for included pre tax net losses inclusive of related premiums to reinstate reinsurance protection of million for storm sandy and an aggregate million for hurricane isaac and first and second quarter us weather events 
despite increased catastrophe and weather related losses in  underwriting income for the segment improved due to growth in net premiums earned driven by the expansion of our business over the past year  an improvement in the current accident year loss ratio exclusive of catastrophe and weather activity and a million increase in net favorable prior year reserve development 
this was partially offset by commensurate growth in acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
the million improvement in the reinsurance segment underwriting result was primarily attributable to the significantly lower level of natural catastrophe and weather related losses  the majority of our natural catastrophe and weather related losses emanated from our reinsurance segment and drove the underwriting loss for that year 
the segment underwriting loss for included aggregate pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for the events noted above  with the most significant amounts being for new zealand ii  the japanese earthquake and tsunami and the first quarter australian weather events 
comparatively  in  we recognized pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for storm sandy and an aggregate million for the impact of severe drought conditions on us crops  hurricane isaac and first and second quarter us weather events 
an improvement in the current accident year loss ratio  exclusive of these catastrophe and weather related losses  further contributed to the improvement in partially offsetting these improvements was a million reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development  a reduction in net premiums earned and increases in acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
versus the significantly high frequency and severity of natural catastrophe activity in  described above  was the primary driver of the deterioration in underwriting results in that year 
however  natural catastrophe activity also impacted underwriting results for in comparison to the million for noted above  during we recognized aggregate pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for the september new zealand earthquake new zealand i and the chilean earthquake  with substantially all of this emanating from our reinsurance segment 
further contributing to the reduction in underwriting income was a million decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development 
our insurance segment s underwriting income included million in pre tax net losses inclusive of related premiums to reinstate reinsurance protection related to the events of noted above  while catastrophe losses in were insignificant 
a million reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development and an increase in acquisition costs also contributed to the reduction in underwriting income  reductions in ceded reinsurance costs and increases in gross premiums written contributed to higher net premiums earned and partially offset these reductions 
our reinsurance segment underwriting loss included aggregate pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for the events of noted above 
substantially all of our natural catastrophe related pre tax net losses in emanated from the reinsurance segment 
a million reduction in net favorable prior period reserve development also contributed to the variance in the underwriting result between periods 
net investment income the variability in our net investment income for through was largely attributable to our alternative investment portfolio other investments 
income from this portfolio increased by million in  driven by improved performance for our hedge funds reflective of global equity market performance and credit funds driven by pricing improvement in underlying bank loans 
comparatively  income from these investments decreased million in  reflective of the underperformance of both global equities and bank loans during in that year 
excluding income from our other investments  net investment income decreased by million and million  respectively  in and these decreases were primarily attributable our fixed maturity portfolio  where lower reinvestment yields drove reductions in income despite higher investment balances 

table of contents net realized investment gains during each period presented  we realized net investment gains largely due to the sale of fixed maturities 
other than temporary impairment otti charges were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other expenses revenues  net appreciation in the sterling and euro against the us dollar drove foreign exchange losses of million in  related to the remeasurement of our foreign denominated net insurance related liabilities 
in and  depreciation in these currencies resulted in foreign exchange gains of million and million  respectively 
excluding these foreign exchange related amounts  other expenses were million  million and million  respectively in  and the million decrease in was driven by a million reduction in income tax expense  as taxable income declined due to the significant catastrophe activity previously noted 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest expense following our march senior note issuance 
a million increase in corporate expenses drove the increase in other expenses in separation payments and accelerated and incremental share based compensation costs related to our second quarter senior leadership transition totaled million and were the primary driver of this increase 
partially offsetting the increase in corporate expenses was a million reduction in tax expense  as the impact of storm sandy led to minimal taxable income in the us for loss on repurchase of preferred shares in conjunction with the effective reduction of the dividend rate on our preferred equity base previously discussed  we repurchased million of our series a preferred shares and million of our series b preferred shares during the first half of while the series a shares were redeemed at liquidation value  we paid a million premium to repurchase the series b shares in advance of the first eligible redemption date 
this premium  combined with the recognition of the proportionate share of issue costs for both series as an expense  resulted in a million loss 
as the issue costs for these shares were recognized in shareholders equity in the period the shares were originally issued  the only impact on book value related to the million premium on the series b repurchase
