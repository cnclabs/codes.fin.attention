as of december   allstate agencies have approximately billion of non proprietary mutual funds and fixed and variable annuity account balances under management 
competition we compete on a wide variety of factors  including the type and level of service provided by distribution systems  product offerings  the positioning of brands  financial strength and ratings  prices and the level of customer service 
with regard to funding agreements  which we most recently offered in  we compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings 
the market for life insurance  retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive 
as of december   there were approximately groups of life insurance companies in the united states  most of which offered one or more similar products 
according to am best  as of december   the allstate financial segment is the nation th largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of ordinary life insurance in force and rd largest on the basis of statutory admitted assets 
in addition  because many of these products include a savings or investment component  our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms  investment advisors  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors  including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses  as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry 
geographic markets we sell life insurance  voluntary accident and health insurance  and retirement and investment products throughout the united states 
through subsidiaries  we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  the us virgin islands and guam

in addition  arrangements made with other companies  agencies  and brokers allow allstate exclusive agencies the ability to make available non proprietary products to consumers when an allstate product is not available 
in the us  we sell these allstate brand products through approximately  allstate exclusive agencies in approximately  locations 
in addition  these agencies employ approximately  licensed sales professionals 
table of contents who are licensed to sell our products 
we have strategies to assist agency owners of all sizes and tenure be successful 
we are planning to grow the number of exclusive agencies following several years of decline primarily resulting from agency consolidations and mergers  consistent with our prior plans 
we pursue opportunities for growing allstate brand exclusive agency distribution based on demographic shifts and market conditions 
we support exclusive agencies in a variety of ways to facilitate customer service and allstate overall growth strategy 
for example  we offer assistance to allstate exclusive agencies with sales and business processes and we provide education and other resources to help them acquire more business and retain more customers 
our programs to support our exclusive agencies and help them grow larger include offering financing to agents to acquire other agencies and awarding additional resources to better performing agencies 
we support our relationship with allstate exclusive agencies through several national and regional working groups the agency executive council  led by allstate senior leadership  engages exclusive agencies on our customer service and growth strategy 
membership includes allstate exclusive agency owners selected on the basis of performance  thought leadership and credibility among their peer group 
the national advisory board brings together allstate senior leadership and a cross section of allstate exclusive agents and exclusive financial specialists from around the country to address national business issues and develop solutions 
regional advisory boards support allstate exclusive agency owner engagement within each of allstate regional offices in the us and within canada 
allstate strategy is to help improve individual agency success  new business sales  customer satisfaction  retention and productivity 
allstate is striving to help develop stronger  more valuable exclusive agencies with resources to build stronger customer relationships  provide differentiating levels of service by focusing on more complex customer needs  and support technology that enables customer self service for simpler needs 
over a two year period that began in  allstate is transitioning to a new compensation structure for allstate exclusive agencies 
the structure rewards agencies for delivering high value to our customers and achieving certain business outcomes such as product profitability  net growth and a diverse product mix 
this cost neutral change will include a shift to a higher proportion of variable compensation and bonus 
in  base commission rates remained unchanged  and the annual bonus was based on portfolio growth and household cross sales 
in  a portion of base commission will become variable compensation  focused on agency success factors and customer experience 
other elements of exclusive agency compensation and support include start up agency bonuses  marketing support payments  technology and data allowances  regional promotions and recognition trips based on achievement 
since allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance  beginning in all allstate brand customers who purchased their policies directly through call centers and the internet will be assigned an allstate exclusive agency relationship 
we believe this will more effectively address customer needs while not significantly increasing costs

reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis

the esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in resulting in a reduction in reserves due to lower severity 
the adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio 
the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for gaap reporting  and a liability for the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for billion 
remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between gaap and statutory reporting 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of decreased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions 

table of contents loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation  primarily at the state level 
the method  extent  and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters  including insurer solvency  reserve adequacy  insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  policy forms  rate setting  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  underwriting standards  statutory accounting methods  trade practices  and corporate governance 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
as part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank was enacted in hundreds of regulations required pursuant to this law must still be finalized  and we cannot predict what the final regulations will require but do not expect a material impact on allstate operations 
the law also created the federal insurance office fio within the treasury department 
the fio monitors the insurance industry  provides advice to the financial stability oversight council fsoc  represents the us on international insurance matters and studies the current regulatory system  and is expected to submit a report to congress in in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
we cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
we are working for changes in the regulatory environment  including recognizing the need for better catastrophe preparedness  improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions for mega catastrophes that will make insurance more available and affordable 
we have also taken actions to reduce the catastrophe exposure in our property business and to consider the impact of these actions on our ability to market our auto lines 
agent and broker compensation 
in recent years  several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies 
the proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers 
agents and brokers in new york are required to disclose certain information concerning compensation 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other 
table of contents jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
insurance holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of california  florida  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new york  texas  and wisconsin  and some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in california  florida  and utah 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person that controls an insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in california  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new york  texas  utah  and wisconsin 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay  or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation common stock 
rate regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state regulatory authority 
in many cases  such rating plans  policy forms  or both must be approved prior to use 
the speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the rating laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator approval to use a rate  but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
eighteen states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of rating laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing 
an insurer ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators  and special interest groups to reduce  freeze  or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure  particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss costs from high levels of catastrophe losses 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and rating has been the subject of challenges and investigations by regulators  legislators  and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rating 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities  and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 

table of contents michigan catastrophic claim association 
the michigan catastrophic claim association mcca is a mandatory insurance coverage and reinsurance reimbursement mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other mcca fiscal year 
the retention level is thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending june  and it operates similar to a reinsurance program and is funded through a portion of insurance premiums but may not be funded on an actuarial basis and can accumulate unfunded claims liabilities 
as required for a member company  we report covered paid and unpaid claims to the mcca  when estimates of loss for a reported claim exceed the retention 
the mcca reimburses members as claims are paid and billed by members to the mcca 
because of the nature of the coverage  losses may be paid over the lifetime of an insured  accordingly  significant levels of incurred but not reported claims reserves ibnr are recorded by member companies as well as offsetting reinsurance recoverables 
by statute  the mcca is funded by assessments from member companies who  in turn  can recover assessments from policyholders 
the mcca has unfunded claims liabilities with a reimbursement payable to its members 
we do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on allstate 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
national flood insurance program 
we voluntarily participate as a write your own carrier in the national flood insurance program nfip 
the nfip is administered and regulated by the federal emergency management agency 
we operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the standard flood insurance policy 
this involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the united states treasury 
we receive expense allowances from the nfip for underwriting administration  claims management  commissions and adjuster fees 
the federal government is obligated to pay all claims that fall under the arrangement 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer ability to exit a market 
for example  states may limit  to varying degrees  an insurer ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities 
the sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial industry regulatory authority finra 
broker dealers  investment advisors  and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors  and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the sec  finra and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information 
congress  state legislatures  and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
asbestos 
congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past  but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution and clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a 
table of contents mechanism to assign liability to prps or to fund the clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  has disputed and is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation  and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
while comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  only modest reform measures have been enacted

we believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates  assumptions and plans 
however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other products and financial services 
these risks constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and historical trends 
these cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this document  in our filings with the sec or in materials incorporated therein by reference 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made events  including earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  wildfires  tornadoes  tsunamis  hurricanes  tropical storms and certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents 
we may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of those experienced in prior years  the average expected level used in pricing  our current reinsurance coverage limits  or estimate of loss from external hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability 
despite our catastrophe management programs  we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial condition 
for example  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane katrina in totaling billion  the northridge earthquake of totaling billion and hurricane andrew in totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the california earthquake authority and various state created insurance facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our operating results and financial condition along with others in the insurance industry  we use models developed by third party vendors as well as our own historic data in assessing our property insurance exposure to catastrophe losses 
these models assume various conditions and probability scenarios 
such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models  which have been evolving since the early s  use historical information and scientific research about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period as actual catastrophic events vary considerably 
other limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models  material increases and decreases in results due to model changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and actual conditions that are not yet well understood or may not be properly incorporated into the models 
impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth due to our catastrophe risk management efforts  the size of our homeowners business has been negatively impacted and may continue to be negatively impacted if we take further actions 
homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be more adversely impacted than we expect by adjustments to our business structure  size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure 
in addition  due to the diminished potential 
table of contents for cross selling opportunities that cannot be fully replaced by our brokering arrangement to allow our agents to write property products with other carriers  new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected 
a regulatory environment that limits rate increases and requires us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
for example  if allstate protection loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may impose rate rollbacks  require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders  or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases 
such resistance affects our ability  in all product lines  to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity  or as the facilities recognize a financial deficit  they may in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers  adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of our sophisticated risk segmentation process may not be fully realized we believe that sophisticated pricing and underwriting which  in some situations  considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and sophisticated pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  our competitive advantage could decline or be lost 
further  the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our sophisticated pricing models 
furthermore  we cannot be assured that these sophisticated pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur 
allstate protection operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition 
unexpected increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition unexpected changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our allstate protection segment 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings  and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
although we pursue various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 

table of contents our allstate protection segment may experience volatility in claim frequency from time to time  and short term trends may not continue over the longer term 
a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include  but are not limited to  law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines is inherently uncertain and may have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigation are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability and financial condition our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business 
we establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that we must hold to support in force contracts taking into account rating agencies and regulatory requirements 
we monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target new business returns on a portfolio basis  which could result in the discontinuation or de emphasis of products or distribution relationships and a decline in sales 
profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions 
additionally  many of our products have fixed or guaranteed terms that limit our ability to increase revenues or reduce benefits  including credited interest  once the product has been issued 
our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment spreads  the management of market and credit risks associated with investments  the sufficiency of premiums and contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits  the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses  and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances 
legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability and financial condition 
changes in reserve estimates may adversely affect our operating results the reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  persistency and expenses 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions  adjustments to reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac may be required which could have a material effect on our operating results 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial spread based products  such as fixed annuities and institutional products  is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates 

table of contents when market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels  proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment spread 
lowering interest crediting rates on some products in such an environment can partially offset decreases in investment yield 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in investment yields 
decreases in the interest crediting rates offered on products in the allstate financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals 
non parallel shifts in interest rates  such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates  can influence customer demand for fixed annuities  which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers  which can lead to increased surrenders at a time when the segment fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
this could lead to the sale of fixed income securities at a loss 
for certain products  principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products  the earned rate on assets could lag behind rising market yields 
we may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates  which could narrow spreads and reduce profitability 
unanticipated surrenders could result in accelerated amortization of dac or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
in addition  changes in market interest rates impact the valuation of derivatives embedded in equity indexed annuity contracts that are not hedged  which could lead to volatility in net income 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment products may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition through the amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future gross profits egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the principal assumptions for determining the amount of egp are mortality  persistency  expenses  investment returns  including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities  interest crediting rates to contractholders  and the effects of any hedges 
updates to these assumptions commonly referred to as dac unlocking could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
reducing our concentration in spread based business may adversely affect reported results we have been reducing our concentration in spread based business 
lower new sales of these products could negatively impact investment portfolio levels  complicate settlement of expiring contracts including forced sales of assets with unrealized capital losses  and affect goodwill impairment testing and insurance reserves deficiency testing 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products and adversely affect our financial condition under current federal and state income tax law  certain products we offer  primarily life insurance and annuities  receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress and various state legislatures from time to time consider legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress and various state legislatures also consider proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance or annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material effect on our profitability and financial condition or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
we may not be able to mitigate the capital impact associated with statutory reserving requirements  potentially resulting in a need to increase prices  reduce sales of term or universal life products  and or a return on equity below priced levels to support statutory reserves for certain term and universal life insurance products with secondary guarantees  we currently utilize reinsurance and capital markets solutions for financing a portion of our statutory reserve requirements deemed to be non economic 
as we continue to underwrite term and universal life business  we expect to have additional financing needs to mitigate the impact of these reserve requirements 
if we do not obtain additional financing as a result of market conditions or otherwise  this could require us to increase prices  reduce our sales of term or universal life products  and or result in a return on equity below priced levels 

table of contents risks relating to investments we are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality which may adversely affect investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses although we continually reevaluate our investment management strategies  we remain subject to the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices or currency exchange rates 
adverse changes to these rates  spreads and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal policy and the economic climate  the liquidity of a market or market segment  insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants  or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and or risk tolerance 
we are subject to risks associated with potential declines in credit quality related to specific issuers or specific industries and a general weakening in the economy  which are typically reflected through credit spreads 
credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk free rate typically referenced as the yield on us treasury securities that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit  liquidity and or prepayment risks 
credit spreads vary ie increase or decrease in response to the market perception of risk and liquidity in a specific issuer or specific sector and are influenced by the credit ratings  and the reliability of those ratings  published by external rating agencies 
although we have the ability to use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks  the effectiveness of such instruments is subject to the same risks 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized and unrealized losses on securities  including realized and unrealized losses relating to equity and derivative strategies 
a decline in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may earn less than the portfolio average yield 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
a decline could also lead us to purchase longer term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
alternatively  longer term assets may be sold and reinvested in shorter term assets in anticipation of rising interest rates 
an increase in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
declining equity markets could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease and decreasing interest rates could cause the funding target and the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other postretirement benefit plans to increase  either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans and a reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  increases in pension and other postretirement benefit expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans 
deteriorating financial performance impacting securities collateralized by residential and commercial mortgage loans  collateralized corporate loans  and commercial mortgage loans may lead to write downs and impact our results of operations and financial condition changes in residential or commercial mortgage delinquencies  loss severities or recovery rates  declining residential or commercial real estate prices  corporate loan delinquencies or recovery rates  changes in credit or bond insurer strength ratings and the quality of service provided by service providers on securities in our portfolios could lead us to determine that write downs are necessary in the future 
the impact of our investment strategies may be adversely affected by developments in the financial markets the impact of our investment management strategies may be adversely affected by unexpected developments in the financial markets 
for example  derivative contracts may result in coverage that is not as effective as intended thereby leading to the recognition of losses without the recognition of gains expected to mitigate the losses 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  collateral type  group of related industries  geographic sector or risk type could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition 
events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 

table of contents the determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments of our investments is subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition the determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our ongoing evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other than temporary impairments in our results of operations 
the assessment of whether other than temporary impairments have occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
our conclusions on such assessments are judgmental and include assumptions and projections of future cash flows which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions  facts and circumstances change 
furthermore  historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments and additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future 
the determination of the fair value of our fixed income and equity securities is subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition in determining fair values we principally use the market approach which utilizes market transaction data for the same or similar instruments 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information 
the fair value of assets may differ from the actual amount received upon sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
moreover  the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the assets fair values 
the difference between amortized cost or cost and fair value  net of deferred income taxes  certain life and annuity dac  certain deferred sales inducement costs  and certain reserves for life contingent contract benefits  is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
changing market conditions could materially affect the determination of the fair value of securities and unrealized net capital gains and losses could vary significantly 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future growth and profitability are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include other insurers and  because some of our products include a savings or investment component  securities firms  investment advisers  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
we have invested in growth strategies through the recent addition of the esurance brand  our differentiated encompass package policy and our distinctive advertising campaigns 
if we are unsuccessful in generating new business and retaining a sufficient number of our customers  our ability to increase premiums written could be impacted 
in addition  if we experience unexpected increases in our underlying costs such as the frequency or severity of claims costs generated by our new business  it could result in decreases in our profitability and lead to price increases which could impair our ability to compete effectively for insurance business 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
this includes competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents and their licensed sales professionals 
in the event we are unable to attract and retain these producers or they are unable to attract and retain customers for our products  growth and retention could be materially affected 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
our ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions  in developing the talent and skills of our human resources  in assimilating new executive talent into our organization  or in deploying human resource talent consistently with our business goals 
difficult conditions in the global economy and capital markets generally could adversely affect our business and operating results and these conditions may not improve in the near future as with most businesses  we believe difficult conditions in the global economy and capital markets  such as significant negative macroeconomic trends  including relatively high and sustained unemployment  reduced consumer spending  lower residential and commercial real estate prices  substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt  including defaults on home mortgages  and the relatively low availability of credit could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

table of contents stressed conditions  volatility and disruptions in global capital markets  particular markets or financial asset classes could adversely affect our investment portfolio 
disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes 
although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated  not all global financial markets are functioning normally  and the rate of recovery from the us recession has been below historic averages 
several governments around the world have announced austerity actions to address their budget deficits that may lead to a decline in economic activity 
while european policy makers have developed mechanisms to address funding concerns  risks to the european economy and financial markets remain 
general economic conditions could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure investment results 
consumer behavior changes could include decreased demand for our products 
for example  as consumers purchase fewer automobiles  our sales of auto insurance may decline 
also  as consumers become more cost conscious  they may choose lower levels of auto and homeowners insurance 
in addition  holders of some of our interest sensitive life insurance and annuity products may engage in an elevated level of discretionary withdrawals of contractholder funds 
our investment results could be adversely affected as deteriorating financial and business conditions affect the issuers of the securities in our investment portfolio 
there can be no assurance that actions of the us federal government  federal reserve and other regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets and stimulating the economy will achieve the intended effect in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system  the financial markets and the broader economy in recent years  the us federal government  the federal reserve and other regulatory bodies have taken actions such as purchasing mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions  investing directly in banks  thrifts and bank and savings and loan holding companies and increasing federal spending to stimulate the economy 
there can be no assurance as to the long term impact such actions will have on the financial markets or on economic conditions  including potential inflationary effects 
continued volatility and any further economic deterioration could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
losses from legal and regulatory actions may be material to our operating results  cash flows and financial condition as is typical for a large company  we are involved in various legal actions  including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products  some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts 
we are also involved in various regulatory actions and inquiries  including market conduct exams by state insurance regulatory agencies 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters  the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition 
the aggregate estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued  if any  disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements is not an indication of expected loss  if any 
actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as insurance companies  broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies  many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
changes may sometimes lead to additional expenses  increased legal exposure  and additional limits on our ability to grow or to achieve targeted profitability 
moreover  laws and regulations are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  state attorneys general and federal agencies including the sec  the finra and the us department of justice 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator or enforcement authority interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products  
table of contents not holders of securities  which is generally the jurisdiction of the sec  issued by the allstate corporation 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business 
regulatory reforms  and the more stringent application of existing regulations  may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business the federal government has enacted comprehensive regulatory reforms for financial services entities 
as part of a larger effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market  certain reforms are applicable to the insurance industry  including the fio established within the treasury department 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny  members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance companies  and the fio and fsoc were established 
in the future  if the fsoc were to determine that allstate is a systemically important nonbank financial company  allstate would be subject to regulation by the federal reserve board 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance and financial regulation 
these regulatory reforms and any additional legislative change or regulatory requirements imposed upon us in connection with the federal government regulatory reform of the financial services industry or arising from reform related to the international regulatory capital framework for financial services firms  and any more stringent enforcement of existing regulations by federal authorities  may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business  or limit our ability to grow or to achieve profitability 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide 
market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as is currently available 
for example  our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost  and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in future years 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our catastrophe exposure  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including changes in market conditions  whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
we also have credit risk exposure associated with the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca  a mandatory insurance coverage and reinsurance reimbursement mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other mcca fiscal year  which is operating with an increasing deficit 
our reinsurance recoverable from the mcca was billion as of december  our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition 
a large scale pandemic  the continued threat of terrorism or military actions may have an adverse effect on the level of claim losses we incur  the value of our investment portfolio  our competitive position  marketability of product offerings  liquidity and operating results a large scale pandemic  the continued threat of terrorism  within the united states and abroad  or military and other actions  and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses in our investment portfolio from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by a large scale pandemic or the continued threat of terrorism 
additionally  a large scale pandemic or terrorist act could have a material effect on the sales  profitability  competitiveness  marketability of product offerings  liquidity  and operating results 

table of contents a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  access to and cost of borrowing  operating results and financial condition financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review our financial performance and condition and could downgrade or change the outlook on our ratings due to  for example  a change in one of our insurance company statutory capital  a change in a rating agency determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of our investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or our business strategy  as well as a number of other considerations that may or may not be under our control 
the insurance financial strength ratings of allstate insurance company and allstate life insurance company and the allstate corporation senior debt ratings from am best  standard poor and moody are subject to continuous review  and the retention of current ratings cannot be assured 
a downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material effect on our sales  our competitiveness  the marketability of our product offerings  our liquidity  access to and cost of borrowing  operating results and financial condition 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms in periods of extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets  liquidity and credit capacity may be severely restricted 
in such circumstances  our ability to obtain capital to fund operating expenses  financing costs  capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited  and the cost of any such capital may be significant 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as lenders perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently if conditions warrant  by comparing the carrying value attributed equity of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
market declines or other events impacting the fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment  resulting in a charge to income 
such a charge could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles  which are periodically revised  interpreted and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations  or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions  which may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected 
for a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and  if known  our estimates of their expected impact  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the change in our unrecognized tax benefit during the next months is subject to uncertainty we have disclosed our estimate of net unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonably possible increase or decrease in its balance during the next months in note of the consolidated financial statements 
however  actual results may differ from our estimate for reasons such as changes in our position on specific issues  developments with respect to the governments interpretations of income tax laws or changes in judgment resulting from new information obtained in audits or the appeals process 
the realization of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty the realization of our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  is based on our assumption that we will be able to fully utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes 
however  actual results may differ from our assumptions if adequate levels of taxable income are not attained 

table of contents the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect holding company liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service our debt  or complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected 
the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning or a support failure from external providers during a disaster could impair our ability to conduct business effectively the occurrence of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  an industrial accident  a terrorist attack or war  cyber attack  events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems  or a support failure from external providers  could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing  transmission  storage  and retrieval systems or destroy data 
if a significant number of our managers were unavailable in the event of a disaster  our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised 
we depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions 
despite our implementation of a variety of security measures  our computer systems could be subject to cyber attacks and unauthorized access  such as physical and electronic break ins or unauthorized tampering 
like other global companies  we have experienced threats to our data and systems  including malware and computer virus attacks  unauthorized access  system failures and disruptions 
if one or more of these events occurs  it could potentially jeopardize the confidential  proprietary and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations  which could result in damage to our reputation  financial losses  litigation  increased costs  regulatory penalties and or customer dissatisfaction or loss 
changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  profitability or cash flows climate change  to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns  could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires  the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance  and the results for our allstate protection segment 
loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect personal information of our customers  claimants or employees could affect our operations we rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the united states and abroad 
these include  for example  vendors of computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services and human resource benefits management services 
in the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services  or fails to protect personal information of our customers  claimants or employees  we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property 
although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property 
we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property and to determine its scope  validity or enforceability  which could divert significant resources and prove unsuccessful 
an inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material effect on our business 
we may be subject to claims by third parties for patent  trademark or copyright infringement or breach of usage rights 
any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability 
if our third party providers or we are found to have infringed a third party intellectual property right  either of us could be enjoined from providing certain products or services or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods  processes  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets or licenses 
alternatively  we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly work around 
any of these scenarios could have a material effect on our business and results of operations

table of contents application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining fair value of financial assets impairment of fixed income and equity securities deferred policy acquisition costs amortization reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation in making these determinations  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to our businesses and operations 
it is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates  see the referenced sections of this document 
for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial assets fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies 
we use independent third party valuation service providers  broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values 
we obtain or calculate only one single quote or price for each financial instrument 
valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and  through the use of proprietary models  produce valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual fixed income and other securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements 
the inputs used by the valuation service providers include  but are not limited to  market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities  interest rate yield curves  credit spreads  liquidity spreads  currency rates  and other information  as applicable 
credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities 
valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value the same financial instruments 
the valuation models take into account  among other things  market observable information as of the measurement date  as described above  as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term  interest rate  credit rating  industry sector  and where applicable  collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information 
executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience 
for certain equity securities  valuation service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date 
in cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited  the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information 
for certain of our financial assets measured at fair value  where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations  we obtain a single non binding price quote from a broker familiar with the security who  similar to our valuation service providers  may consider transactions or activity in similar securities among other information 
the brokers providing price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with market making  underwriting and distribution expertise regarding the security subject to valuation 
the fair value of certain financial assets  including privately placed corporate fixed income securities  auction rate securities ars backed by student loans  equity indexed notes  and certain free standing derivatives  for which our valuation service providers or brokers do not provide fair value determinations  is determined using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry 
our internal pricing methods are primarily based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that develop a single best estimate of fair value 
our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments  including yield curves  quoted market prices of comparable securities  published credit spreads  and other applicable market data as well as instrument specific characteristics that include  but are not limited to  coupon rates  expected cash flows  sector of the issuer  and call provisions 
judgment is required 
table of contents in developing these fair values 
as a result  the fair value of these financial assets may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
moreover  the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets fair values 
for most of our financial assets measured at fair value  all significant inputs are based on or corroborated by market observable data and significant management judgment does not affect the periodic determination of fair value 
the determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on or corroborated by market observable data 
however  where market observable data is available  it takes precedence  and as a result  no range of reasonably likely inputs exists from which the basis of a sensitivity analysis could be constructed 
there is one primary situation where a discounted cash flow model utilizes a significant input that is not market observable  and it relates to the determination of fair value for our ars backed by student loans 
the significant input utilized is the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market that is  when auction failures will cease 
determination of this assumption allows for matching to market observable inputs when performing these valuations 
the fair value of our ars backed by student loans is million as of december  we performed a sensitivity analysis of reasonably likely changes in the anticipated date liquidity will return to the student loan ars market as of december  if the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market increased or decreased by six months  the fair value of our ars backed by student loans would decrease or increase by  respectively 
the selection of these hypothetical scenarios represents an illustration of the estimated potential proportional effect of alternate assumptions and should not be construed as either a prediction of future events or an indication that it would be reasonably likely that all securities would be similarly affected 
we gain assurance that our financial assets are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies  including inputs and assumptions  and compliance with accounting standards 
for fair values received from third parties or internally estimated  our processes and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied  the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value  and the fair values are accurately recorded 
for example  on a continuing basis  we assess the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models 
we perform procedures to understand and assess the methodologies  processes and controls of valuation service providers 
in addition  we may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers or brokers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities 
we perform ongoing price validation procedures such as back testing of actual sales  which corroborate the various inputs used in internal models to market observable data 
when fair value determinations are expected to be more variable  we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions 
we also perform an analysis to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity  and if so  whether transactions may not be orderly 
among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market  trading volume in the secondary market  level of credit spreads over historical levels  bid ask spread  and price consensuses among market participants and sources 
if evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly  we place little  if any  weight on the transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal model 
as of december  and  we did not alter fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal model for such securities 

table of contents the following table identifies fixed income and equity securities and short term investments as of december  by source of fair value determination in millions fair value percent to total fair value based on internal sources fair value based on external sources total includes billion that are valued using broker quotes 
for additional detail on fair value measurements  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of fixed income and equity securities for investments classified as available for sale  the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities  net of certain other items and deferred income taxes as disclosed in note  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when a write down is recorded due to an other than temporary decline in fair value 
we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
for each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position  we assess whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity  contractual or regulatory purposes 
if a security meets either of these criteria  the security decline in fair value is considered other than temporary and is recorded in earnings 
if we have not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  we evaluate whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to be collected from the fixed income security  discounted at the security original or current effective rate  as appropriate  to calculate a recovery value and determine whether a credit loss exists 
the determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security 
all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable assumptions and forecasts  are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
that information generally includes  but is not limited to  the remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  foreign exchange rates  the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer  expected defaults  expected recoveries  the value of underlying collateral  vintage  geographic concentration  available reserves or escrows  current subordination levels  third party guarantees and other credit enhancements 
other information  such as industry analyst reports and forecasts  sector credit ratings  financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities  and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows  may also be considered 
the estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if we determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement 
if the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized cost of the security  a credit loss exists and an other than temporary impairment for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings 
the portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we determine that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security  we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments of equity securities and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issue or issuer  including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends  geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in an unrealized loss position  including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity 

table of contents once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to subsequently determine that a fixed income or equity security is other than temporarily impaired  including general economic conditions that are worse than previously forecasted or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer or industry sector than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or issuer ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances that result in changes to management intent to sell or result in our assessment that it is more likely than not we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis of a fixed income security or causes a change in our ability or intent to hold an equity security until it recovers in value 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity  since our securities are designated as available for sale and carried at fair value and as a result  any related unrealized loss  net of deferred income taxes and related dac  deferred sales inducement costs and reserves for life contingent contract benefits  would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the determination of the amount of other than temporary impairment is an inherently subjective process based on periodic evaluations of the factors described above 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other than temporary impairments in results of operations as such evaluations are revised 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions in the determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
for additional detail on investment impairments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring insurance policies and investment contracts 
in accordance with gaap  costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies and investment contracts are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized into income as premiums are earned  typically over periods of six or twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac related to allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment returns  as well as mortality  persistency and expenses to administer the business are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
the assumptions for determining the timing and amount of dac amortization are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
generally  the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies 
the recovery of dac is dependent upon the future profitability of the business 
we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
we aggregate all traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies in the analysis 
in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist  any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and a premium deficiency reserve may be required if the remaining dac balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency 
in  and  our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary  primarily due to projected profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies 
dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits  which includes both actual historical gross profits agp and estimated future gross profits egp expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the amortization is net of interest on the prior period dac balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts 
actual amortization periods generally range from years  however  incorporating estimates of the rate of customer surrenders  partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the dac being amortized during the surrender charge period  which is typically years for interest sensitive life and years for fixed annuities 
the cumulative dac amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income when there is a difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total egp 

table of contents agp and egp primarily consist of the following components contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits benefit margin  investment income and realized capital gains and losses less interest credited investment margin  and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses expense margin 
the principal assumptions for determining the amount of egp are persistency  mortality  expenses  investment returns  including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities  interest crediting rates to contractholders  and the effects of any hedges  and these assumptions are reasonably likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of dac amortization 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to reasonably predict their future movements or offsetting impacts over time 
each reporting period  dac amortization is recognized in proportion to agp for that period adjusted for interest on the prior period dac balance 
this amortization process includes an assessment of agp compared to egp  the actual amount of business remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting the product liability 
the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac depends upon which product liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the gain or loss 
if the agp is greater than egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged  the amount of dac amortization will generally increase  resulting in a current period decrease to earnings 
the opposite result generally occurs when the agp is less than the egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged 
however  when dac amortization or a component of gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially negative which would result in an increase of the dac balance as a result of negative agp  the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the potential negative amortization are considered to determine whether it is appropriate for recognition in the consolidated financial statements 
negative amortization is only recorded when the increased dac balance is determined to be recoverable based on facts and circumstances 
negative amortization was not recorded for certain fixed annuities during  and periods in which capital losses were realized on their related investment portfolio 
for products whose supporting investments are exposed to capital losses in excess of our expectations which may cause periodic agp to become temporarily negative  egp and agp utilized in dac amortization may be modified to exclude the excess capital losses 
annually  we review and update all assumptions underlying the projections of egp  including persistency  mortality  expenses  investment returns  comprising investment income and realized capital gains and losses  interest crediting rates and the effect of any hedges 
at each reporting period  we assess whether any revisions to assumptions used to determine dac amortization are required 
these reviews and updates may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration  which are commonly referred to as dac unlocking 
if the update of assumptions causes total egp to increase  the rate of dac amortization will generally decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
a decrease to earnings generally occurs when the assumption update causes the total egp to decrease 
the following table provides the effect on dac amortization of changes in assumptions relating to the gross profit components of investment margin  benefit margin and expense margin during the years ended december in millions investment margin benefit margin expense margin net acceleration deceleration in  dac amortization acceleration for changes in the investment margin component of egp primarily related to fixed annuities and was due to lower projected investment returns 
the acceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to increased projected mortality on variable life insurance  partially offset by increased projected persistency on interest sensitive life insurance 
the deceleration related to expense margin related to interest sensitive life insurance and fixed annuities and was due to a decrease in projected expenses 
in  dac amortization deceleration related to changes in the investment margin component of egp primarily related to equity indexed annuities and was due to an increase in projected investment margins 
the deceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to increased projected persistency on interest sensitive life insurance 
the acceleration related to expense margin primarily related to interest sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected expenses 
in  dac amortization deceleration related to changes in the investment margin component of egp primarily related to interest sensitive life insurance and was due to higher than previously projected investment income and lower interest credited  partially offset by higher projected realized capital losses 
the acceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to lower projected renewal premium which is also expected to reduce persistency on interest sensitive life insurance  partially offset by higher than previously projected revenues associated with variable life insurance due to

reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued 
property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
the significant lines of business are auto  homeowners  and other lines for allstate protection  and asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines for discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported 
auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle  while auto physical damage  homeowners property and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year 
discontinued lines and coverages involve long tail losses  such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims  which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle 
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update most of our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve reestimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as property liability insurance claims and claims expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates reserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
the actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim counts  paid losses  case reserves  and development factors calculated with this data 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into the next time period 
the development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
the implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss 
table of contents development  as the significant size of our experience database achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
how reserve estimates are established and updated reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level  and the results of these numerous micro level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate 
for example  over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to estimate losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
the actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process 
development factors are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled  paid losses  and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity trends  which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these micro level estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves 
moreover  this detailed micro level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be meaningful 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
reserves are reestimated quarterly and periodically throughout the year  by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors 
this process incorporates the historic and latest actual trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
new development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results claims reported or settled  losses paid  or changes to case reserves occur differently than the implied assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations 
if claims reported  paid losses  or case reserve changes are greater or less than the levels estimated by previous development factors  reserve reestimates increase or decrease 
when actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves the previous estimate is the amount of reserve reestimate and is recognized as an increase or decrease in property liability insurance claims and claims expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
total property liability reserve reestimates  after tax  as a percent of net income were favorable  and in  and  respectively 
the year average of reserve reestimates as a percentage of total reserves was a favorable for property liability  a favorable for allstate protection and an unfavorable for discontinued lines and coverages  each of these results being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses 
a more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 

table of contents the following table shows net claims and claims expense reserves by segment and line of business as of december in millions allstate protection auto homeowners other lines total allstate protection discontinued lines and coverages asbestos environmental other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages total property liability allstate protection reserve estimates factors affecting reserve estimates reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends described above 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two year  three year  or longer development periods to reestimate our reserves 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line  coverage  or state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimation techniques described above 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  and other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
historically  the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims 
to provide for this  a development reserve is estimated using the processes described above  and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves 
typically  the case and supplemental development reserves comprise about of total reserves 
another major component of reserves is ibnr 
typically  ibnr comprises about of total reserves 
generally  the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on severity assumptions for different business segments  lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators  and reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes described above 
changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the maintenance and repair price index and the parts and equipment price index 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim review and settlement process  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and 
table of contents handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various other loss management initiatives underway  contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually determined to be credible  and reserves are increased accordingly 
the very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates  and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors  limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of data elements 
however  by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types  comprising auto injury losses  auto physical damage losses and homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty since reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophe losses  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes  and medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter 
reserves for catastrophe losses property liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  winter storms  tornadoes  hailstorms  wildfires  tropical storms  hurricanes  earthquakes and volcanoes 
we are also exposed to man made catastrophic events  such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophe losses also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described above 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to 
table of contents mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe 
as an example  in to complete an estimate for certain areas affected by hurricane katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff  or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive  we relied on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total pif  as well as visual  governmental and third party information  including aerial photos  area observations  and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available 
potential reserve estimate variability the aggregation of numerous micro level estimates for each business segment  line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  and major states or groups of states for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates  there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level 
given the numerous micro level estimates for reported losses and ibnr  management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful 
reserve estimates  by their very nature  are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment  and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim 
accordingly  as actual claims  and or paid losses  and or case reserve results emerge  our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  an actuarial technique stochastic modeling is applied to the countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses  auto physical damage losses  and homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses 
based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements  an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last twenty years for each type of loss 
the variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience  the statistical credibility of our extensive data and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  excluding reserves for catastrophe losses  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be approximately plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
a lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses  which comprise approximately of reserves  due to their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims 
other types of losses  such as auto physical damage  homeowners losses and other losses  which comprise about of reserves  tend to have greater variability but are settled in a much shorter period of time 
although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates we believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils and state  for reported losses and for ibnr losses  and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
due to the uncertainties involved  the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
discontinued lines and coverages reserve estimates characteristics of discontinued lines exposure our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large us companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on large us companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products  workers compensation claims and claims for various other coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 

table of contents in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
how reserve estimates are established and updated we conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure ie claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure ie environmental damages  respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties  appropriateness and cost of remediation to pollution and related clean up costs 
the number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs  and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities  initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims  often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur 
after evaluating our insureds probable liabilities for asbestos and or environmental claims  we evaluate our insureds coverage programs for such claims 
we consider our insureds total available insurance coverage  including the coverage we issued 
we also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any 
evaluation of both the insureds estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment 
this analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel 
based on these evaluations  case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an ibnr reserve  which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported 
as of december  and  ibnr was and  respectively  of combined net asbestos and environmental reserves 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 

table of contents other discontinued lines and coverages the following table shows reserves for other discontinued lines which provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental  as of december in millions other mass torts workers compensation commercial and other other discontinued lines other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary  direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those described above  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
potential reserve estimate variability establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability  availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability  the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  and other uncertainties 
there are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws  regulations  and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure ie claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required

reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation due to the long term nature of traditional life insurance  life contingent immediate annuities and voluntary accident and health insurance products  benefits are payable over many years  accordingly  the reserves are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums 
long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits payable under these insurance policies 
these assumptions  which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and 
table of contents policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued  are consistent with assumptions for determining dac amortization for these policies  and are generally not changed during the policy coverage period 
however  if actual experience emerges in a manner that is significantly adverse relative to the original assumptions  adjustments to dac or reserves may be required resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist  any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
in  and  our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary  primarily due to profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies 
we will continue to monitor the experience of our traditional life insurance and immediate annuities 
we anticipate that mortality  investment and reinvestment yields  and policy terminations are the factors that would be most likely to require premium deficiency adjustments to these reserves or related dac

allstate protection comprises three brands allstate  encompass and esurance 
allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting income loss  a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income loss below  is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges  as determined using gaap 
we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
net income loss is the gaap measure most directly comparable to underwriting income loss 
underwriting income loss should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability 
we believe that they enhance an investor understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the 
table of contents expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income loss as a percentage of premiums earned  or underwriting margin 
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods 
effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of business combination expenses and the amortization of purchased intangible assets on combined and expense ratio the percentage of business combination expenses and the amortization of purchased intangible assets to premiums earned 
effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and operating costs and expenses in the discontinued lines and coverages segment to property liability premiums earned 
the sum of the effect of discontinued lines and coverages on the combined ratio and the allstate protection combined ratio is equal to the property liability combined ratio

we sell auto and homeowners insurance through independent agencies under both the allstate brand and the encompass brand 
we also sell auto insurance direct to consumers online  through call centers and through select agents  including answer financial  under the esurance brand 
our strategy is to position our products and distribution systems to meet the changing needs of the customer in managing the risks they face 
this includes customers who want advice and assistance and those who are self directed 
in addition  there are customers who are brand sensitive and those who are brand neutral 
our strategy is to serve all four of these consumer segments with unique products and in unique and innovative ways while leveraging our claims  
table of contents pricing and operational capabilities 
when we do not offer a product our customers need  we may make available non proprietary products that meet their needs 
allstate is executing a multi year effort to drive the customer experience 
we utilize specific customer value propositions for each brand to improve our competitive position and performance 
over time  delivering on these customer value propositions may include investments in resources and require significant changes to our products and capabilities 
our operating priorities for the protection segment include achieving profitable market share growth for our auto business as well as earning acceptable returns on our homeowners business 
key goals include improving customer loyalty and retention  deepening customer product relationships  improving auto competitive position for a greater share of consumers  improving the profitability of our homeowners business  investing in the effectiveness and reach of our multiple distribution channels including self directed consumers through our esurance brand  and maintaining a strong capital foundation through risk management and effective resource allocation 
our strategy for the allstate brand focuses on customers who prefer local personal advice and service and are brand sensitive 
our customer focused strategy for the allstate brand aligns targeted marketing  product innovation  distribution effectiveness  and pricing toward acquiring and retaining an increased share of our target customers  which generally refers to consumers who want to purchase multiple products from one insurance provider including auto  homeowners and financial products  who have better retention and potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us 
as a result of this strategy  the majority of the allstate brand policies are owned by customers with multiple products 
the allstate brand utilizes marketing delivered to target customers to promote our strategic priorities  with messaging that continues to communicate ease of doing business with allstate and allstate agencies  good value  as well as the importance of having proper coverage by highlighting our comprehensive product and coverage options 
the allstate brand differentiates itself from competitors by offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features as well as product customization  including allstate your choice auto with options such as accident forgiveness  safe driving deductible rewards and a safe driving bonus  and allstate house and home that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age 
in addition  we offer a claim satisfaction guarantee sm that promises a return of premium to allstate brand standard auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience 
our drivewise program enables participating customers to be eligible for discounts based on driving performance as measured by a device installed in the vehicle 
we will continue to focus on developing and introducing products and services that benefit today consumers and further differentiate allstate and enhance the customer experience 
we will deepen customer relationships through value added customer interactions and expanding our presence in households with multiple products by providing financial protection for customer needs 
in certain areas with higher risk of catastrophes  we offer a homeowners product from north light specialty insurance company north light  our excess and surplus lines carrier 
when an allstate product is not available  we make available non proprietary products for customers through brokering arrangements 
for example  in hurricane exposed areas  allstate agencies sell non proprietary property insurance products to customers who prefer to use a single agent for all their insurance needs 
we are undergoing a focused effort to enhance our capabilities by implementing uniform processes and standards to elevate the level and consistency of our customer experience 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand exclusive agencies 
since allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance  beginning in all allstate brand customers who purchased their policies directly through call centers and the internet will be assigned an allstate exclusive agency relationship 
our pricing and underwriting strategies and decisions are designed to enhance both our competitive position and our profit potential 
sophisticated pricing uses a number of risk evaluation factors including insurance scoring  to the extent permissible by regulations  based on information that is obtained from credit reports 
our updated auto risk evaluation pricing model was implemented for states in our pricing strategy involves marketplace pricing and underwriting decisions that are based on these risk evaluation models and an evaluation of competitors 
we will utilize 
table of contents sophisticated pricing to increase our price competiveness to a greater share of target customers 
a combination of underwriting information  pricing and discounts are used to achieve a higher close rate on quotes 
we will also use these factors on our non standard business to offer competitive prices to customers with risk profiles indicating greater likelihood of renewal 
we also continue to enhance our pricing to attract a larger share of customers 
for the allstate brand auto and homeowners business  we continue to shift our mix towards customers that have better retention and thus potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
for homeowners  we continue to address rate adequacy and improve underwriting and claim effectiveness 
we also consider various strategic options to improve our homeowners insurance business returns 
allstate brand also includes emerging businesses which comprises consumer household specialty auto products including motorcycle  trailer  motor home and off road vehicle insurance policies and specialty property products including renter  landlord  boat  umbrella  manufactured home and condominium insurance policies  allstate roadside services roadside assistance products  allstate dealer services guaranteed automobile protection and vehicle service products sold primarily through auto dealers  ivantage insurance agency and commercial lines commercial products for small business owners 
premiums written by emerging businesses were billion in compared to billion in our strategy for the encompass brand centers around our highly differentiated product that simplifies the insurance experience through an expanded coverage single annual policy with one premium  one bill  one policy deductible and one renewal date 
it appeals to customers with broad personal lines coverage needs who prefer an independent agent 
as part of its package policy strategy  encompass is focused on increased agency engagement through ease of doing business initiatives and increased package commissions  and de emphasizing mono line auto and property products 
our strategy for the esurance brand focuses on self directed and web savvy consumers 
to best serve these customers  esurance develops its technology and website to continuously improve its hassle free purchase and claims experience 
esurance began offering renters insurance in and plans to continue to broaden its product offerings 
esurance is also focused on increasing its preferred driver mix  while raising advertising investment and marketing effectiveness to support growth 
we continue to manage our property catastrophe exposure with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability of our earnings 
our property business includes personal homeowners  commercial property and other property insurance lines 
as of december   we are below our goal to have no more than a likelihood of exceeding average annual aggregate catastrophe losses by billion  net of reinsurance  from hurricanes and earthquakes  based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available 
the use of different assumptions and updates to industry models could materially change the projected loss 
our growth strategies include areas previously restricted where we believe we can earn an appropriate return for the risk and as a result we may move closer to our goal in the future 
in addition  we have exposure to severe weather events which impact catastrophe losses 
property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes  earthquakes  wildfires  fires following earthquakes and other catastrophes 
we are also working for changes in the regulatory environment  including recognizing the need for better catastrophe preparedness  improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions for mega catastrophes that will make insurance more available and affordable 
pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe  are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
we pursue rate increases where indicated  taking into consideration potential customer disruption  the impact on our ability to market our auto lines  regulatory limitations  our competitive position and profitability  using a methodology that appropriately addresses the changing costs of losses from catastrophes such as severe weather and the net cost of reinsurance 
allstate protection outlook allstate protection will continue to focus on its strategy of offering differentiated products and services to our target customers while maintaining pricing discipline 

table of contents we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results  however  this volatility will be mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions  including the purchase of reinsurance 
we will continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced

over time  we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
limitations include our participation in various state facilities  such as the california earthquake authority cea  which provides insurance for california earthquake losses  the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf  which provides reimbursements to participating insurers for certain qualifying florida hurricane losses  and other state facilities  such as wind pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values  and the effect of state insurance laws and regulations 
in addition  in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools  we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and to assessments from these facilities 
we have continued to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events while continuing to meet the needs of our customers  including the following selectively not offering continuing coverage of homeowners policies in coastal areas of certain states 
this includes new york and new jersey where our homeowners pif decreased and  respectively  since increased capacity in our brokerage platform for customers not offered a renewal 
north light expanded to new states in  bringing the total number of active states to in texas we have been ceding wind exposure related to insured property located in wind pool eligible areas along the coast including the galveston islands 
we ceased writing new homeowners business in california in we continue to renew current policyholders 
we ceased writing new homeowners business in florida in beyond a modest stance for existing customers who replace their currently insured home with an acceptable property 
the encompass companies operating in florida withdrew from the property lines in tropical cyclone deductibles are in place for a large portion of coastal insured properties though contract language varies across states and companies  allowing for these higher deductibles to be triggered differently across our customer base 
we have additional catastrophe exposure  beyond the property lines  for auto customers who have purchased physical damage coverage 
auto physical damage coverage generally includes coverage for flood related loss 
we manage this additional exposure through inclusion of auto losses in our nationwide reinsurance program which excludes new jersey and florida 
hurricanes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes generally to be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states 
usually  the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than in other areas 
however  average premiums are often not considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss 
in addition and as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements  in various states allstate is subject to assessments from assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations providing insurance for wind related property losses 

table of contents we have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by  among other actions  purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in areas most exposed to hurricanes  limiting personal homeowners new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states  implementing tropical cyclone deductibles where appropriate  and not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states 
we continue to seek appropriate returns for the risks we write 
this may require further actions  similar to those already taken  in geographies where we are not getting appropriate returns 
however  we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where we achieve adequate returns and do not materially increase our hurricane risk 
earthquakes actions taken to reduce our exposure from earthquake coverage are substantially complete 
these actions included purchasing reinsurance on a countrywide basis and in the state of kentucky  no longer offering new optional earthquake coverage in most states  removing optional earthquake coverage upon renewal in most states  and entering into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through other insurers for new and renewal business 
we expect to retain approximately  pif with earthquake coverage due to regulatory and other reasons 
we also will continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses  including our auto policies  and to fires following earthquakes 
allstate policyholders in the state of california are offered coverage through the cea  a privately financed  publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage 
allstate is subject to assessments from the cea under certain circumstances as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements 
fires following earthquakes actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in california  purchasing reinsurance for kentucky personal lines property risks  and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance  excluding florida and new jersey 
wildfires actions we are taking to reduce our risk of loss from wildfires include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in certain states and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance

see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a for a more detailed discussion 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos and or environmental losses in the future 
these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site cleanup 
because of our annual review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
we continue to be encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity has slowed  perhaps reflecting various state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims 
property liability investment results net investment income increased to billion in from billion in  after increasing in compared to the increase was primarily due to income from limited partnerships and higher average investment balances  partially offset by lower fixed income yields 
we continue to reduce interest rate risk by selling longer term fixed income securities and investing the proceeds in securities with shorter maturities  resulting in realized capital gains and lower net investment income  and positioning for reinvestment when interest rates rise 
the increase was primarily due to higher yields  partially offset by lower average investment balances

property liability claims and claims expense reserves property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
for a description of our reserve process  see note of the consolidated financial statements and for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates  see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md a 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
the facts and circumstances leading to our reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are likely different than those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
as of december   the impact of a reserve reestimation corresponding to a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately million in net income 
we believe the net loss reserves for allstate protection exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws and regulations

table of contents these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as described above  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations

the adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio 
discontinued lines and coverages we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by policyholders

reserve additions for asbestos in were primarily for products related coverage 
the reserve additions for environmental in were primarily related to site specific remediations where the clean up cost estimates and responsibility for the clean up were more fully determined 
normal environmental claim activity resulted in essentially no change in estimated reserves for the reserve additions for environmental in 
table of contents were primarily related to site specific remediations where the clean up cost estimates and responsibility for the clean up were more fully determined

this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
in both and  the asbestos net year survival ratio increased due to lower average annual payments 
the environmental net year survival ratio increased in both and due to lower average annual payments

we purchase significant reinsurance to manage our aggregate countrywide exposure to an acceptable level 
the price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process  along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders 
we also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including industry pools and facilities  which are backed by the financial resources of the property liability insurance company market participants  and have historically purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers

reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements  including incurred but not reported unpaid losses 
we calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement  including an estimate of how ibnr losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement 
we also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements 
accordingly  our estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserves for property liability claims and claims expense 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this amount represents and of the related reinsurance recoverable balances as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  and other relevant factors 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
we employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
we also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants  and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
there has also been consolidation activity in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be 
table of contents concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  some companies have segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectability of reinsurance recoverables in the future 
the effects of reinsurance ceded on our property liability premiums earned and claims and claims expense for the years ended december are summarized in the following table 
in millions ceded property liability premiums earned ceded property liability claims and claims expense industry pool and facilities mcca national flood insurance program fhcf other subtotal industry pools and facilities other ceded property liability claims and claims expense in  ceded property liability premiums earned decreased million compared to  primarily due to decreased premiums in our catastrophe reinsurance program 
in  ceded property liability premiums earned increased million compared to year  primarily due to higher premium rates and an increase in policies written for the national flood insurance program 
ceded property liability claims and claims expense increased in primarily due to amounts ceded to the national flood insurance program related to sandy  reserve increases in the mcca program  and amounts ceded under our catastrophe reinsurance program related to sandy 
the reserve increases in the mcca program are attributable to an increased recognition of longer term paid loss trends 
the paid loss trends are rising due to increased costs in medical and attendant care and increased longevity of claimants 
ceded property liability claims and claims expense increased in primarily due to reserve increases in the mcca program and an increase in claim activity on the national flood insurance program due to multiple flooding events throughout the year 
for a detailed description of the mcca  fhcf and lloyd  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   other than the recoverable balances listed in the table above  no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single property liability reinsurer was in excess of million 
we enter into certain intercompany insurance and reinsurance transactions for the property liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities 
these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
catastrophe reinsurance our catastrophe reinsurance program is designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide 
our program is designed to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes including hurricanes  windstorms  hail  tornados  fires following earthquakes  earthquakes and wildfires 
these reinsurance agreements are part of our catastrophe management strategy  which is intended to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business  and to reduce variability of earnings  while providing protection to our customers 
we anticipate completing the placement of our catastrophe reinsurance program in march we expect the program will be similar to our catastrophe reinsurance program

we serve our customers through allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists  workplace distribution and non proprietary distribution channels 
allstate financial brings value to the allstate corporation in three principal ways through profitable growth  by bringing new customers to allstate  and by improving the economics of the protection business through increased customer loyalty and stronger customer relationships based on cross selling allstate financial products to existing customers 
allstate financial strategy is focused on expanding allstate customer relationships  growing our underwritten product sales through allstate exclusive agencies and allstate benefits our workplace distribution business  improving returns on and reducing our exposure to spread based products  and emphasizing capital efficiency and shareholder returns 
our products include interest sensitive  traditional and variable life insurance  voluntary accident and health insurance  fixed annuities such as deferred and immediate annuities  and funding agreements backing medium term notes  which we most recently offered in our products are sold through multiple distribution channels including allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists  workplace enrolling independent agents and  to a lesser extent  independent master brokerage agencies  specialized structured settlement brokers  and directly through call centers and the internet 
our institutional product line consists of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium term notes issued to institutional and individual investors 
banking products and services were previously offered to customers through the allstate bank  which ceased operations in we continue to shift our mix of products in force by decreasing our lower returning spread based products  principally fixed annuities and institutional products  and through growth of our higher returning underwritten products having mortality or morbidity risk  principally life insurance and accident and health products 
in addition to focusing on higher return markets  products and distribution channels  allstate financial continues to implement capital efficiency and enterprise risk and return management strategies and actions 
based upon allstate strong financial position and brand  we have a unique opportunity to cross sell to our customer base 
we will enhance trusted customer relationships through our allstate exclusive agencies to serve those who are looking for assistance in meeting their protection and retirement needs by providing them with the information  products and services that they need 
to further strengthen allstate financial value proposition to allstate exclusive agencies and drive further engagement in selling our products  allstate financial products are integrated into the allstate protection sales processes and the new agent compensation structure incorporates sales of allstate financial products 
life insurance policies issued through allstate agencies increased and in and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
during  we introduced a new deferred annuity product that allows our allstate exclusive agents to continue to offer a full range of products that meet customer retirement needs while providing allstate with an attractive risk adjusted return profile 
our employer relationships through allstate benefits also afford opportunities to offer additional allstate products and grow our business 
allstate benefits is an industry leader in voluntary benefits  offering one of the broadest product portfolios in the voluntary benefits market 
our strategy for allstate benefits focuses on growth in the national accounts market by increasing the number of sales and account management personnel  expanding independent agent distribution in targeted geographic locations for increased new sales  increasing allstate exclusive agency engagement to drive cross selling of voluntary benefits products  capitalizing on strategic alliance opportunities  and developing opportunities for revenue growth through new product and fee income offerings 
in  allstate benefits new business written premiums increased compared to our deferred and immediate annuity business has been adversely impacted by the credit cycle and historically low interest rate environment 
our immediate annuity business has been impacted by medical advancements that have 
table of contents resulted in annuitants living longer than anticipated when many of these contracts were originated 
we are aggressively reducing the level of legacy deferred annuities in force and proactively managing annuity crediting rates to improve the profitability of the business 
we are managing the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities to ensure the assets match the characteristics of the liabilities and provide the long term returns needed to support this business 
we are increasing limited partnership and other alternative asset investments to appropriately match investment duration with these long term illiquid liabilities 
allstate financial outlook our growth initiatives continue to focus on increasing the number of customers served through our proprietary and allstate benefits channels 
we continue to focus on improving returns and reducing our concentration in spread based products resulting in net reductions in contractholder fund obligations 
we plan to further grow premiums and contract charges on underwritten insurance products and offer a broad range of products to meet our customers needs for retirement income  including third party solutions when we choose not to offer certain products 
we expect lower investment spread due to reduced contractholder funds  the continuing low interest rate environment and changes in asset allocations 
the amount by which the low interest rate environment will reduce our investment spread is contingent on our ability to maintain the portfolio yield and lower interest crediting rates on spread based products  which could be limited by market conditions  regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees  and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
we also anticipate changing our asset allocation for long term immediate annuities by reducing fixed income securities and increasing investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments 
this shift could result in lower and more volatile investment income  however  we anticipate that this strategy will lead to higher total returns and attributed equity 
we expect increases in allstate financial attributed gaap equity as there may be limitations on the amount of dividends allstate financial companies can pay without prior approval by their insurance departments 
we continue to review our strategic options to reduce our exposure and improve returns of the spread based businesses 
as a result  we may take additional operational and financial actions that offer return improvement and risk reduction opportunities

investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
while taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate  we manage the underlying portfolios based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
we employ a strategic asset allocation approach which considers the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk and return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest 
this asset allocation is informed by our global economic and market outlook  as well as other inputs and constraints  including diversification effects  
table of contents duration  liquidity and capital considerations 
within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
we manage risks associated with interest rates  credit spreads  equity markets  real estate and currency exchange rates 
our continuing focus is to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects 
the property liability portfolio investment strategy emphasizes protection of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
this approach  which has produced competitive returns over the long term  is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
the allstate financial portfolio investment strategy focuses on the total return of assets needed to support the underlying liabilities  asset liability management and achieving an appropriate return on capital 
the corporate and other portfolio investment strategy balances the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio in relation to the overall corporate capital structure with the pursuit of returns 
investments outlook we anticipate that interest rates may remain below historic averages for an extended period of time and that financial markets will continue to have periods of high volatility 
invested assets and income are expected to decline in line with reductions in contractholder funds for the allstate financial segment and as we continue to invest and reinvest proceeds at market yields that are below the current portfolio yield 
we plan to focus on the following priorities optimizing return and risk in an uncertain economic climate and volatile investment markets 
reducing our exposure to interest rate risk by targeting a shorter maturity profile in the property liability portfolio 
shifting the portfolio mix in the next few years to have less reliance on lending to borrowers and a greater proportion of ownership of assets including real estate and other cash generating assets 
managing the alignment of assets with respect to allstate financial changing liability profile

we have commitments to invest in additional limited partnership interests totaling billion and million for property liability and allstate financial  respectively 
short term investments are carried at fair value 
amortized cost basis for these investments was million  million and million for property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other  respectively 
balances reflect the elimination of related party investments between segments 
total investments increased to billion as of december   from billion as of december   primarily due to higher valuations of fixed income securities and positive property liability operating cash flows  partially offset by net reductions in allstate financial contractholder funds 
valuations of fixed income securities are typically driven by a combination of changes in relevant risk free interest rates and credit spreads over the period 
risk free interest rates are typically referenced as the yield on us treasury securities  whereas credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk free rate that market participants require to compensate them 
table of contents for assuming credit  liquidity and or prepayment risks 
the increase in valuation of fixed income securities during was due to tightening credit spreads and decreasing risk free interest rates 
the property liability investment portfolio increased to billion as of december   from billion as of december   primarily due to higher valuations of fixed income securities and positive operating cash flows  partially offset by dividends paid by allstate insurance company aic to its parent  the allstate corporation the corporation 
the allstate financial investment portfolio decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december   primarily due to net reductions in contractholder funds of billion  partially offset by higher valuations of fixed income securities 
the corporate and other investment portfolio decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december   primarily due to offsetting capital transactions 
during  strategic actions focused on optimizing portfolio yield  return and risk considerations in the low interest rate environment 
we increased our investment in intermediate corporate fixed income securities and reduced our investment in long duration municipal and corporate bonds  shorter duration us government and agencies and asset backed securities abs  as well as equity securities 
this positioning  coupled with an increase in bank loans  has reduced our exposure to interest rate risk in the property liability investment portfolio 
while the dispositions generated net realized capital gains  we expect a decline in investment income prospectively due to the lower yield on the reinvestment of proceeds 
we opportunistically reduced our investment in structured securities  including residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and ars  taking advantage of increased valuations and demand 
we also increased our limited partnership interests  consistent with our strategy to have a greater proportion of ownership of assets

our practice for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds is predominantly based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor 
we currently rely on the primary obligor to pay all contractual cash flows and are not relying on bond insurers for payments 
as a result of downgrades in the insurers credit ratings  the ratings of the insured municipal bonds generally reflect the underlying ratings of the primary obligor 
as of december   of our insured municipal bond portfolio is rated investment grade 
ars totaled million as of december  with an unrealized net capital loss of million 
our holdings primarily have a credit rating of aaa and aa 
as of december   our ars backed by student loans portfolio of million was to insured by the us department of education 
all of our ars holdings are experiencing failed auctions and we receive the failed auction rate or  for those which contain maximum reset rate formulas  we receive the contractual maximum rate 
we anticipate that failed auctions may persist and most of our holdings will continue to pay the failed auction rate or  for those that contain maximum rate reset formulas  the maximum rate 
auctions continue to be conducted as scheduled for each of the securities 
corporate bonds  including publicly traded and privately placed  totaled billion as of december   with an unrealized net capital gain of billion 
privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are directly negotiated with the borrower or are in unregistered form 
our billion portfolio of privately placed securities is broadly diversified by issuer  industry sector and country 
the portfolio is made up of issuers 
privately placed corporate obligations contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration  reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities 
additionally  investments in these securities are made after extensive due diligence of the issuer  typically including direct discussions with senior management and on site visits to company facilities 
ongoing monitoring includes direct periodic dialog with senior management of the issuer and continuous monitoring of operating performance and financial position 
every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation at least once a year 
foreign government securities totaled billion as of december   with rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of million 
of these securities  are in canadian governmental and provincial securities  of which are held by our canadian companies  are backed by the us government and the remaining are highly diversified in other foreign governments 
abs  rmbs and cmbs are structured securities that are primarily collateralized by residential and commercial real estate loans and other consumer or corporate borrowings 
the cash flows from the underlying collateral paid to the securitization trust are generally applied in a pre determined order and are designed so that each security issued by the trust  typically referred to as a class  qualifies for a specific original rating 
for example  the senior portion or top of the capital structure  or rating class  which would originally qualify for a rating of aaa typically has priority in receiving 
table of contents principal repayments on the underlying collateral and retains this priority until the class is paid in full 
in a sequential structure  underlying collateral principal repayments are directed to the most senior rated aaa class in the structure until paid in full  after which principal repayments are directed to the next most senior aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full 
senior aaa classes generally share any losses from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis after losses are absorbed by classes with lower original ratings 
the payment priority and class subordination included in these securities serves as credit enhancement for holders of the senior or top portions of the structures 
these securities continue to retain the payment priority features that existed at the origination of the securitization trust 
other forms of credit enhancement may include structural features embedded in the securitization trust  such as overcollateralization  excess spread and bond insurance 
the underlying collateral can have fixed interest rates  variable interest rates such as adjustable rate mortgages or may contain features of both fixed and variable rate mortgages 
abs  including cdo and consumer and other abs  totaled billion as of december   with rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of million 
credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the underlying collateral 
many of the securities in the abs portfolio have credit enhancement with features such as overcollateralization  subordinated structures  reserve funds  guarantees and or insurance 
cdo totaled billion as of december   with rated investment grade 
cdo consist primarily of obligations collateralized by high yield and investment grade corporate credits including billion of cash flow collateralized loan obligations clo with unrealized net capital losses of million

rmbs  including us agency  prime  alt a and subprime  totaled billion as of december   with rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of million 
the rmbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk  but unlike other fixed income securities  is additionally subject to significant prepayment risk from the underlying residential mortgage loans 
the credit risk associated with the us agency portfolio is mitigated because they were issued by or have underlying collateral guaranteed by us government agencies 
prime are collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to prime borrowers 
alt a includes securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to borrowers who do not qualify for prime financing terms due to high loan to value ratios or limited supporting documentation  but have stronger credit profiles than subprime borrowers 
subprime includes securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to borrowers that cannot qualify for prime or alt a financing terms due in part to weak or limited credit history 
it also includes securities that are collateralized by certain second lien mortgages regardless of the borrower credit history 
the subprime portfolio consisted of million and million of first lien and second lien securities  respectively 
the subprime portfolio unrealized net capital loss of million as of december  was the result of wider credit spreads than at initial purchase 
wider spreads are largely due to the risk associated with the underlying collateral supporting certain subprime securities 
cmbs totaled billion as of december   with rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital loss of million 
the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk and has a sequential paydown structure  but unlike certain other structured securities  is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgage loans 
of the cmbs investments  are traditional conduit transactions collateralized by commercial mortgage loans  broadly diversified across property types and geographical area

the net realized capital losses on derivative instruments in primarily included losses on interest rate risk management due to decreases in interest rates 
as a component of our approach to managing interest rate risk  realized gains and losses on certain derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio 
this approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to our overall financial condition 
market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices or currency exchange rates 
adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal policy  the economic climate  the liquidity of a market or market segment  insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and or risk tolerance 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the type of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and controls over risk management activities 
subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees 
for allstate financial  its asset liability management alm policies 
table of contents further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks 
alm focuses on strategies to enhance yields  mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for allstate financial 
allstate financial alm activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these alm policies specify limits  ranges and or targets for investments that best meet allstate financial business objectives in light of its product liabilities 
we use quantitative and qualitative market based approaches to measure  monitor and manage market risk 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk through the use of multiple measures including but not limited to duration  value at risk  scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis 
duration measures the price sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset with a duration of is expected to decrease in value by 
value at risk is a statistical estimate of the probability that the change in fair value of a portfolio will exceed a certain amount over a given time horizon 
scenario analysis estimates the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur under different hypothetical market conditions defined by changes to multiple market risk factors interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices or currency exchange rates 
sensitivity analysis estimates the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur under different hypothetical shocks to a market risk factor 
in general  we establish investment portfolio asset allocation and market risk limits for the property liability and allstate financial businesses based upon a combination of duration  value at risk  scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis 
the asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
for allstate financial  this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the alm organization 
this integration is intended to result in a prudent  methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return  conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of allstate financial product liabilities and supported by the continuous application of advanced risk technology and analytics 
although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the characteristics of our interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issue interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in us treasury yields and other key risk free reference yields 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
the difference in the duration of our assets relative to our liabilities is our duration gap 
to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  annuity liabilities and other interest sensitive liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
the preceding assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
as of december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was a gap  compared to a gap as of december  a negative duration gap indicates that the fair value of our liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our assets  while a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities 
the property liability segment generally maintains a positive duration gap between its assets and liabilities due to the relatively short duration of auto and homeowners claims  which are its primary liabilities 
the allstate financial segment may have a positive or negative duration gap  as the duration of its assets and liabilities vary with its product mix and investing activity 
as of december   property liability had a positive duration gap while allstate financial had a negative duration gap 

table of contents in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable returns across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities within predetermined tolerance levels 
this philosophy is executed using duration targets for fixed income investments in addition to interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps  floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
based upon the information and assumptions used in the duration calculation  and interest rates in effect as of december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would increase the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by million  compared to a decrease of million as of december   reflecting year to year changes in duration 
reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses swaps  eurodollar futures  options on treasury futures and interest rate swaptions to manage interest rate risk 
in calculating the impact of a basis point increase on the value of the derivatives  we have assumed interest rate volatility remains constant 
based on the swaps  eurodollar futures  options on treasury futures and interest rate swaptions in place as of december   we would recognize realized capital losses totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in realized capital gains in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease on these derivatives 
the selection of a basis point immediate  parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the above estimate excludes the traditional and interest sensitive life insurance products that are not considered financial instruments and the billion of assets supporting them and the associated liabilities 
the billion of assets excluded from the calculation has increased from billion as of december   due to an increase in interest sensitive life contractholder funds and improved fixed income valuations as a result of declining risk free interest rates and tightening of credit spreads in certain sectors 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million as of december  to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads spreads 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in spread sensitive fixed income assets 
we manage the spread risk in our assets 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is spread duration 
spread duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to changes in spreads 
for example  if spreads increase basis points  the fair value of an asset exhibiting a spread duration of is expected to decrease in value by 
spread duration is calculated similarly to interest rate duration 
as of december   the spread duration of property liability assets was  compared to as of december   and the spread duration of allstate financial assets was  compared to as of december  based upon the information and assumptions we use in this spread duration calculation  and spreads in effect as of december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in spreads across all asset classes  industry sectors and credit ratings spread shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets by billion  compared to billion as of december  reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of our tactical actions that use credit default swaps to manage spread risk 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in spreads should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
as of december   we held billion in common stocks and exchange traded and mutual funds and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily limited partnership interests  non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes  compared to billion and billion  respectively  as of 
table of contents december  and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations as of december   compared to and  respectively  as of december  as of december   our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a cash market portfolio beta of  compared to a beta of as of december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  quantitatively  an investment market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the standard poor composite price index s p 
based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p increases or decreases by  the fair value of our equity investments will increase or decrease by  respectively 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta as of december   we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by million  compared to million as of december   and an immediate increase in the s p of would increase the net fair value by million compared to million as of december  the selection of a immediate decrease or increase in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined by calculating the change in the fair value of the portfolio resulting from stressing the equity market up and down 
the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if the future composition of the portfolio hence its beta and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
as of december  and  we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and guarantees for death and or income benefits provided by our variable products 
in  we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with the prudential insurance company of america  a subsidiary of prudential financial inc and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk 
equity risk for our variable life business relates to contract charges and policyholder benefits 
total variable life contract charges for and were million and million  respectively 
separate account liabilities related to variable life contracts were million and million in december  and  respectively 
as of december  and we had billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s p we hedge the majority of the risk associated with these liabilities using equity indexed options and futures and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments  including real estate funds and private equity funds  and our canadian and northern ireland operations 
we also have investments in certain fixed income securities and emerging market fixed income funds that are denominated in foreign currencies  however  derivatives are used to hedge approximately of this foreign currency risk 
as of december   we had billion in foreign currency denominated equity investments  million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries  and million in unhedged non dollar pay fixed income securities 
these amounts were billion  million  and million  respectively  as of december  of the foreign currency exposure is in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions used as of december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by million  compared with an estimated million decrease as of december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time  certain part time employees and employee agents 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on 
table of contents the consolidated financial statements 
the pension and other postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time 
any revisions could result in significant changes to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans 
we report unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in the consolidated statements of financial position as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
it represents the after tax differences between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation pbo for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost 
the measurement of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below 
the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost as of december  was billion  an increase of million from billion as of december  the increase was the result of updated actuarial assumptions primarily the discount rates 
as of december   billion related to pension benefits and million related to other postretirement benefits 
the components of net periodic pension cost for all pension plans for the years ended december are as follows in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service credit net actuarial loss settlement loss net periodic cost the service cost component is the actuarial present value of the benefits attributed by the plans benefit formula to services rendered by the employees during the period 
interest cost is the increase in the pbo in the period due to the passage of time at the discount rate 
interest cost fluctuates as the discount rate changes and is also impacted by the related change in the size of the pbo 
the change in the pbo due to the change in the discount rate is deferred as a component of net actuarial loss 
it is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrecognized pension benefit cost and may be amortized 
the expected return on plan assets is determined as the product of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the adjusted fair value of plan assets  referred to as the market related value of plan assets 
to determine the market related value  the fair value of plan assets is adjusted annually so that differences between changes in the fair value of equity securities and hedge fund limited partnerships and the expected long term rate of return on these securities are recognized into the market related value of plan assets over a five year period 
we believe this is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets is deferred as a component of net actuarial loss 
it is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrecognized pension benefit cost and may be amortized 
the market related value adjustment represents the current difference between actual returns and expected returns on equity securities and hedge fund limited partnerships recognized over a five year period 
the market related value adjustment is a deferred net gain of million as of december  the expected return on plan assets fluctuates when the market related value of plan assets changes and when the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption changes 
amortization of net actuarial loss in pension cost is recorded when the net actuarial loss including the unamortized market related value adjustment exceeds of the greater of the pbo or the market related value of plan assets 
the amount of amortization is equal to the excess divided by the average remaining service period for active employees for each plan  which approximates years for allstate largest plan 
as a result  the effect of changes in the pbo due to changes in the discount rate and changes in the fair value of plan assets may be experienced in our net periodic pension cost in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
net actuarial loss fluctuates as the discount rate fluctuates  as the actual return on plan assets differ from the expected long term rate of return on plans assets  and as actual plan experience differs from other actuarial assumptions 
net actuarial loss related to changes in the discount rate will change when interest rates change and from amortization of net actuarial loss when there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization 
net actuarial loss related to changes in the fair value of plan assets will change when plan assets change in fair value and when there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization 
other net actuarial loss will change over time due to changes in other valuation assumptions and the plan participants or when there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization 

table of contents the change in the discount rate increased the net actuarial loss by million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets decreased increased the net actuarial loss by million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions  including settlement charges 
this represents an increase compared to million in due to an increase in the amortization expense for prior years net actuarial losses gain which increased due to a lower discount rate used to value the pension plans 
net periodic pension cost decreased in compared to million in primarily due to an increase in the expected return on plan assets  a lower discount rate used to value the pension plans and a decrease in settlement charges partially offset by increased amortization of net actuarial loss gain 
net periodic pension cost decreased in compared to million in primarily due to an increase in the expected return on plan assets 
in  and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents 
settlement charges also occurred during  and related to the supplemental retirement income plan as a result of lump sum payments made from the plan 
settlement charges are likely to continue for some period in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents 
since december   unrecognized pension benefit cost  pre tax  has increased approximately billion  approximately one third of which arose from asset returns differing from expected returns and approximately two thirds of which is related to changes in the discount rates which have been declining over this period 
as of december   the discount rate had declined over the last five years from to  due to the decline in the weighted average yields of the investments that qualify for consideration to establish the assumption for the discount rate 
also  plan assets sustained net losses in primarily due to declines in equity and credit markets 
these changes in discount rates and prior year asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in a net actuarial loss of billion and amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the net actuarial loss for our pension plans will exceed of the greater of the pbo or the market related value of assets in and into the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
the net actuarial loss will be amortized over the remaining service life of active employees approximately years or will reverse with increases in the discount rate or better than expected returns on plan assets 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from non callable bonds and bonds with a make whole provision available in the bloomberg corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by s p or at least aa by moody on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the credit spreads  yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of december   compared to an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the unrecognized pension cost liability as of december  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income by million as of december   compared to a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the 
table of contents expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of net actuarial loss and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost as of december   compared to million as of december  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million as of december   compared to million as of december  we target funding levels that do not restrict the payment of plan benefits in our domestic plans and were within our targeted range as of december  in  we contributed million to our pension plans 
we expect to contribute million for the fiscal year to maintain the plans funded status 
this estimate could change significantly following either an improvement or decline in investment markets 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the goodwill balances were million and million as of december  for the allstate protection segment and the allstate financial segment  respectively 
our reporting units are equivalent to our reporting segments  allstate protection and allstate financial 
goodwill is allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the third quarter 
we also review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as deteriorating or adverse market conditions  indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its implied fair value 
impairment testing requires the use of estimates and judgments 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill test is required 
in such instances  the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition 
the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for our annual impairment test  we initially utilize a stock price and market capitalization analysis and apportion the value between our reporting units using peer company price to book multiples 
if the stock price and market capitalization analysis does not result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding its carrying value  we may also utilize a peer company price to earnings multiples analysis and or a discounted cash flow analysis to supplement the stock price and market capitalization analysis 
if a combination of valuation techniques are utilized  the analyses would be weighted based on management judgment of their relevance given current facts and circumstances 
the stock price and market capitalization analysis takes into consideration the quoted market price of our outstanding common stock and includes a control premium  derived from historical insurance industry acquisition activity  in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units 
the total market capitalization of the consolidated entity is allocated to the individual reporting units using book value multiples derived from peer company data for the respective reporting units 
the peer company price to earnings multiples analysis takes into consideration the price earnings multiples of peer companies for each reporting unit and estimated income from our strategic plan 
the discounted cash flow analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenue growth  capital growth  earnings projections including those used in our strategic plan  and an appropriate discount rate 
we apply significant judgment when determining the fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
the valuation analyses described above are subject to critical judgments and assumptions and may be potentially sensitive to variability 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent management reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions utilized may differ from future actual results 
declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which may be material to our results of operations but not our financial position 
during fourth quarter  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test using information as of september  the stock price and market capitalization analysis resulted in the fair value of our reporting units exceeding their respective carrying values 
while the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values  the results indicated that the amount of excess fair value was disproportionately greater for the allstate 
table of contents protection reporting unit and relatively less for the allstate financial reporting unit 
the results of this analysis are consistent with both the relative operating performance of the individual reporting units as well as their respective industry sector performance 
specifically  spread based products  which are a material component of the allstate financial reporting unit  are experiencing the continued impacts of the historically low interest rate environment which has depressed operating margins 
in contrast  underwriting results from the allstate protection business have benefitted by the general presence of stable to higher premium rates and stable loss costs 
goodwill impairment evaluations indicated no impairment as of december  and no reporting unit was at risk of having its carrying value including goodwill exceed its fair value

table of contents allstate domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile 
statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity  operating leverage and premium growth capacity  and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings 
as of december   total statutory surplus is billion compared to billion as of december  property liability surplus was billion as of december   compared to billion as of december  allstate financial surplus was billion as of december   compared to billion as of december  the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company premium growth capacity 
ratios in excess of to are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies  and for homeowners and related coverages that have significant net exposure to natural catastrophes a ratio of to is considered appropriate 
aic premium to surplus ratio was x as of both december  and state laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer risk based capital rbc  a measure of an insurer solvency  falls below certain levels 
the naic has a standard formula for annually assessing rbc 
the formula for calculating rbc for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing 
the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
as of december   the statutory capital and surplus for each of our domestic insurance companies exceeds its company action level rbc 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges

the corporation has access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was billion  however  the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily 
our credit facility is available for short term liquidity requirements and backs our commercial paper facility 
the billion unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial term of five years expiring in april the facility is fully subscribed among lenders with the largest commitment being million 
we have the option to extend the expiration by one year at the first and second anniversary of the facility  upon approval of existing or replacement lenders 
the commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility 
this facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional million of borrowing 
this facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement 
this ratio was as of december  although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement  the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured  unguaranteed long term debt 
there were no borrowings under the credit facility during the total amount 
table of contents outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility

liquidity exposure contractholder funds were billion as of december  the following table summarizes contractholder funds by their contractual withdrawal provisions as of december  in millions percent to total not subject to discretionary withdrawal subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges market value adjustments subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments total contractholder funds includes billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a day period at the end of their initial and subsequent interest rate guarantee periods which are typically or years during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment 
of these contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate guarantee of or higher 
includes billion of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to the prudential insurance company of america  a subsidiary of prudential financial inc  in while we are able to quantify remaining scheduled maturities for our institutional products  anticipating retail product surrenders is less precise 
retail life and annuity products may be surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons 
reasons unique to individual customers include a current or unexpected need for cash or a change in life insurance coverage needs 
other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge  the length of time the contract has been in force  distribution channel  market interest rates  equity market conditions and potential tax implications 
in addition  the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re underwritten upon policy replacement 
surrenders and partial withdrawals for our retail annuities decreased in compared to the annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest sensitive life insurance products  based on the beginning of year contractholder funds  was and in and  respectively 
allstate financial strives to promptly pay customers who request cash surrenders  however  statutory regulations generally provide up to six months in most states to fulfill surrender requests 
our institutional products are primarily funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts used to back medium term notes 
as of december   total institutional products outstanding were billion  with scheduled maturities of billion in april of and million in our asset liability management practices limit the differences between the cash flows generated by our investment portfolio and the expected cash flow requirements of our life insurance  annuity and institutional product obligations 
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our senior long term debt rating of a  a and a from moody  s p and am best  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb bb  a downgrade in aic financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody  s p and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic financial strength ratings from a  a and a from moody  s p and am best  respectively to below a a a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities

higher cash provided by investing activities in compared to was impacted by lower net purchases of fixed income securities and higher net sales of fixed income securities used to fund reductions in contractholder fund liabilities 
lower cash used in financing activities in compared to was primarily due to lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on fixed annuities  decreased maturities of institutional products and the absence of allstate bank activity in higher cash used in financing activities in compared to was primarily due to higher surrenders and partial withdrawals on fixed annuities and allstate bank products and lower deposits on allstate bank products and fixed annuities  partially offset by decreased maturities of institutional products 
in  allstate bank ceased operations and all funds were returned to customers by december  for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
corporate and other fluctuations in the corporate and other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements 
investing activities primarily relate to investments in the parent company portfolio  including the acquisition of esurance and answer financial in financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  repayment of debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years liabilities for collateral contractholder funds reserve for life contingent contract benefits long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense other liabilities and accrued expenses net unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations liabilities for collateral are typically fully secured with cash or short term investments 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business  including utilizing potential sources of liquidity as disclosed previously 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  including immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products 
the reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life insurance  immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance 
these amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders 
certain of these contracts  such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to i policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and ii contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as interest sensitive life  fixed deferred annuities  traditional life insurance  immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance  involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts  we are not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event such as the surrender or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  which is outside of our control 
we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts  and renewal premium for life policies  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liabilities of billion for contractholder funds and billion for reserve for life contingent contract benefits as included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension and other post employment benefits opeb contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
amount differs from the balance presented on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  because the long term debt amount above includes interest 
the pension plans obligations in the next months represent our planned contributions  and the remaining years contributions are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans 
the opeb plans obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid 
these liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial position 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been ibnr as of the balance sheet date 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above  especially for ibnr claims 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are our best estimates 
the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december   of billion and million  respectively 
other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding 
certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion 
balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of billion and gross deferred tax liabilities of billion 
these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay 
table of contents these amounts to third parties 
rather  they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis 
in addition  other liabilities of million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain 
net unrecognized tax benefits represent our potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe it is reasonably possible that the liability balance will be reduced by million within the next twelve months upon the resolution of an outstanding issue resulting from the and internal revenue service examinations 
the resolution of this obligation may be for an amount different than what we have accrued 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the periods in which the commitments expire are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional total commitments contractual commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements  limited partnership interests and other loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material intercompany transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required

enterprise risk and return management allstate manages enterprise risk under an integrated enterprise risk and return management errm framework with risk return principles  governance and analytics 
this framework provides an enterprise view of risks and opportunities and is used by senior leaders and business managers to drive strategic and business decisions 
allstate risk management strategies adapt to changes in business and market environments and seek to optimize returns 
allstate continually validates and improves its errm practices by benchmarking and securing external perspectives for our processes 
our qualitative risk return principles define how we operate and guide decision making around risk and return 
these principles are built around three key operating components maintaining our strong foundation of stakeholder trust and financial strength  building strategic value and optimizing return per unit of risk 
errm governance includes an executive management committee structure  board oversight and chief risk officers cros 
the enterprise risk return council errc is allstate senior risk management committee 
it directs errm by establishing risk return targets  determining economic capital levels and directing integrated strategies and actions from an enterprise perspective 
it consists of allstate chief executive officer  business unit presidents  enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers  general counsel and treasurer 
allstate board of directors and audit committee provide errm oversight by reviewing enterprise principles  guidelines and limits for allstate significant risks and by monitoring strategies and actions management has taken to control these risks 
cros are appointed for the enterprise and for allstate protection  allstate financial and allstate investments 
collectively  the cros create an integrated approach to risk and return management to ensure risk management practices and strategies are aligned with allstate overall enterprise objectives 
our errm governance is supported with an analytic framework to manage risk exposure and optimize returns on risk adjusted capital 
allstate views economic capital primarily on a statutory accounting basis 
management and the errc use enterprise stochastic modeling  risk expertise and judgment to determine an appropriate level of enterprise economic capital to hold considering a broad range of risk objectives and external constraints 
these include limiting risks of financial stress  insolvency  likelihood of capital stress and volatility  maintaining stakeholder value and financial strength ratings and satisfying regulatory and rating agency risk based capital requirements 
enterprise economic capital approximates a combination of statutory surplus and deployable invested assets at the parent holding company level 

table of contents using our governance and analytic framework  allstate designs business and enterprise strategies that seek to optimize returns on risk adjusted capital 
examples include shifting allstate financial away from spread based products toward underwritten products  implementing a comprehensive program of margin improvement actions in homeowners insurance  and balancing yield and return considerations in the low interest rate environment 
regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions  all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards there are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented because the implementation date has not yet occurred 
for a discussion of these pending standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them
