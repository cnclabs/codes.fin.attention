the increase in revenue was also due to a million  or percent increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues 
oxford segment revenues for the year ended december  included million in revenue from our cambridge acquisition in april  compared with million in because many of our placements involve capital projects  we believe that one of the reasons the demand for our services has increased with the progressing economic recovery is that more companies have increased their capital spending

the increase in staffing revenues resulted from a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a percent increase in average bill rate

the legacy physician staffing business decreased year over year 
we attribute this to continued uncertainty related to healthcare reform  fewer physicians deciding to retire  current economic conditions and high unemployment which have reduced the number of elective procedures and lowered patient census at client facilities

total sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to percent for the year ended december  compared with percent in the same period in impairment of goodwill 
we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to nurse travel during the goodwill impairment charge for nurse travel was a result of the decreased fair value of the reporting unit due to lowered growth expectations in the later years because of uncertainty regarding the timing of the recovery of the nurse travel industry 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared with million in this decrease was related to the million write off of unamortized capitalized loan costs in  related to the old borrowing facility that was paid in full in december  as well as lower interest rates in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared with million in the annual effective tax rate was percent for the year ended december  and percent in excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge 
the decrease in the tax rate in was primarily related to the year over year increase in income before income taxes for while permanent differences increased  but not as much as the increase to the income before income taxes  which lowered the annual effective rate
