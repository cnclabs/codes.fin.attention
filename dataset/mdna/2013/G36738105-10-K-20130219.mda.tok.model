item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the world s leading vertically integrated producers  marketers and distributors of high quality fresh and fresh cut fruit and vegetables  as well as a leading producer and marketer of prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages and snacks in europe  africa and the middle east 
we market our products worldwide under the del monte brand  a symbol of product innovation  quality  freshness and reliability since our global sourcing and logistics system allows us to provide regular delivery of consistently high quality produce and value added services to our customers 
our major producing operations are located in north  central and south america  asia and africa 
production operations are aggregated on the basis of our products bananas  other fresh produce and prepared foods 
other fresh produce includes pineapples  melons  tomatoes  non tropical fruit including grapes  apples  pears  peaches  plums  nectarines  avocados  citrus and kiwis  fresh cut produce and other fruit and vegetables and a plastic product and box manufacturing business and third party ocean freight services 
prepared foods include prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages  snacks  poultry and meat products 
strategy our strategy is a combination of maximizing revenues from our existing infrastructure  entering new markets and strict cost control initiatives 
we plan to continue to capitalize on the growing global demand for fresh produce and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
we expect sales growth of fresh produce in key markets by increasing sales volume and per unit sales prices as permitted by market conditions 
our strategy includes increasing volumes from existing production and distribution facilities in order to improve operating efficiencies and reduce per unit costs 
we plan additional investments in production facilities to expand our product offering in established markets and continue with our recent expansion in growth markets  such as the middle east  africa and countries formerly part of the soviet union 
we also plan additional investments in our north america distribution and fresh cut fruit facilities to support our planned growth in this market 
net sales our net sales are affected by numerous factors  including mainly the balance between the supply of and demand for our produce and competition from other fresh produce companies 
our net sales are also dependent on our ability to supply a consistent volume and quality of fresh produce to the markets we serve 
for example  seasonal variations in demand for bananas as a result of increased supply and competition from other fruit are reflected in the seasonal fluctuations in banana prices  with the first six months of each year generally exhibiting stronger demand and higher prices  except in those years where an excess supply exists 
in  our overall banana sales volume decreased by while our average per unit sales prices decreased by 
our net sales of other fresh produce were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes of tomatoes  melons  pineapples and non tropical fruit 
in the processed foods business  we generally realize the largest portion of our net sales and gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
during  our prepared food net sales decreased principally as a result of lower sales of canned pineapples due to lower yields and lower selling prices for industrial products which resulted from higher industry supplies 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our net sales are significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we conduct our sales versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus such currencies resulting in increased net sales in dollar terms 
including the effect of our foreign currency hedges  net sales for were negatively impacted by million  as compared to  principally as a result of a weaker japanese yen  euro and korean won versus the us dollar 
during  our net sales were negatively affected by lower sales volumes of bananas  tomatoes  pineapples and melons  principally due to our business rationalization based on our decision to not enter into unprofitable contracts with certain large retailers 
our net sales were positively affected by higher sales volume of fresh cut products in north america and the middle east that resulted from an expanded customer base and improved demand for our products 
also positively affecting our net sales were our expansion into new markets in the middle east 
our net sales growth in recent years has been achieved primarily through increased sales volume in existing markets of other fresh produce  primarily pineapples  fresh cut products and non tropical fruit  and favorable pricing on our del monte gold extra sweet pineapple combined with increased sales volume and per unit sales prices of bananas in existing and new markets 
our net sales growth in recent years has also been attributable to a broadening of our product line with the expansion of our fresh cut produce business  specifically increased sales to the foodservice sector  combined with our expansion into new markets 
we expect our net sales growth to continue to be driven by increased sales volumes across all of our segments 
in the middle east  we expect to continue to increase our net sales of our fresh produce and prepared food product offerings as a result of our expansion in the saudi arabian and other regional markets 
we also expect to increase 
table of contents our sales by developing new products in the prepared food segment  targeting the convenience store and foodservice trade in selected european and middle east markets and to continue to expand our sales of beverage products in the european and sub sahara african markets 
cost of products sold cost of products sold is principally composed of two elements  product and logistics costs 
product cost for our produce is primarily composed of cultivation the cost of growing crops  harvesting  packaging  labor  depreciation and farm administration 
product cost for produce obtained from independent growers is composed of produce and packaging costs 
logistics costs include land and sea transportation and expenses related to port facilities and distribution centers 
sea transportation cost is the most significant component of logistics costs and is comprised of the cost of vessel operating expenses and chartering refrigerated vessels 
vessel operating expenses for our owned vessels include operations  maintenance  depreciation  insurance  fuel the cost of which is subject to commodity price fluctuations  and port charges 
for chartered vessels  operating expenses include the cost of chartering the vessels  fuel and port charges 
variations in containerboard prices  which affect the cost of boxes and other packaging materials  and fuel prices can have a significant impact on our product cost and our profit margins 
also  variations in the production yields  fertilizers and other input costs and the cost to procure products from independent growers can have a significant impact on our costs 
containerboard  plastic  resin and fuel prices have historically been volatile 
during  cost of fuel increased by and containerboard increased by  increasing our cost of product sold by million 
also included was a credit of million in related to insurance claims proceeds as a result of damages that occurred in from flooding in guatemala and an earthquake in chile and million in inventory write downs in central america as a result of our melon program rationalization and write down of packaging material and other inventory in one of our united kingdom fresh cut operations 
during  cost of fuel increased by and containerboard decreased  with negligible effect on our cost of products sold 
also included were million in in inventory write offs related to our previously discontinued pineapple and melon operations in brazil and million in inventory write offs and clean up costs and a credit of million for insurance reimbursements related to floods in costa rica 
in general  changes in our volume of products sold can have a disproportionate effect on our gross profit 
within any particular year  a significant portion of our cost of products sold is fixed  both with respect to our operations and with respect to the cost of produce purchased from independent growers from whom we have agreed to purchase all the products they produce 
accordingly  higher volumes produced on company owned farms directly reduce the average per box cost  while lower volumes directly increase the average per box cost 
in addition  because the volume that will actually be produced on our farms and by independent growers in any given year depends on a variety of factors  including weather  that are beyond our control or the control of our independent growers  it is difficult to predict volumes and per box costs 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our costs are affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we have significant operations versus the dollar  with lower costs resulting from a strong us dollar 
during  cost of products sold was positively impacted by approximately million as compared with due to a stronger us dollar versus the various currencies in which we have significant operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs associated with selling in countries where we have our own sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  professional fees  general corporate overhead and other related administrative functions

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in was million and includes million of credits due primarily to reversals of uncertain tax positions due to a lapse in the statue of limitations and settlements of tax audits and litigation and changes in tax rates in certain jurisdictions 
income taxes consist of the consolidation of the tax provisions  computed on a separate entity basis  in each country in which we have operations 
since we are a non us company with substantial operations outside the united states  a substantial portion of our results of operations is not subject to us taxation 
several of the countries in which we operate have favorable tax rates 
we are subject to us taxation on our operations in the united states 
from time to time  tax authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate audit our tax returns and review our tax positions 
there are audits presently pending in various countries 
there can be no assurance that any tax audits  or changes in existing tax laws or interpretations in countries in which we operate  will not result in an increased effective tax rate for us

for foreign currency hedges  these fluctuations are primarily driven by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro  british pound and japanese yen currencies being hedged relative to the contracted exchange rates 
for bunker fuel swap hedges  these fluctuations are driven by changes in the fuel indices as of year end compared to the contracted fuel indices 
during  we predominately entered into derivative contracts to hedge the british pound  euro and japanese yen relative to our sales 
we also entered into contracts to hedge the kenya shilling  costa rica colon  chilean peso  brazilian real and philippine peso in order to hedge our production costs 
the change in was primarily related to the weaker us dollar relative to the euro and british pound offset by the stronger us dollar relative to the japanese yen being hedged when compared to the contracted exchange rates

we expect that million and million of the net fair value of hedges recognized as a net loss in accumulated other comprehensive income will be transferred to earnings during the next months and  respectively  along with the effect of the related forecasted transaction 
other we are involved in several legal and environmental matters that  if not resolved in our favor  could require significant cash outlays and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity
