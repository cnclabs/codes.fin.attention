we operate our business by geography 
on march   we sold our federal division and on october   we sold our information technology outsourcing practice 
as a result  the sold businesses are now both reported as discontinued operations within our financial statements and accordingly  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows have been reclassified for all periods presented in this annual report on form k to conform to the current presentation 
additionally  discussions throughout this annual report on form k exclude the discontinued operations  unless otherwise noted 
for additional information see discontinued operations below 
excluding discontinued operations  our reportable operating segments as of december   consisted of international and north america 
our ciber international segment  is organized by country and primarily consists of countries in western europe and the nordic region 
the four largest territories are the netherlands  germany  the united kingdom  and norway 
our international segment offers a range of services covering the full it solution lifecycle to both commercial enterprises and public sector organizations 
starting in january  our north america segment is organized into two geographies  east and west 
this structure allows us to maximize our expertise to cross sell and to leverage delivery expertise across our new and existing client base of commercial companies  educational institutions and state and local governments 
in  we also began allocating the costs of our india global solutions center to both our international and north america segments  whereas in previous years  our india operations had been reported as part of our north america segment 
all and segment data has been adjusted to conform to the presentation 
we recognize the majority of our services revenue under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which currently make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract  while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue are primarily a 
table of contents function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour and changes in contract mix 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie  hours per week 
with time and materials contracts  higher consultant utilization results in increased revenue  however  with fixed price contracts  it may result in higher costs and lower gross profit margins because our revenue is fixed 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our typical time and materials hourly rates range from to per hour 
as india based resources become more significant  our average hourly rates will decrease 
for projects which are fixed price or level of effort  where our revenue is not directly based on labor hours incurred  our realized rate per hour will vary significantly depending on success or overages on such projects  as well as the blend of resources used to deliver projects 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of revenue vary by business segment 
close to of our overall sg a expenses are typically for personnel costs for our operations management  sales and recruiting personnel and administrative staff  as well as our corporate support staff and executive management personnel 
these costs are generally not immediately affected by changes in revenue  however management is constantly evaluating such costs in relation to changes in business conditions 
in many foreign countries  short term personnel actions are prohibited and or may require significant payments to such impacted employees 
as we bid on larger and longer term projects  the sales cycle and related sales costs for such opportunities have been increasing 
other revenue includes sale of third party software licenses and related support agreements and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of software generally involve relationships with the software vendors and are often sold with implementation services 
the gross profit margin on consolidated other revenues is typically in the range of to 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit margin on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber services is heavily dependent on it spending by fortune and middle market corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
in recent years  economic recession and volatile economic conditions have negatively impacted many of our existing and prospective clients and caused fluctuations in their it spending behaviors 
over the last couple of years  economic conditions have had a greater negative impact on clients in a number of our international division territories 
the pace of technological advancement  as well as changes in business requirements and practices of our clients  all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
representing approximately half of our consolidated revenues  our international division operates primarily in western europe  with our largest operations located in germany  the netherlands and the uk these operations transact business in the local currencies of the countries in which they operate 
in recent years  approximately to of our international division revenue has been denominated in euros  to has been denominated in great britain pounds gbp and the balance has come from a number of other european currencies 
changes in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
for financial reporting purposes  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates at period end and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period 

table of contents our results of operations are affected by economic conditions  including macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence 
revenue is driven by our ability to secure new contracts and deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges 
in recent quarters and ongoing for the foreseeable future  we have been affected by significant efforts by our clients both current and potential to implement cost savings initiatives 
these initiatives have included going to third party vendor management systems  taking their business to larger  pure play offshore vendors and vendor consolidation 
in some cases  these initiatives have benefited ciber  but in others we have lost our revenue stream entirely or seen a decline in our level of revenues with particular clients 
the pricing environment continues to be extremely competitive 
a number of our competitors are structuring more offshore services into their bids  thereby lowering their pricing to help clients reduce costs  and making it more difficult for us to compete on pricing 
we also have global delivery options to offer to our current and potential clients as possible cost savings  and we are expanding our offshore capabilities and increasing the usage of these resources  however  they are on a smaller scale than the offshore offerings of some of our competitors 
another issue that has had and continues to have an impact on our revenues and profitability involves a much longer sales cycle than we have seen historically  which has been driven by a much slower decision making process in starting new projects in a variety of industries that we currently serve  or in which we are currently bidding for work 
the longer sales cycle increases the cost of our sales efforts and pushes potential revenues and profitability further into the future 
some clients remain cautious  seeking flexibility by shifting to a more phased approach to contracting for work 
we have standards governing the quality of engagements that we will accept with the goal of growing revenue  increasing margins  improving collectability of receivables and delivering sustained  predictable performance 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful with such actions  and in certain cases  these actions may slow our revenue growth 
economic conditions and other factors continue to impact the business operations of some of our clients  their ability to continue to use our services and their financial ability to pay for our services in full 
the impact of project cancellations cannot be accurately predicted and bad debt expense may differ significantly from our estimates  and any such events may negatively impact our results of operations 
discontinued operations on march   we sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our federal division to crgt inc for a preliminary sales price of million  subject to adjustment based on the final determination of the working capital of the federal division at the time of closing 
in november  we reached an agreement with crgt on the final working capital computation  which resulted in a final sales price of million 
net cash proceeds from the sale were million  after transaction related costs of million 
based on the final sales price  we recorded a million pre tax loss on this sale in the loss on sale is net of estimated lease exit costs of million  related to certain federal division office space that was vacated with the sale 
on october   we sold certain contracts and related property and equipment and certain other assets associated with our information technology outsourcing ito practice to savvis communications corporation savvis for million in cash 
in addition  we may receive additional future consideration of up to million  which is mainly dependent upon the post closing success of the transferred customer contracts to be measured based on december results  with the final amount  if any  to be determined and paid during the first quarter of we cannot estimate the amount of the additional future consideration or its potential impact on our results of operations or financial position 
under the agreement  we are required to indemnify savvis for certain losses  if any  incurred by them following the closing under the customer contracts being transferred 
there are no known contract losses at this time 
the ito practice was split between our north america and international business units 
net cash proceeds from the sale  after transaction related costs  were million 
the carrying value of the tangible assets included in the transaction was million  and 
table of contents we allocated million of goodwill to the business being disposed resulting in a million pre tax loss on sale 
effective in the fourth quarter of for the federal division  and in the third quarter of for the ito practice  these business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations and accordingly  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows have been reclassified for all prior periods to conform to the presentation as a discontinued operation 
the following table summarizes the operating results of the discontinued operations included in the consolidated statements of operations 
year ended december  in thousands total revenues operating expenses goodwill impairment operating loss from discontinued operations interest and other expense loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax loss on sale income tax benefit loss on sale  net of income taxes total loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in connection with the planned sale of the federal division  at december   we performed a goodwill impairment test and based on the expected sales price  we adjusted the carrying value of federal division goodwill to its implied fair value 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the quarter ended december   which is included within the loss from discontinued operations of the federal division 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the federal impairment charge 
to report the results of discontinued operations  we are required to adjust the reported results of the business sold  from those previously reported as part of operating income by reporting segment 
these adjustments eliminate corporate overhead allocations and adjust for costs of the division that will not be recognized on a going forward basis 
in addition  we have allocated interest expense to the federal discontinued operation by applying the effective interest rate towards the amount of debt that was required to be repaid as a result of the transaction 
we have also allocated related tax expense or benefit to the discontinued operations 
these adjustments have been made for all periods presented 
effective with their respective sales  operations and cash flows of these sold businesses were removed from our consolidated operating results 
however  in connection with the sale of the federal division  we have retained certain historical accounts receivable as well as certain liabilities 
with respect to the sale of the ito practice  we retained all of the related net working capital assets 
some of these items  including certain possible contingent liabilities  may not be settled for several years 
accordingly  adjustments to such items will be recorded through our results of operations in future periods 
in addition  we expect to incur post sale administrative costs in connection with required government compliance activities related to our former federal business 
for additional information on the operating results of discontinued operations included in our consolidated statements of operations  please refer to note of the notes to our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements included under financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report 
restructuring on november   we approved a company restructuring plan 
the restructuring activities commenced in the fourth quarter of and relate primarily to the consolidation of our real estate footprint as well as organizational changes designed to simplify business processes  move decision making closer to the marketplace and create operating efficiencies 
we currently estimate the total amount of the restructuring charges to be approximately million  of which approximately million will be non cash charges related to stock compensation and fixed asset write downs related to facility closures 
the total estimated restructuring expenses include approximately million related to personnel severance and related benefits primarily in our international division  and approximately million related to the closure of offices and the consolidation of those locations into other existing ciber locations  mostly in north america 
these activities began in the fourth quarter of  and we expect all restructuring activities to be completed by the end of pre tax savings from the initiatives of approximately million in and million in and each year thereafter are expected

table of contents revenue by segment from continuing operations was as follows year ended december  change in thousands international north america other   n m inter segment   n m total revenues n m not meaningful revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or  for compared with on a local currency basis  revenue increased between the comparable years 
this change was attributable to the following international revenues decreased overall  but improved approximately in local currency 
the softer european economy caused revenue results to vary considerably by territory 
revenue growth was strong in the uk  germany  and norway  which comprised approximately half of international revenues 
in the uk and norway  this increase was due to continued demand for it services where we have been successful at providing certain technology specific and or vertical specific services 
germany revenue increase was due to the strong performance of the managed services practice which improved compared with additionally  revenue in several territories benefited from improved sales of software licenses in revenue growth in these territories offset declines elsewhere that were predominately related to client specific issues  which in certain cases were driven by economic concerns  and included canceled  delayed or completed projects 
international revenues continue to be impacted by certain larger european clients focusing on cost cutting measures such as vendor consolidation  offshoring  and increasing pricing pressure on service providers 
in  our largest client accounted for of our international division revenues and of our total revenue 
as a result of a bidding process the client conducted in  we were notified that our status changed to secondary provider from primary provider and  during the second half of  this client began cost reduction initiatives including reductions in the level of services that they purchased from us 
as a result  revenue from this client is down in  compared to we believe revenue from this client has stabilized and we do not expect significant further deterioration at this time 
however  as it is common practice in our industry  our clients can generally reduce the use of our services on relatively short notice and thus our level of revenue may fluctuate and  we are subject to the inherent limitations of such uncertainty 
north america revenues were slightly up during compared to however  excluding the impact of the negative revenue adjustments made in for significant changes in estimates related to costs or scope on fixed price projects  north america revenues were down approximately year over year 
this decrease is predominantly due to service level reductions and completed projects  which were not offset by increased volume and new projects 
this is particularly true for our public sector clients due to recent declines in government spending 
gross profit 
gross profit margin improved to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the revenue adjustments recorded during the prior year period had a significant negative impact on north america gross profit margin 
excluding these adjustments  north america gross margin was relatively flat as improvements in consultant utilization were offset by volume discounts and pricing pressures  especially in our core adm business  as continued economic uncertainty has resulted in heightened price sensitivity from many of our clients 
gross profit margin for our international division declined due to decreased utilization  increased use of more expensive subcontractor labor  and client pricing pressures

international operating income decreased to million from million mostly due to a reduction in gross profit margin which was caused by decreased utilization  an increase in subcontractors and pricing pressures 
this reduction in gross margin was partially offset by a decline in sg a costs that was primarily related to foreign currency and discretionary items 
north america operating income increased to million in from million in primarily related to the prior year negative revenue adjustments for five fixed price projects  as well as significant reductions in sg a expenses  primarily related to reduced management salary and benefits expense 
corporate expenses increased million due to increases in stock compensation expense as well as equipment rental and maintenance  partially offset by a decrease in external consulting and recruiting fees 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased million during compared to the current year includes the write off of million of capitalized debt facility fees related to our senior credit facility that was terminated during the second quarter of excluding the write off  interest expense decreased due to a significant reduction in our average borrowings outstanding compared to  slightly offset by an increase in average interest rates

irrespective of our income or loss levels  we continue to record us deferred tax expense related to goodwill amortization as well as certain other miscellaneous us current tax expense items  which totaled million of tax expense for for purposes of deferred taxes  we estimate our domestic blended federal and state rate to be approximately 
the effective rate on our foreign tax expense varies with the mix of income and losses across multiple tax jurisdictions with most statutory tax rates varying from to 
in both and  certain of our foreign operations benefited from the utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards while certain operations incurred losses without any current tax benefit 
the reduction of foreign pre tax income from to is related to an overall decrease in profitability of the business  including impact of restructuring costs and increased inter company transfer pricing 
although our foreign income before tax decreased by  the related tax expense decreased by only primarily as a result of the shift in the mix of profits and losses across countries as well as increased tax reserves for certain tax exposure items 
for interim periods  we base our tax provision on forecasted book and taxable income for the entire year 
as the forecast for the year changes  we adjust our year to date tax provision 
our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and is subject to significant volatility from year to year

table of contents revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  for compared with in local currency  revenue decreased between the comparable years 
this change is attributable to the following international segment revenues improved by and approximately in local currency 
the majority of our local currency revenue growth was due to increased sales volume in our core territories  primarily for sap related services and expansion in our german based managed services practice  which was a start up business in our strategy of focusing on key technologies and verticals has yielded some positive results in our international segment  especially in the manufacturing and energy verticals in although international revenue growth was for  the segment experienced a substantial deceleration in revenue growth rates throughout the year  particularly between the third and fourth quarters 
the deceleration is attributed to a number of factors such as canceled or completed projects  lack of availability of certain skilled sap resources and economic conditions negatively impacting some of our clients and territories 
the decrease in north america revenues was predominantly due to our inability to sufficiently replace revenue from concluded projects and from reductions in the level of services provided at a number of other clients 
erp implementation revenue declined by approximately million in our inability to replace revenue was due to a number of factors 
we experienced some operational inefficiencies that were created during our transition away from our previous branch model to a matrixed operating model structured around strategic service offerings and key verticals 
additionally  the segment leadership transition during delayed efforts to focus on new revenue growth opportunities 
our weaker than expected sales performance related to prioritizing sales of higher margin  solutions based services  which have a longer sales cycle  and a number of sales members that weren t fully productive during gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin decreased basis points to for  compared to for decreased revenues  lower consultant utilization  and some low margin fixed price projects in our north america segment were the predominant reasons for the decline in overall gross profit margin in the international segment increased its overall gross margin by approximately basis points in  a significant portion of which was due to improved profitability of our german based managed services practice in  a start up business that was in the investment stages for much of year international gross margin was also positively impacted by the full year benefit from a june acquisition 
selling  general and administrative costs 
our sg a costs increased million  or less than  to million for  from million for increased sg a costs of million in our international segment were partially offset by decreases in north america and corporate sg a 
the increase in the international segment was predominantly related to salary costs  mainly for additional sales and recruiting salaries  as well as higher severance expenses 
international also incurred higher facilities and support costs  which increase with headcount growth 
bad debt expense also declined by million in from the prior year 
north america implemented cost cutting measures in the second half of in response to the segment continued revenue decline  which contributed considerably to the million reduction of sg a costs

in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the second quarter of each year  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge in for our former it outsourcing division now allocated to our north america segment  refer to footnote of our financial statements for further discussion while in we recorded an million impairment for our north america segment 
including the impairment charges  we had operating losses of million and million in and  respectively

operating income margin improved basis points in  driven by increased gross margins related in large part to the positive contribution from our german managed services business  which was in start up mode for much of the previous year  as well as the full year impact of a june acquisition 
these margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in sg a costs as a percentage of revenue  primarily for increased salary costs related to business expansion 
north america operating income decreased to million in from million for primarily related to the negative impact of service level reductions and concluded engagements 
low margin fixed price projects and costs incurred by the division to exit several of these fixed price contracts and  to a lesser extent  decreased consultant utilization also reduced operating income 
in  north america operating income was negatively impacted by approximately million from exiting certain contracts or from contracts with losses 
in addition  we estimate that the segment operating income was reduced by million due to cost overruns on fixed price projects that reduced project profits below our expected margins 
north america began cost reduction initiatives during the second half of  including staff reductions and discretionary spending curtailments  but was unable to reduce costs as quickly as revenue declined 
corporate expenses were down million 
during  we incurred million of executive charges and leadership transition costs and we recorded a million bad debt allowance

the effective rate on our foreign tax expense varies with the mix of income and losses across multiple tax jurisdictions with most statutory tax rates varying from to

liquidity and capital resources at december   we had an increase in working capital to million from million at december  our current ratio was at december   compared to at december  our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  available cash reserves  and debt capacity under our new credit agreement 
in addition  we could seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flow  and our available credit agreement will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 

table of contents our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december   compared to million at december  our domestic cash balances are used daily to reduce our outstanding balance on our outstanding borrowings 
typically  most of our cash balance is maintained by our foreign subsidiaries 
from time to time  we may engage in short term loans from our foreign operations 
in order to meet the scheduled principal reduction requirements for the term loan under our previous senior credit facility  we repatriated million of foreign cash to the us in january due to our domestic nol carryforwards  this repatriation did not result in any material current tax payments 
the repatriation reduced the available nol carryforwards which are available to offset future us taxable income 
except for the million cash repatriation  we have not provided for any additional us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we currently do not have plans to repatriate cash in the future and we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such subsidiaries 
effective may   our new credit agreement also provides for foreign borrowings if needed 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries be distributed  an additional provision for income taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future tax expense 
at december   we estimate we have approximately million of us federal nol carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
absent the availability of nol carryforwards or tax credits  the possible tax consequences of any foreign cash repatriation could be significant 
as previously mentioned  we approved a corporate restructuring plan on november  related to the execution of this plan  we had cash outlays of approximately million in the fourth quarter of we estimate future cash outlays of million in cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by used in continuing operations net cash provided by used in discontinued operations operating activities investing activities net cash provided by discontinued operations effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities

changes in normal short term working capital items  partially offset by an improvement in earnings  contributed to the overall reduction in cash from operations during as compared to while in  reduced earnings and changes in normal short term working capital items both contributed to the overall reduction in cash from operations as compared to our working capital fluctuates significantly due to changes in accounts receivable discussed below  as well as due to the timing of our domestic payroll and accounts payable processing cycles with regard to month end dates and other seasonal factors

cash flow from european operations are typically maximized in the fourth quarter 
changes in accounts receivable have a significant impact on our cash flow 
items that can affect our cash flow accounts receivable include contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  client mix public vs 
private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control and  as a result  it is normal for our cash flow from accounts receivable to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
total accounts receivable increased to million at december   from million at december  at december   our total unbilled accounts receivable for costs and earnings in excess of billings totaled million  which was a decrease of million from the prior year 
total accounts receivable day sales outstanding dso was days at december   compared to days at december   an increase of days 
during  we experienced increased dso both domestically and from our international segment 
the increase in dso in international was due to longer client payment terms  which was partially offset by some collection improvements 
our international segment typically experiences slower receivable payments during the first half of the year with improvement in the second half of the year  and with their lowest dso levels typically occurring in december 
domestic dso was higher at december  due to longer client payment terms  higher revenues  and delayed payments from one of our largest clients 
overall project delays have caused increases in unbilled accounts receivable as well 
accrued compensation and related liabilities fluctuate from period to period based on a couple of primary factors  including the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle and the timing of variable compensation payments 
bonuses are typically accrued throughout the year  and paid either quarterly or annually  based on the applicable bonus program associated with an employee role and country in which he or she works 
as such  bonus accruals can fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related subcontractors 
investing activities 
investing activities are primarily comprised of purchases of property and equipment and cash paid for acquisitions 
spending on property and equipment was million during  compared with million in and million in generally  our capital spending is primarily for technology equipment and software and to support our global employee base  as well as our management and corporate support infrastructure  and for investment in our domestic and off shore delivery centers 
such investments will fluctuate from period to period 
in  we expanded our delivery center operations in india  which cost approximately million  and we also made other capital investments to begin enhancing our information management systems and to develop management and sales tools 
investing activities from discontinued operations for consisted primarily of net proceeds totaling million from the sale of our federal division and million from the sale of our information technology outsourcing practice 
financing activities 
typically  our most significant financing activities consist of the borrowings and payments under our credit facility 
this primarily fluctuates based on cash provided by  or used in  our domestic operations during the period as our us cash receipts and disbursements are linked to the revolving credit facility 
during  we had net payments on our long term debt of million primarily from the repatriation of million of foreign cash to the us in january and the sale of our federal division in march  compared to net payments of million and million in and  respectively 
additionally  associated with our new credit agreement  we incurred a cash outflow of million for credit fees  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in  we had a cash inflow of million for proceeds from employee stock plans  
table of contents down from million in and million in we did not use cash in or to repurchase our own stock  however  in we used million for this purpose 
credit agreement 
on may   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na the credit agreement replaced our previous credit facility and refinanced all amounts outstanding thereunder 
the credit agreement provides for an asset based revolving line of credit of up to million the abl facility  with the amount available for borrowing at any time under such line of credit determined according to a borrowing base valuation of eligible account receivables  and a million term loan the term loan 
the full million of the abl facility was available for borrowing on december  the abl facility provides for borrowings in the united states  the netherlands  the united kingdom and germany and matures on may  the term loan amortizes in monthly principal payments of approximately million starting october   with the balance of approximately million due at maturity on november  as of december   we had million outstanding under the abl facility and million outstanding under the term loan 
our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by us and and are secured by substantially all of our us  netherlands  united kingdom  and german assets 
the term loan accrues interest at an annual rate of 
under the abl facility  us borrowings accrue interest at a rate of the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points  or  at our option  a base rate equal to the greatest of a the federal funds rate plus  b libor plus  and c the prime rate set by wells fargo plus a margin ranging from to basis points 
all foreign borrowings accrue interest at a rate of libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points  plus certain fees related to compliance with european banking regulations 
the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to increase during an event of default 
we are also required to pay an unused line fee ranging from to annually on the unused portion of the abl facility 
at december   our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowing under the abl facility was 
the credit agreement can be prepaid in whole or in part at any time 
in addition  the credit agreement  subject to certain exceptions and conditions  requires prepayment of the term loan with the net cash proceeds received from certain events 
these events include  amongst others  receipt of proceeds from a disposition of assets  a judgment or settlement  the issuance of indebtedness  or the issuance of common stock or other equity interests 
the abl facility must be repaid to the extent that any borrowings exceed the maximum availability allowed under the abl facility 
the credit agreement includes a number of business covenants  including customary limitations on  among other things  indebtedness  liens  investments  guarantees  mergers  dispositions  acquisitions  liquidations  dissolutions  issuances of securities  payments of dividends  loans and advances  and transactions with affiliates 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants  including i a minimum trailing month ebitda  ii a minimum trailing month fixed charge coverage ratio and iii a maximum trailing month leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement at december  a summary of these financial covenants is as follows we must maintain a minimum trailing month ebitda  of at least million for january this minimum fluctuates monthly throughout until maturity of the term loan in early november  when the minimum is million 
the minimum trailing month fixed charge coverage ratio must not be less than to the maximum trailing month leverage ratio may not be greater than to for january this maximum fluctuates monthly throughout until maturity of the term loan in early november  when the maximum is to 
table of contents the company is required to be in compliance with the financial covenants at the end of each calendar month until the term loan is repaid in full 
the company is also required to be in compliance with the minimum trailing month fixed charge coverage ratio after the term loan is repaid in full if i an event of default has occurred and is continuing  ii less than of the abl facility is available for borrowing  or iii less than million is available for borrowing under the abl facility 
the company must then continue to comply with the minimum trailing month fixed charge coverage ratio until no event of default is continuing and at least of the abl facility and a minimum of million have been available for borrowing under the abl facility for consecutive days 
we were in compliance with the above financial covenants at december   with the following calculations for our financial covenant ratios consolidated trailing month ebitda million 
minimum permitted is million 
consolidated trailing month fixed charge coverage ratio to minimum permitted is to consolidated trailing month leverage ratio to maximum permitted is to wells fargo will take dominion over our us cash and cash receipts and will automatically apply such amounts to the abl facility on a daily basis if i an event of default has occurred and is continuing  ii less than of the abl facility or less than million is available for borrowing under the abl facility for five consecutive days  or iii less than of the abl facility or less than million is available for borrowing under the abl facility at any time 
wells fargo will continue to exercise dominion over our us cash and cash receipts until no event of default is continuing and at least of the abl facility and a minimum of million have been available for borrowing under the abl facility for consecutive days 
in addition  at all times during the term of the abl facility  wells fargo will have dominion over the cash of the uk  dutch  and german borrowers and will automatically apply such amounts to the abl facility on a daily basis 
as a result  if we have any outstanding borrowings that are subject to the bank dominion  such amounts will be classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
at december   no borrowings are subject to the bank dominion 
the credit agreement generally contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type  including nonpayment  material inaccuracy of representations and warranties  violation of covenants  default of certain other agreements or indebtedness  bankruptcy  material judgments  invalidity of the credit agreement or related agreements  and a change of control 
based on management current estimates  we do not currently believe a covenant violation to be probable of occurring for at least the next months 
however  given the current volatility of the global economy  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these bank covenants 
if a covenant violation were to occur  we believe we would be able to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders 
any such waiver or amendment would come at additional costs to ciber and such costs could be material 
we believe that other sources of credit or financing would be available to us  however  we cannot predict at this time what types of credit or financing would be available in the future  the costs of such credit or financing  or that the terms of any amended or new facility will not be materially less favorable to the company 
the carrying value of the outstanding borrowings under the abl facility approximates its fair value as it is based on a variable rate that changes based on market conditions and the margin applied to the variable rate is based on ciber credit risk  which has not changed since entering into the facility in may the carrying value of the outstanding borrowings under the fixed rate term loan approximates its fair value as market interest rates have not changed significantly since may and ciber credit risk is relatively unchanged since entering into the loan 
if market interest rates or ciber credit risk were to change  we would estimate the fair value of our borrowings using 
table of contents discounted cash flow analysis based on current rates obtained from the lender for similar types of debt 
the inputs used to establish the fair value of the credit agreement are considered to be level inputs  which include inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any reportable off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands principal payments on long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases other commitments total interest payments were calculated based on the terms of our credit agreement and effective interest rates as of december   for our borrowings 
includes operating leases for all office locations  automobiles and office equipment 
other commitments include  among other things  information technology  software support and maintenance obligations  as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation 
it does not include our remaining unrecognized tax benefits of million because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when a cash settlement  if any  with the appropriate taxing authority may occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available to us at the time they are made 
to the extent there are differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
such differences may be material to our financial statements 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 

table of contents revenue recognition ciber earns revenue primarily from providing it services to its clients  and to a much lesser extent  from the sale and resale of it hardware and software products 
ciber consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  general it consulting services  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  training and staffing  and outsourcing and managed it services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and or systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which requires management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials or fixed price billings 
the majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
consulting services revenue also includes project related reimbursable expenses for travel and other out of pocket expenses separately billed to clients 
revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs 
if the total cost estimate exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated loss immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions as to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in estimated costs 
estimates of total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
revenue for general it consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
for fixed price contracts  depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
outsourcing and managed it services arrangements typically span several years 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from unit priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs related to delivering outsourcing and managed services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of labor and other direct costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities  which do not have standalone value  are also deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided 
we sometimes enter into arrangements excluding software license arrangements with customers that purchase multiple services  or a combination of services and it hardware products  from us at the same time  referred to as multiple element arrangements 
each element within a multiple element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided that the delivered services or products have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
we consider a deliverable element to have standalone value if the service or product is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
for our multiple element arrangements  the arrangement consideration is allocated at 
table of contents the inception of the arrangement to all deliverable elements on the basis of their relative selling price the relative selling price method 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence tpe of selling price is used 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  then we use our best estimate of the selling price esp for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
since our services are typically customized to each client specific needs  vsoe and tpe are generally not available 
we determine esp for purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  margin objectives  competition  geographies in which we offer our products and services  and internal costs 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional services or products 
other revenue primarily includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  commissions on sales of it products and  to a lesser extent  sales of proprietary software products 
revenue related to the sale of it products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or if applicable  when delivered and installed in accordance with the terms of the sale 
where we are the re marketer of certain it products  commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop shipped from the vendor to the customer 
our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor 
some software license arrangements also include implementation services and or post contract customer support 
in such multi element software arrangements  if the criteria are met  revenue is recognized based on the vsoe of the fair value of each element 
if a software license arrangement containing multiple elements does not qualify for separate accounting for the implementation services  then the software license revenue and the related costs of third party software products are generally recognized together with the software implementation services using the percentage of completion method 
revenue for software post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month 
unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage of completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings 
such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion 
management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of june each year  or more often if there are indicators of impairment present 
we test each of our reporting units for goodwill impairment 
our reporting units are the same as our operating divisions and reporting segments 
the goodwill impairment test requires a two step process 
the first step consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then it is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required 
if step one indicates that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then impairment potentially exists and the second step is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated implied fair value of a reporting unit goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we compared the carrying values of our international and north america reporting units to their estimated fair values at june  we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit serve as the primary basis for the income approach  and were based on discrete financial 
table of contents forecasts developed by management 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of five years were estimated using the perpetuity growth method calculation 
the annual average revenue growth rates forecasted for our reporting units for the first five years of our projections were approximately 
we have projected a minor amount of operating profit margin improvement based on expected margin benefits from certain internal initiatives 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years  which reflects our estimate of minimum long term growth in it spending 
the income approach valuations also included each reporting unit estimated weighted average cost of capital  which were and for international and north america  respectively 
the market approach applied pricing multiples derived from publicly traded companies that are comparable to the respective reporting units to determine their values 
for our international and north america reporting units  we used enterprise value revenue multiples of and  respectively  and enterprise value ebitda multiples of approximately and  respectively  in order to value each of our reporting units under the market approach 
in addition  the fair value under the market approach included a control premium of 
the control premium was determined based on a review of comparative market transactions 
publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units 
as a result of the first step of our goodwill impairment test as of june   we estimated that the fair values for our international and north america reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by and  respectively  thus no impairment was indicated 
we updated our cash flow forecasts and our other assumptions used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units to account for our beliefs and expectations of the current business environment 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate based on our view of current business trends  no assurance can be provided that impairment charges will not be required in the future 
for the quarter ended december   we reviewed for indicators of impairment and believed that the decline in our share price warranted an interim test for goodwill impairment for our reporting units 
we compared the carrying values of our international and north america reporting units to their estimated fair values at december  we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach 
we used similar methodologies as during our annual impairment test date of june   and updated our business and valuation assumptions for the income and market approach 
the discounted cash flow method income approach incorporates various level inputs including projected revenue growth rates  earnings margins  and the present value  based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate  of forecasted cash flows 
the annual average revenue growth rates forecasted for our reporting units for the first five years of our projections were approximately 
again  we projected a minor amount of operating profit margin improvement based on expected margin benefits from certain internal initiatives 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years 
the income approach valuations also included each reporting unit estimated weighted average cost of capital  which were and for international and north america  respectively 
the market approach applied pricing multiples derived from publicly traded companies that are comparable to the respective reporting units to determine their values 
for our international and north america reporting units  we used enterprise value revenue multiples of and  respectively  and enterprise value ebitda multiples of approximately in order to value each of our reporting units under the market approach 
in addition  the fair value under the market approach included a control premium of 
the control premium was determined based on a review of comparative market transactions 
publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units 
as a result of the first step of our goodwill impairment test as of december   we estimated that the fair values for our international and north america reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by and  respectively  thus no impairment was indicated 
we updated our cash flow 
table of contents forecasts and our other assumptions used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units to account for our beliefs and expectations of the current business environment 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate based on our view of current business trends  no assurance can be provided that impairment charges will not be required in the future 
we currently have a remaining goodwill balance of million at december  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the purpose of our annual or periodic goodwill impairment analysis  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting units  including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units 
we consider our market capitalization  adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  debt  a control premium and other factors determined by management 
as a result  several factors could result in the impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods  including  but not limited to failure of ciber to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated fair values of our reporting units  and a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization  if we determine that the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value of either of our reporting units below their carrying values 
adverse changes in our market capitalization  long term forecasts and industry growth rates could result in additional impairment charges being recorded in future periods for goodwill attributed to any of our reporting units 
any future impairment charges would adversely affect our results of operations for those periods 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate income taxes in each jurisdiction where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as the depreciable life of fixed assets for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is believed unlikely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets impact our income tax expense during the period 
as a result of our cumulative domestic losses  effective april   we recorded a non cash charge of million to provide a valuation allowance for all of our domestic deferred tax assets 
in addition  we haven t recorded any deferred tax benefit for our domestic tax operating losses incurred after april  our cumulative valuation allowance recorded against all of our deferred tax assets at december   was million 
the establishment of a valuation allowance does not impair our ability to use the deferred tax assets  such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  upon achieving sufficient profitability 
as we generate domestic taxable income in future periods  we do not expect to record significant related domestic income tax expense until the valuation allowance is significantly reduced 
as we are able to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets  we will reduce our valuation allowance 
at december   we have federal net operating loss nol and federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
of this total  million of us nol carryforwards are subject to annual usage limitations under us tax rules  however  they do not begin to expire until the remaining 
table of contents nol carryforwards do not begin to expire until our federal tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual usage limits but do not begin to expire until at december   we also have approximately million of foreign nol carryforwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for approximately of the foreign nol carryforwards  as we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize them 
approximately of the foreign nol carryforwards may expire 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes will affect our overall effective tax rate 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits involve proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes  plus interest and possible penalties 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of a tax benefit will not be realized as the result of an audit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the estimates of tax benefits to be realized  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
in order to meet the scheduled principal reduction requirements for our term loan that were accelerated in the october amendment to the senior credit facility  we repatriated million of foreign cash to the us in january we have recorded a million deferred tax liability at december   based on our current estimate of the us tax impact from the repatriation 
however  due to our currently available net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  the repatriation does not have a material tax impact to the company 
the repatriation reduces the available deferred tax benefits available to offset future domestic profits 
except for the million cash repatriation  we have not provided for any additional us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we do not plan to repatriate additional cash and we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such subsidiaries 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for income taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future tax expense 
absent the availability of net operating losses or tax credits  the possible tax consequences of any foreign cash repatriation could be significant 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectability each quarter 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of 
table of contents our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large  credit worthy global blue chip companies and government agencies 
since  as global economic conditions worsened  and we have taken on certain riskier clients  we have experienced a higher number of client bankruptcies  clients with financial difficulties  and clients refusing to pay for services 
our bad debt expense was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  four clients accounted for of our total bad debt expense 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
such items are very difficult to predict and require significant management judgment 
accrued compensation and certain other accrued liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs that are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
in addition  the process to estimate the fair value of share based compensation also involves various assumptions  inputs  and judgments 
we estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and specific claim activity and actual amounts may vary 
in the ordinary course of business  we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to other market risks is immaterial 
during  approximately  or million of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
a portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
additionally  we have exposure to changes in foreign currency rates related to short term inter company transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under the abl facility of our credit agreement has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our abl facility were million 
at december   our weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings of the abl under the credit agreement was 
therefore  a increase in interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the abl facility would result in approximately million of additional interest expense
