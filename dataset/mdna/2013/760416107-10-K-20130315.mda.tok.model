item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to manage our growth  which may adversely impact our financial results 
as part of our retail growth strategy  we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores of other financial institutions 
to the extent that we undertake additional stores openings and acquisitions  we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations  which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income  return on average equity and return on average assets 
other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our management s time and attention and general disruption to our business 
as part of our retail strategy  we plan to open new stores in our primary service area  including southern new jersey 
we may not  however  be able to identify attractive locations on terms favorable to us  obtain regulatory approvals  or hire qualified management to operate new stores 
in addition  the organizational and overhead costs may be greater than we anticipate 
new stores may take longer than expected to reach profitability  or may not become profitable 
the additional costs of starting new stores may adversely impact our financial results 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund our growth while maintaining cost controls  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends 
if we are not able to control costs  such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 
we rebranded republic first bank as republic bank which may be more costly than anticipated or may fail to achieve its intended result 
in connection with our change in strategy to internally grow our brand  during we rebranded our stores and now operate under the name  republic bank  the name under which republic was incorporated and under which it did business from until several companies in the united states  including companies in the banking and financial services industries  use variations of the word republic  as well as a stylized r  as part of a trademark or trade name 
as such  we face potential objections to our use of these marks 
if there are any objections  we may incur additional costs to defend our use  and may be required to further rebrand our banking business 
our rebranding efforts may not achieve their intended results  which include enhancing our brand and increasing our retail business 
our retail strategy relies heavily on our management team  and the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations 
since june  we have been successful in attracting new  talented management to republic  to add to our management team 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our retail strategy will require us to retain and attract additional management experienced in banking and financial services  and familiar with the communities in our market 
our ability to retain executive officers  the current management teams  branch managers and loan officers of republic will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy 
it is also critical  as we grow  to be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement the community based operating strategy 
the unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by regulators  which could have an adverse impact on our operations and could restrict the scope of our operations 
both the company and republic operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental regulatory agencies  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the fdic and the pennsylvania department of banking and securities pdb 
we are subject to federal and state regulations governing virtually all aspects of our activities  including lines of business  capital  liquidity  investments  payment of dividends  and others 
regulations that apply to us are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than investors 
we are also subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by banking and other regulatory bodies 
examination reports and ratings which often are not publicly available and other aspects of this supervisory framework can materially impact the conduct  growth  and profitability of our business 
in response to our may examination  republic and its board entered into an informal agreement with the fdic and the pdb to enhance a variety of republic s policies  procedures and processes regarding asset quality  earnings  and loan concentrations 
as a result of our june examination  we entered into a revised informal agreement  which contained many of the same provisions of the prior agreement with the addition of a limitation on branch expansion  regulatory approval in advance of dividend payments from republic to the company  and increased minimum capital ratios 
based on the outcome of our regulatory examination completed in october  the fdic and the pdb determined that the requirements of our revised informal agreement had been substantially met  and that the informal agreement should be terminated 
on february  we adopted a board resolution the resolution in form as proposed by the fdic and the pdb and our informal agreement was terminated 
the resolution provides for the bank to submit a revised strategic plan and revised budgets for the years through  provide periodic information regarding changes in classified loans  and submit detailed information on any proposed new branch or branch relocation before submitting an application for a new or relocation branch 
we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations 
see item business supervision and regulation 
the requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business  undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing 
financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is within our control 
for example  if adopted as proposed  basel iii and regulations proposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies will require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with the new and higher capital standards 
compliance with these rules  which are still being analyzed  could impose additional costs on banking entities and their holding companies 
management is reviewing the new proposed standards and evaluating all options and strategies to ensure compliance with the new standards  notwithstanding republic s current status as well capitalized 
new programs and proposals may subject us and other financial institutions to additional restrictions  oversight and costs that may have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or the price of our common stock 
federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or enforced 
we cannot predict the substance or impact of future legislation  regulation or the application thereof 
compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs  impede the efficiency of our internal business processes  require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner 
we face significant competition in our market from other banks and financial institutions 
the banking and financial services industry in our market area is highly competitive 
we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and consolidation among financial service providers 
larger institutions have greater access to capital markets  with higher lending limits and a broader array of services 
competition may require increases in deposit rates and decreases in loan rates  and adversely impact our net interest margin 
we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technologies  which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations 
the financial services industry is constantly undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand in our market 
many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
as a result  they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer  which would put us at a competitive disadvantage 
accordingly  we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers 
if we are unable to do so  our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not achieve their intended objectives 
we maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission  although we have not always so reported 
we also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting 
these controls may not achieve their intended objectives 
control processes that involve human diligence and compliance  such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures 
controls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override 
because of such limitations  there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and that information may not be reported on a timely basis 
if our controls are not effective  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and market for our common stock  and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
we are subject to certain operational risks  including  but not limited to  customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors 
employee errors and misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation 
misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us  improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information 
it is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence 
we maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks  including data processing system failures and errors  and customer or employee fraud 
should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence  or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
system failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event  as well as from security breaches  denial of service attacks  viruses  worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
computer break ins  phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage  these security measures may not be successful 
in addition  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data 
a failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we want to  or are compelled to  raise additional capital in the future  that capital may not be available to us when it is needed or on terms that are favorable to us or current shareholders 
federal banking regulators require us  and republic  to maintain capital to support our operations 
regulatory capital ratios are defined and required ratios are established by laws and regulations promulgated by banking regulatory agencies 
at december   our regulatory capital ratios were above well capitalized levels under current bank regulatory guidelines 
to be well capitalized  banking companies generally must maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
regulators  however  may require us  or republic  to maintain higher regulatory capital ratios 
for example  regulators recently have required some banks to attain a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
in addition  as discussed in item business supervision and regulation capital adequacy  in june of the fdic and other federal banking agencies proposed new standards revising regulatory capital requirements 
the proposed rules  if adopted  would establish new higher capital ratio requirements and narrow the definitions of capital 
our ability to raise additional capital in the future will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  on our financial performance and on other factors 
accordingly  we may not be able to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed  our ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired 
additionally  the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect our operations  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us  such as disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry 
if we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities  we would likely dilute the ownership interests of investors  and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of our common stock 
furthermore  a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price 
we are exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to real estate that we have or had title to in the past 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
in the course of our business  we may foreclose  accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure  or otherwise acquire real estate  and in doing so could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before acquiring title to any real property  these may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
if we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities  it could materially and adversely affect us 
a substantial decline in the value of our federal home loan bank of pittsburgh common stock may adversely affect our financial condition 
we own common stock of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  or the fhlb  in order to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system  which enables us to borrow funds under the federal home loan bank advance program 
the carrying value and fair market value of our fhlb common stock was million as of december  published reports indicate that certain member banks of the federal home loan bank system may be subject to asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels 
in december  the fhlb had notified its member banks that it had suspended dividend payments and the repurchase of capital stock until further notice was provided 
in october  the fhlb of pittsburgh repurchased of republic s total restricted stock outstanding 
in and  the fhlb of pittsburgh continued to repurchase up to of republic s total restricted stock outstanding on a quarterly basis and  in  resumed the payment of dividends 
decisions regarding any future repurchases of restricted stock will be made on a quarterly basis 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of a federal home loan bank  including the fhlb  could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  given that there is no market for our fhlb common stock  we believe that there is a risk that our investment could be deemed other than temporarily impaired at some time in the future 
if this occurs  it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if the fhlb were to cease operations  or if we were required to write off our investment in the fhlb  our business  financial condition  liquidity  capital and results of operations may be materially adversely effected 
our common stock is not insured by any governmental entity and  therefore  an investment in our common stock involves risk 
our common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank  and is not insured by the fdic or any other governmental entity  and is subject to investment risk  including possible loss 
there may be future sales of our common stock  which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock  including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
our issuance of shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders 
additionally  the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock  whether directly by us or by existing common shareholders in the secondary market  the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could  in turn  materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
we are party to a registration rights agreement with the holders of the convertible trust preferred securities of republic first bancorp capital trust iv  which requires us  under certain circumstances  to register up to million shares of our common stock into which the trust preferred securities may be converted for resale under the securities act of in addition  our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval  and we may issue other equity securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  to support operations and growth  to maintain our capital ratios and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global market 
during  the average daily trading volume for our common stock was approximately  shares 
sales of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  it may be difficult for holders to resell their shares at prices they find attractive  or at all 
our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and any preferred stock and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and preferred equity claims against our subsidiaries 
shares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and  as such  will rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities 
additionally  holders of our common stock may become subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of any classes or series of preferred stock that our board of directors may designate and issue without any action on the part of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary s creditors and preferred shareholders 
as of december   we had million of outstanding debt 
our ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of our subsidiaries 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
our board of directors intends to follow a policy of retaining earnings for the purpose of increasing our capital for the foreseeable future 
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends if  as and when declared from time to time by our board of directors in its sole discretion out of funds legally available for that purpose  after debt service payments and payments of dividends required to be paid on our outstanding preferred stock  if any 
while we  as a bank holding company  are not subject to certain restrictions on dividends applicable to republic  our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock will depend to a large extent upon the amount of dividends paid by republic to us 
regulatory authorities restrict the amount of cash dividends republic can declare and pay without prior regulatory approval 
presently  republic cannot declare or pay dividends in any one year in excess of retained earnings for that year subject to risk based capital requirements 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  current and potential shareholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  referred to as section  we are required to include in our annual reports on form k  our management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
while we have reported no material weaknesses in the form k for the fiscal year ended december   we cannot guarantee that we will not have any material weaknesses in the future 
compliance with the requirements of section is expensive and time consuming 
if  in the future  we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential shareholders and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the exchange act  which could adversely affect our business 
our governing documents  pennsylvania law  and current policies of our board of directors contain provisions  which may reduce the likelihood of a change in control transaction  which may otherwise be available and attractive to shareholders 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive or may discourage a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our board of directors 
in particular  the articles of incorporation and bylaws classify our board of directors into three groups  so that shareholders elect only approximately one third of the board each year  permit shareholders to remove directors only for cause and only upon the vote of the holders of at least of the voting shares  require our shareholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make shareholder proposals at a shareholders meeting  require the vote of the holders of at least of our voting shares for shareholder amendments to our bylaws  require the vote of the holders of at least of our voting shares to approve certain business combinations  and restrict the holdings and voting rights of shareholders who would acquire more than of our outstanding common stock without the approval of two thirds of our board of directors 
these provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control  even though a majority of our shareholders may consider such proposals desirable 
such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our board of directors 
moreover  these provisions could diminish the opportunities for shareholders to participate in certain tender offers  including tender offers at prices above the then current market value of our common stock  and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts or speculation 
in addition  anti takeover provisions in pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold 
for example  pennsylvania law may restrict a third party s ability to obtain control of us and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock 
pennsylvania law also provides that our shareholders are not entitled by statute to propose amendments to our articles of incorporation

management believes these facilities are adequate to meet the company s present and immediately foreseeable needs 
in addition  the company owns two parcels of land on which new store locations are expected to be developed  subject to regulatory approvals and other factors 
item legal proceedings the company and republic are from time to time parties plaintiff or defendant to lawsuits in the normal course of business

this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  including but not limited to those set forth in item a  entitled  risk factors and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
executive summary the highlights for the year ended december  are as follows we reported net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in we were profitable in every quarter during core deposits grew by million  or  to a total of million during the year ended december  as a result of the continued success of our retail focused  customer service model 
loans grew by million  or  to million at december   versus million at december   driven by an increase in quality loan demand during increases were recognized in the consumer  commercial and industrial and owner occupied real estate categories 
small business lending continues to be a focal point of the company s lending strategy 
the small business lending team originated million in new sba loans during the year ended december  and is ranked as the sba lender in new jersey and the sba lender in pennsylvania based on the dollar volume of loan originations 
the net interest margin remained consistent year over year despite an incredibly challenging rate environment 
the net interest margin decreased slightly to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  non interest expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year as a result of lower expenses related to foreclosed real estate during capital levels remain strong with a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of at december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were  which compares favorably to peer levels 
net charge offs as a percentage of loans decreased to  which is the lowest level the company has seen since the haddonfield  nj store continues to grow at a strong pace  with million in core deposits since opening in critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in reviewing and understanding our financial information  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
these policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of securities and deferred income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies related to the allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of securities and deferred income taxes as being critical 
allowance for loan losses management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on our past loan loss experience  the volume and composition of our lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors affecting the known and inherent risk in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
the allowance is maintained at a level that management  based upon its evaluation  considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including  among others  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans  exposure at default  value of collateral  and estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of specific allowances for both impaired and classified loans and a general allowance on the remainder of the portfolio 
although management determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
management establishes an allowance on certain impaired loans for the amount by which the discounted cash flows  observable market price  or fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
a delay or shortfall in amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired 
management also establishes a general allowance on non classified loans to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular loans 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience  delinquency trends  and management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
management also evaluates classified loans  which are not impaired 
we segregate these loans by category and assign qualitative factors to each loan based on inherent losses associated with each type of lending and consideration that these loans  in the aggregate  represent an above average credit risk and that more of these loans will prove to be uncollectible compared to loans in the general portfolio 
classification of a loan within this category is based on identified weaknesses that increase the credit risk of the loan 
the allowance is adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting its primary lending areas  credit quality trends  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
the applied loss factors are re evaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information known to it in order to make loan loss allowance valuations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  or changes in accounting guidance 
in times of economic slowdown  either regional or national  the risk inherent in the loan portfolio could increase resulting in the need for additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods 
an increase could also be necessitated by an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components even though the credit quality of the overall portfolio may be improving 
historically  the estimates of the allowance for loan loss have provided adequate coverage against actual losses incurred 
in addition  the pennsylvania department of banking and securities and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
the pennsylvania department of banking and securities or the fdic may require the recognition of adjustment to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
other than temporary impairment of securities securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation  to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
to determine whether a loss in value is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline  the magnitude and duration of the decline and our intent and ability to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
income taxes management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  management s estimates and judgments to calculate the deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including the past operating results and forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  we recorded net income of million or per diluted share for compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the net income for was primarily driven by the significant improvement in asset quality compared to  which resulted in a much lower loan loss provision and a reduction of other credit costs in we recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of million for compared to a million provision for financial results for were impacted by a loss incurred on a bulk sale of distressed and impaired commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties which closed in the fourth quarter of return on average assets and average equity was and  respectively  for as compared to and  respectively  for average equity to average assets was for as compared to for average balances and net interest income historically  our earnings have depended primarily upon republic s net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis  setting forth for the periods average assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity  interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates on interest bearing liabilities  and republic s net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets

the tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis of changes in net interest income net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense 
the following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated

the company also reduced its average non performing asset balances through a bulk sale of distressed loans and foreclosed properties during the fourth quarter of the company s total interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  from million for as the company continues to lower the rates paid on interest bearing deposit accounts 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million for  versus million for  an increase of million

the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased basis points to for  as compared to for average time deposit balances declined million for as compared to interest expense on time deposit balances decreased million to million in from million in the maturity and roll off of higher cost time deposits resulted in the decrease in the average rate paid on time deposits of basis point to for as compared to for average money market and savings balances increased million for as compared to money market and savings interest expense decreased  to million in from million in  primarily due to a reduction in rates paid on money market and savings deposits as a result of the aforementioned customer service strategy

interest expense on other borrowings decreased  to million in average other borrowings  consisting mainly of million of trust preferred securities outstanding  decreased million  or  between the respective periods 
as a result of the continued success of our retail deposit gathering strategy we were able to further reduce dependence on short term borrowings during provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the company recorded a million provision for loan losses during compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the lower provision recorded during was mainly attributable to the significant improvement in credit quality in the loan portfolio  along with a reduction in the component of the allowance for loan losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment caused by an adjustment to the analysis of historical losses during the period 
see disclosure under credit quality and allowance for loan losses for further discussion 
the provision recorded in was primarily driven by million of charge offs taken in relation to a bulk sale of classified and non performing commercial real estate loans that was closed during the fourth quarter of this sale substantially reduced non performing asset balances and immediately improved credit quality metrics 
the remainder of the provision recorded during was driven by updated appraisals of collateral associated with troubled loans  which were received earlier in the year 
every non performing asset included in the loan sale  which drove the loan loss provisions recorded during and  was originated prior to december  non interest income total non interest income decreased to million for compared to million for  primarily due to revenue recognized on two legal settlements in which did not recur in non interest expenses total non interest expenses decreased million  or to million for compared to million for primarily as a result of lower expenses related to foreclosed real estate during carrying costs and write downs of other real estate owned amounted to million in compared to million in a significant portion of the write downs and expenses incurred during were related to the disposition of foreclosed properties in a bulk sale of impaired assets which was completed in the fourth quarter of the decrease in other real estate costs was offset by increases of million in salaries and benefits and million in legal fees during salaries and benefits primarily grew as a result of merit increases and higher bonus expense 
legal fees increased due to costs incurred on matters associated with troubled loans 
provision benefit for income taxes the company recorded a benefit for income taxes in the amount of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the twelve month period ended december  the  benefit recorded in was the result of a tax provision in the amount of  calculated on the net profit generated during the period using the company s normal estimated tax rates offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of million 
the effective tax rate was for and for  excluding the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company evaluates the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently  if necessary  in accordance with the guidance provided in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic asc  in particular  applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle  based on the weight of available evidence 
if management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods  a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded 
these determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence 
in conducting the deferred tax asset analysis  the company believes it is important to consider the unique characteristics of an industry or business 
in particular  characteristics such as business model  level of capital and reserves held by financial institutions and their ability to absorb potential losses  are important distinctions to be considered for bank holding companies like the company 
in addition  it is also important to consider that nols for federal income tax purposes can generally be carried back two years and carried forward for a period of twenty years 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets  we must generate sufficient taxable income in such future years 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available 
judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
based on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence  the company determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of december  and december  when calculating an estimate for a valuation allowance  the company assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards as defined in asc as a result of cumulative losses in recent years and the uncertain nature of the current economic environment  the company did not use projections of future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary timing differences and carryforwards  as a factor 
the company will exclude future taxable income as a factor until it can show consistent and sustainable profitability 
the company did assess tax planning strategies as defined under asc to determine the amount of a valuation allowance 
strategies reviewed included the sale of investment securities and loans with fair values greater than book values  redeployment of cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding investment options  a switch from tax exempt to taxable investments and loans  and the election of a decelerated depreciation method for tax purposes for future fixed asset purchases 
the company believes that these tax planning strategies are a prudent and feasible  b steps that the company would not ordinarily take  but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused  and c would result in the realization of existing deferred tax assets 
these tax planning strategies  if implemented  would result in taxable income in the first full reporting period after deployment and accelerate the recovery of deferred tax asset balances if faced with the inability to recover those assets or the risk of potential expiration 
the company believes that these are viable tax planning strategies and appropriately considered in the analysis at this time  but may not align with the strategic direction of the organization today and therefore  has no present intention to implement such strategies 
the net deferred tax asset balance before consideration of a valuation allowance was million as of december  and million as of december  the tax planning strategies assessed resulted in the projected realization of approximately million in tax assets which can be considered more likely than not to be realized as of december  and million as of december  accordingly  the company recorded a partial valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset balance in the amount of million as of december  and million as of december  the deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability 
as the company continues to record consecutive quarters of profitable results  projections of future taxable income become more reliable and can again be used as a factor in assessing the ability to fully realize the deferred tax asset 
when the determination is made to include projections of future taxable income as a factor  the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly resulting in a corresponding increase in net income 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the company recorded a net loss of million or per diluted share for compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the loss for was primarily driven by provisions and charge offs in the amount of million related to a bulk sale of distressed and impaired commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties during the fourth quarter of in addition  the company also recorded a million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets

cash and cash equivalents cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits comprise this category  which consists of our most liquid assets 
the aggregate amount in these two categories decreased by million to million at december   from million at december  the decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in deposit balances  growth in outstanding loan balances and the purchase of investment securities during loans held for sale loans held for sale are comprised of loans guaranteed by the us small business administration sba which the company usually originates with the intention of selling in the future

therefore  for substantially all financial instruments  the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated 
the estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year ends and have not been re evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates 
as such  the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year end 
the company follows the guidance issued under asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements 
asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under asc are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active  or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable ie  supported with little or no market activity 
an asset or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the fair value of securities available for sale carried at fair value and held to maturity carried at amortized cost are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges level  or matrix pricing level  which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices 
for certain securities  which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence level 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
management s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain level investments 
internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker dealers where available were used to support fair values of certain level investments 
the types of instruments valued based on matrix pricing in active markets include all of the us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and corporate bonds 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as required by asc  we do not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments 
level is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
subsequent to inception  management only changes level inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
the level investment securities classified as available for sale are primarily comprised of various issues of trust preferred securities and a single corporate bond 
the trust preferred securities are pools of similar securities that are grouped into an asset structure commonly referred to as collateralized debt obligations cdos which consist of the debt instruments of various banks  diversified by the number of participants in the security as well as geographically 
these securities are performing according to terms  however the secondary market for such securities has become inactive  and such securities are therefore classified as level securities 
the fair value analysis does not reflect or represent the actual terms or prices at which any party could purchase the securities 
there is currently no secondary market for the securities and there can be no assurance that any secondary market for the securities will develop

the calculations used to determine fair value are based on the attributes of the trust preferred securities  the financial condition of the issuers of the trust preferred securities  and market based assumptions 
the intex cdo deal model library was utilized to obtain information regarding the attributes of each security and its specific collateral as of december  and december  financial information on the issuers was also obtained from bloomberg  the fdic  the office of thrift supervision and snl financial 
both published and unpublished industry sources were utilized in estimating fair value 
such information includes loan prepayment speed assumptions  discount rates  default rates  and loss severity percentages 
due to the current state of the global capital and financial markets  the fair market valuation is subject to greater uncertainty that would otherwise exist 
a detailed explanation of the assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of the cdos can be found in note fair value measurements and fair values of financial investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair market valuation for each cdo was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the cash flows are primarily dependent on the estimated speeds at which the trust preferred securities are expected to prepay  the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to defer payments  the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to default  and the severity of the losses on securities that do default 
prepayment assumptions 
cdos generally allow for prepayments without a prepayment penalty any time after five years 
due to the lack of new cdos and the relative poor conditions of the financial institution industry  the rates of voluntary prepayments are estimated at for both december  and prepayments affect the securities in three ways 
first  prepayments lower the absolute amount of excess spread  an important credit enhancement 
second  the prepayments are directed to the senior tranches  the effect of which is to increase the overcollateralization of the mezzanine layer  the layer at which the company is located in each of the securities 
however  the prepayments can lead to adverse selection in which the strongest institutions have prepaid  leaving the weaker institutions in the pool  thus mitigating the effect of the increased overcollateralization 
third  prepayments can limit the numeric and geographic diversity of the pool  leading to concentration risks 
deferral and default rates 
bank pooled trust preferred securities include a provision that allows the issuing bank to defer interest payments for up to five years 
the estimates for the rates of deferral are based on the financial condition of the trust preferred issuers in the pool 
estimates for the conditional default rates are based on the bank pooled trust preferred securities themselves as well as the financial condition of the trust preferred issuers in the pool 
estimates for the near term rates of deferral and conditional default are based on key financial ratios relating to the financial institutions capitalization  asset quality  profitability and liquidity 
each bank in each security is evaluated based on ratings from outside services including standard poors  moody s  fitch  bankrate 
com and the street 
com 
recent stock price information is considered  as well as the week high and low  for each bank in each security 
also  the receipt and repayment of tarp funding is considered  and if so  the amount 
finally  each bank s ability to generate capital internally or externally  which is predictive of a troubled bank s ability to recover  is considered 
loss severity 
the fact that an issuer defaults on a loan  does not necessarily mean that the investor will lose all of their investment 
thus  it is important to understand not only the default assumption  but also the expected loss given a default  or the loss severity assumption 
both standard poors and moody s analytics have performed and published research that indicates that recoveries on cdos are low less than 
the loss severity estimates are estimated at a range of to 
bond waterfall 
the cdos have several tranches senior tranches  mezzanine tranches and the residual or income tranches 
the company invested in the mezzanine tranches in each of the cdos currently in the investment securities portfolio 
the senior and mezzanine tranches were overcollateralized at issuance  meaning that the par value of the underlying collateral was more than the balance issued on the tranches 
the terms generally provide that if the performing collateral balances fall below certain triggers  then income is diverted from the residual tranches to pay the senior and mezzanine tranches 
however  if significant deferrals occur  income could also be diverted from the mezzanine tranches to pay the senior tranches 
the intex desktop model calculates collateral cash flows based on the attributes of the cdos as of the collateral cut off date of december  and certain valuation input assumptions for the underlying collateral 
allocations of the cash flows to securities are based on the overcollateralization and interest coverage tests triggers  events of default and liquidation  deferrals of interest  mandatory auction calls  optional redemptions and any interest rate hedge agreements 
internal rate of return 
internal rates of return are the pre tax yield rates used to discount the future cash flow stream expected from the collateral cash flow 
the marketplace for the cdos at december  and december  was not active 
this is evidenced by a significant widening of the bid ask spreads the markets in which the cdos trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the new issue market is also inactive and few new trust preferred securities have been issued since increases decreases in actual or expected issuer defaults tend to decrease increase the fair value of the company s senior and mezzanine tranches of cdos 
the values of the company s mezzanine tranches of cdos are also affected by expected future interest rates 
however  due to the structure of each security  timing of cash flows  and secondary effects on the financial performance of the underlying issuers  the effects of changes in future interest rates on the fair value of the company s holdings are not quantifiably estimable 
asc provides guidance on the discount rates to be used when a market is not active 
the discount rate should take into account the time value of money  price for bearing the uncertainty in the cash flows and other case specific factors that would be considered by market participants  including a liquidity adjustment 
the discount rate used is a libor month and libor month forward looking curve plus a range of to basis points 
also included in level investment securities classified as available for sale is a single issue corporate bond transferred from level in since the bond is not actively traded 
impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer  which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuer s financial statements 
the issuer is a well capitalized financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital  when necessary  through the public capital markets 
the fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through bloomberg

there were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at december the majority of loans outstanding are with borrowers in our marketplace  philadelphia and surrounding suburbs  including southern new jersey 
in addition  we have loans to customers whose assets and businesses are concentrated in real estate 
repayment of our loans is in part dependent upon general economic conditions affecting our market place and specific industries 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral varies but primarily includes residential  commercial and income producing properties 
at december   we had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to lessors of nonresidential real estate in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  and lessors of residential real estate in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to multiple numbers of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions

a committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the board of directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained  while approving the majority of commercial loans 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment of principal and or interest in full is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
while a loan is classified as non accrual  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
for non accrual loans  which have been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered

problem loans can consist of loans that are performing  but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms 
at december   all identified problem loans  included in the preceding table  are internally classified and have been evaluated for a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses see allowance for loan losses 
non performing assets increased by million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase primarily resulted from one significant loan relationship that transferred to non accrual status with a balance of million at december  this relationship is backed by adequate collateral to support the current carrying value of the loan 
the following summary shows the impact on interest income of non accrual loans  subsequent to being placed on non accrual for the periods indicated for the year ended december  interest income that would have been recorded had the loans been in accordance with their original terms interest income included in net income allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company evaluates the need to establish an allowance against loan losses on a quarterly basis 
when an increase in this allowance is necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three components 
the first component is allocated to individually evaluated loans found to be impaired and is calculated in accordance with asc the second component is allocated to all other loans that are not individually identified as impaired pursuant to asc non impaired loans 
this component is calculated for all non impaired loans on a collective basis in accordance with asc the third component is an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management s estimation process 
the company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge off on a quarterly basis 
management regularly monitors the condition of borrowers and assesses both internal and external factors in determining whether any loan relationships have deteriorated 
any loan rated as substandard or lower will have an individual collateral evaluation analysis prepared to determine if a deficiency exists 
we first evaluate the primary repayment source 
if the primary repayment source is seriously inadequate and unlikely to repay the debt  we then look to the secondary and or tertiary repayment sources 
secondary sources are conservatively reviewed for liquidation values 
updated appraisals and financial data are obtained to substantiate current values 
if the reviewed sources are deemed to be inadequate to cover the outstanding principal and any costs associated with the resolution of the troubled loan  an estimate of the deficient amount will be calculated and a specific allocation of loan loss reserve is recorded 
factors considered in the calculation of the allowance for non impaired loans include several qualitative and quantitative factors such as historical loss experience  trends in delinquency and nonperforming loan balances  changes in risk composition and underwriting standards  experience and ability of management  and general economic conditions along with other external factors 
historical loss experience is analyzed by reviewing charge offs over a five year period to determine loss rates consistent with the loan categories depicted in the allowance for loan loss table below 
prior to the first quarter of  historical losses for all commercial loans secured by real estate were aggregated into one group for purposes of calculating a loss rate for loans collectively evaluated for impairment in the allowance for loan loss calculation 
during the first quarter of  management elected to disaggregate this grouping into five separate categories based on distinct risk factors to provide a more detailed estimate for the allowance calculation 
this change resulted in a reduction of approximately million in the estimated allowance required for non impaired loans in the first quarter of due to the application of lower loss rates to a larger segment of the commercial real estate portfolio with a lower risk profile 
the factors supporting the allowance for loan losses do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio  respectively 
the company s principal focus  therefore  is on the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by banking regulators 
the company s primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the allowance for loan losses and make assessments regarding the adequacy and the methodology employed in their determination 
a detailed analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the years ended december     and is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate construction and land development commercial and industrial owner occupied real estate consumer and other residential mortgage total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate construction and land development commercial and industrial owner occupied real estate consumer and other tax refund loans residential mortgage total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of period average loans outstanding as a percent of average loans net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses to total loans  net of unearned income total non performing loans includes non accruing loans 
the company recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of million for compared to a million provision for the decrease in the provision recorded in was driven by a significant improvement in asset quality year over year 
in the fourth quarter we completed a bulk sale of distressed loans and foreclosed properties which drove a substantial portion of the provision recorded in in addition  a reduction in the allowance required for non impaired loans as described above resulted in a decrease to the loan loss provision in the first quarter the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans coverage ratio was at december  as compared to at december  coverage is considered adequate by management as of december  the decrease in the coverage ratio when compared to december  was primarily the result of an increase in non performing loans during this increase was driven by one loan relationship that transferred to non accrual status in the third quarter the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million in and million in the company continues to examine and closely monitor all aspects of the loan portfolio to assure that credit quality issues have been appropriately addressed 
a significant portion of the provision recorded in included approximately million resulting from the sale of distressed loans and foreclosed properties to a single investor during the fourth quarter of this transaction was reflective of our effort to transform and strengthen the balance sheet by substantially reducing non performing asset balances and improving credit quality metrics through one transaction 
management makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that it determines is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the board of directors periodically reviews the status of all non accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the management team 
the board of directors also considers specific loans  pools of similar loans  historical charge off activity  economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses 
the company s charge off policy was enhanced during to memorialize the factors which drive the recognition of a charge off 
prior to the charge off policy simply stated that a charge off would be recognized when management made the determination that full repayment on a loan or obligation to the company was not probable 
additional language was added to memorialize the factors considered when making the determination on when collection becomes not probable 
the policy now includes wording that discusses the review of primary and secondary repayment sources on a loan  assessment of a borrower s liquidity and length of delinquency 
these same factors were previously used when making the determination to record a charge off 
they are now formally documented in a written policy 
these changes have had no discernible impact on the quantitative or qualitative factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge offs on a quarterly basis 
any loan rated as substandard or lower will have a collateral evaluation analysis completed in accordance with the guidance under generally accepted accounting principles gaap on impaired loans to determine if a deficiency exists 
our credit monitoring process assesses the ultimate collectability of an outstanding loan balance from all potential sources 
when a loan is determined to be uncollectible it is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
unsecured commercial loans and all consumer loans are charged off immediately upon reaching the day delinquency mark unless they are well secured and in the process of collection 
the timing on charge offs of all other loan types is subjective and will be recognized when management determines that full repayment  either from the cash flow of the borrower  collateral sources  and or guarantors  will not be sufficient and that repayment is unlikely 
a full or partial charge off is recognized equal to the amount of the estimated deficiency calculation 
serious delinquency is often the first indicator of a potential charge off 
reductions in appraised collateral values and deteriorating financial condition of borrowers and guarantors are factors considered when evaluating potential charge offs 
the likelihood of possible recoveries or improvements in a borrower s financial condition is also assessed when considering a charge off 
partial charge offs of non performing and impaired loans can significantly reduce the coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics due to the fact that the balance of the allowance for loan losses will be reduced while still carrying the remainder of a non performing loan balance in the impaired loan category 
the amount of non performing loans for which there were partial charge offs during the year amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  the company s charge off policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary 
during the twelve months ended december   there have been no changes made to this policy 
we have an existing loan review program  which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
a loan review officer who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses conducts this loan review on a quarterly basis and reports directly to the board of directors 
estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult  particularly in a continually changing economy 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at december  however  there can be no assurance that  if asset quality deteriorates in future periods  additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
management is unable to determine in which loan category future charge offs and recoveries may occur 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories 
the allocation is based on management s evaluation of historical charge off experience and adjusted for qualitative factors 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december     and is as follows at december  dollars in thousands amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans commercial real estate construction and land development commercial and industrial owner occupied real estate consumer and other residential mortgage unallocated total allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an amount that represents management s estimate of known and inherent losses related to the loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments 
because the allowance for loan losses is dependent  to a great extent  on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond our control  the estimate of the allowance for loan losses could differ materially in the near term 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are categorized as internally classified 
for such loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
all identified losses are immediately charged off and therefore no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses 
in estimating the allowance for loan losses  management considers current economic conditions  past loss experience  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations  borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows  and other relevant and qualitative risk factors 
these qualitative risk factors include lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off and recovery practices 
national  regional and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various segments 
nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans 
experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff 
volume and severity of past due  classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications 
quality of the company s loan review system  and the degree of oversight by the company s board of directors 
existence and effect of any concentration of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
effect of external factors  such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements 
each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving  stable or declining conditions based on management s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation 
adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation 
we also provide specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance  when the collateral is the only source of repayment 
also  we estimate and recognize reserve allocations on loans classified as internally classified accruing loans based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates 
those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition 
an unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above 
management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments 
these factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions  industry and geographic loan concentrations  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates 
the impact of the above is considered in light of management s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors 
the majority of our loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes  while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans 
we attempt to evaluate larger loans individually  on the basis of our loan review process  which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis and other available information 
even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed  information on potential problems might not be available 
our portfolio of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups 
at december   loans made for commercial real estate  construction and land development  commercial and industrial  owner occupied real estate  consumer and other  and residential mortgage purposes  respectively  amounted to million  million  million  million  million  and million 
a loan is considered impaired  in accordance with asc receivables  when based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan 
impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans  but also include internally classified accruing loans 
as of december   management identified four troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio in the amount of million 
two troubled debt restructurings in the amount of million were identified as of december  the following table presents the company s impaired loans at december   and december  impaired loans without a valuation allowance impaired loans with a valuation allowance total impaired loans valuation allowance related to impaired loans total nonaccrual loans total loans past due ninety days or more and still accruing the recorded investment in loans that are impaired in accordance with asc totaled million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
the amounts of related valuation allowances were million  million  and million  respectively at those dates 
for the years ended december   and the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
republic earned million  million  and million of interest income on impaired loans internally classified accruing loans in   and  respectively 
there were no commitments to extend credit to any borrowers with impaired loans as of the end of the periods presented herein 
total impaired loans increased by million  or  during the year ended december  the valuation allowance related to impaired loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  at december  and  internally classified accruing loans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the amounts of related valuation were million and million  respectively at those dates 
republic had delinquent loans as follows i to days past due  at december  and  in the aggregate principal amount of million and million respectively  and ii to days past due  at december  and in the aggregate principal amount of million and  respectively 
the increase in loan balances to days past due was the result of delinquency in two lending relationships at december  management has engaged in active discussions with both relationships to address these delinquencies and is confident that acceptable resolutions will be achieved in the near term 
deposits total deposits at december  were million  a decrease of million or over total deposits of million at december  total deposits by account type at december   and are as follows at december  dollars in thousands demand deposits  non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing money market savings deposits time deposits total deposits in general  republic pays higher interest rates on time deposits compared to other deposit categories 
republic s various deposit liabilities may fluctuate from period to period  reflecting customer behavior and strategies to optimize net interest income 
the decrease in total deposits to million at december  from million at december  was primarily the result of million in temporary demand deposits received just prior to the end of the fourth quarter of for one customer which were withdrawn early in the first quarter of in addition  we have intentionally allowed high cost time deposits to mature and roll off to reduce our cost of funds 
these decreases have been offset by strong growth in interest bearing demand  money market and savings deposits which reflect our retail focused strategy of gathering low cost core deposits 
this strategy has also allowed us to significantly reduce our dependence on the more volatile sources of funding in brokered and public fund certificates of deposit 
the average balances and weighted average rates of republic s deposits for the years ended december   and are as follows for the years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance rate average balance rate average balance rate demand deposits non interest bearing interest bearing money market savings deposits time deposits total deposits the remaining maturity of certificates of deposit for  or more as of december  is as follows dollars in thousands maturity months or less to months to months over months total the following is a summary of the remaining maturity of time deposits  which includes certificates of deposits of  or more  as of december  dollars in thousands maturity thereafter total off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
we use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
the million of commitments to extend credit at december   were substantially all variable rate commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  dollars in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years minimum annual rentals or non cancellable operating leases remaining contractual maturities of time deposits subordinated debt director and officer retirement plan obligations loan commitments standby letters of credit total as of december   we had entered into non cancelable lease agreements for our main office and operations center and twelve current republic retail branch facilities  expiring through january   including renewal options 
the leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum rental payments required under these leases are million through the year  including renewal options 
we have retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers 
at december   the accrued benefits under the plan were approximately million  with a minimum age of established to qualify for the payments 
interest rate risk management we attempt to manage our assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments 
management uses an interest sensitivity gap gap analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
a gap analysis is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income 
management presently believes that the effect on republic of any future reduction in interest rates  reflected in lower yielding assets  could be detrimental since republic may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  other borrowings and certain transaction accounts 
an increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on republic  due to a possible lag in the re pricing of core deposits not taken into account in the static gap analysis 
interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
we attempt to optimize net interest income while managing period to period fluctuations therein 
we typically define interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities as those that re price within one year or less 
generally  we limit long term fixed rate assets and liabilities in our efforts to manage interest rate risk 
a positive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities re pricing in the same time periods  and a negative gap occurs when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets re pricing in the same time periods 
a negative gap ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates  and a positive gap ratio suggests the converse 
static gap analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time  however  it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about re pricing certain categories of assets and liabilities 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis  assets and liabilities are stated at their contractual maturity  estimated likely call date  or earliest re pricing opportunity 
mortgage backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow  including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends 
savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or re pricing term and can be withdrawn or re priced at any time 
management estimates the re pricing characteristics of these accounts based upon decay rates and run off projections obtained in a deposit study performed by an independent third party  along with management s estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition 
such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental 
as a result of the run off projections  these deposits are not considered to re price simultaneously and  accordingly  a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year 
however  management may choose not to re price liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates  for competitive or other reasons 
shortcomings  inherent in a simplified and static gap analysis  may result in an institution with a negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  re pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap in the manner presented in the table on the following page 
the following tables present a summary of our gap analysis at december  amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to re price  including prime based loans 
for purposes of these tables  we have used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because  statistically  certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date  even without regard to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage backed securities 
the interest rate on a portion of the cdos is variable and adjusts quarterly

such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental 
in addition to the gap analysis  we utilize income simulation modeling in measuring our interest rate risk and managing our interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis the income simulation models management used to measure interest rate risk and manage interest rate sensitivity generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the following table sets forth our npv as of december  and reflects the changes to npv as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated dollars in thousands net portfolio value npv as a of portfolio value of assets change in interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change npv ratio change in basis points static in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a forecasted twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows the nii model as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates in basis points net interest income change change static the net interest income results were calculated assuming a rate ramp  achieving the rate change over a month period  not an immediate and sustained rate shock 
as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 
management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
periodically  we may and do make significant changes to underlying assumptions  which are wholly judgmental 
prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities have increased over historical levels due to the lower interest rate environment  and may result in reductions in margins 
capital resources we have sponsored three outstanding issues of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities 
the subsidiary trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
the purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to of total tier capital 
on december   republic capital trust ii trust ii issued million of trust preferred securities to investors and million of common securities to us 
trust ii purchased million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due  and we used the proceeds to call the securities of republic capital trust i trust i 
the debentures purchased by trust ii have a variable interest rate  adjustable quarterly  at over the month libor 
we may redeem the debentures on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty

the net proceeds of approximately million from this offering were used for general corporate purposes  including implementing the company s retail and rebranding strategies  renovating its existing stores and adding new stores 
shareholders equity as of december  totaled approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  the book value per share of our common stock increased from as of december   based upon  shares outstanding  as adjusted for treasury stock and deferred compensation plan shares  to as of december   based upon  shares outstanding at december   as adjusted for treasury stock and deferred compensation plan shares 
regulatory capital requirements the company is required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and the fdic 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  banks are expected to meet a minimum target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of  at least one half of which is to be in the form of tier capital 
qualifying total capital is divided into two separate categories or tiers 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital includes allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
applying the federal guidelines  the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets was and at december  and  respectively  and as required by the guidelines  at least one half of the qualifying total capital consisted of tier l capital elements 
tier l risk based capital ratios on december  and were and  respectively 
at december  and  we exceeded the requirements for risk based capital adequacy under federal guidelines 
at december  and  our leverage ratio was and  respectively 
the risk based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off balance sheet activities 
failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action 
in assessing a bank s capital adequacy  regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  quality and level or earnings  concentrations of credit  quality of loans and investments  risks of any nontraditional activities  effectiveness of bank policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control risks 
under fdic regulations  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized when it has a leverage ratio tier l capital to total assets of at least  a tier l capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least  and a total capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least 
at december  and  republic was considered well capitalized under fdic regulations 
the following table presents our regulatory capital ratios at december  and actual for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines dollars in thousands amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio december  total risk based capital republic company tier risk based capital republic company tier leverage capital republic company december  total risk based capital republic company tier risk based capital republic company tier leverage capital republic company management believes that the company and republic met  as of december  and  all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject 
in the current year  the fdic categorized republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance act 
there are no calculations or events since that notification which management believes would have changed republic s category 
the company and republic s ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans  the impact of future economic events on republic s loan customers and republic s ability to manage its interest rate risk  growth and other operating expenses 
liquidity a financial institution must maintain and manage liquidity to ensure it has the ability to meet its financial obligations 
these obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the payment of lease obligations as they become due  the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments  and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities 
our most liquid assets consist of cash  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold 
regulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors 
in response to these requirements  we have formed an asset liability committee alco  comprised of certain members of republic s board of directors and senior management to monitor such ratios 
the alco committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity 
that committee s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring republic s interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs 
the alco committee meets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary 
our target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities 
our most liquid assets  comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity 
at december   republic estimated that more than million of loans would mature or repay in the six month period ending june  additionally  the majority of our investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities 
at december   we had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit and letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled million at december  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments 
daily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates  buying federal funds or utilizing the credit facilities of the fhlb 
we have established a line of credit with the fhlb of pittsburgh 
our maximum borrowing capacity with the fhlb was million at december  as of december  and  we had no outstanding borrowings with the fhlb 
we also established a contingency line of credit of million with atlantic central bankers bank acbb to assist in managing our liquidity position 
we had no amounts outstanding against the acbb line of credit at december  and variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation asc  consolidation of variable interest entities 
asc clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under asc if the investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of asc will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management previously determined that each of our current and former subsidiary trusts  trust i  trust ii  trust iii and trust iv  qualifies as a variable interest entity under asc trust i originally issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to us 
the securities were subsequently refinanced via a call during from proceeds of an issuance by trust ii 
trust ii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by us in we issued an additional million of pooled trust preferred securities in june trust iii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by us in in june  we issued an additional million of convertible trust preferred securities 
trust iv holds as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by us in we do not consolidate our subsidiary trusts 
asc precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred stock when determining if we have the right to a majority of the trust s expected residual returns 
the non consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trust to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of  in addition  the income received on our investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the federal reserve has issued final guidance on the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by the capital trusts as a result of the adoption of asc the final rule retained the current maximum percentage of total capital permitted for trust preferred securities at  but enacted other changes to the rules governing trust preferred securities that affect their use as part of the collection of entities known as restricted core capital elements 
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations
