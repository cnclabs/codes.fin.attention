risk factors we wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives 
these risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware 
historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results 
the risk factors below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
changes in general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending could impact our results of operations 
future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels  consumer confidence  credit availability  business conditions  stock market volatility  inflation  acts of terrorism  threats of war  and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products 
if the economic conditions and performance of the retail and media environment worsen  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
increased competition could impact our financial results we believe that the lohas market includes thousands of small  local and regional businesses 
some smaller businesses may be able to more effectively personalize their relationships with customers  thereby gaining a competitive advantage 
although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company that offers our entire range of merchandise and services  within each category we have competitors and we may face competition from new entrants 
some of our competitors or our potential competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and greater brand recognition 
in addition  larger  well established and well financed entities may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors 
increased competition from these or other competitors could negatively impact our business 
changing consumer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business we target consumers who assign high value to personal development  healthy lifestyles  responsible media  and the environment 
a decrease of consumer interest in purchasing goods and services that promote the values we espouse would materially and adversely affect our customer base and sales revenues and  accordingly  our financial prospects 
further  consumer preferences and product trends are difficult to predict 
our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes 
failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends could lead to  among other things  lower sales of our products  increased merchandise returns and lower margins  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our strategy of offering branded products could lead to inventory risk and higher costs an important part of our strategy is to feature branded products 
these products are sold under our brand names and are manufactured to our specifications 
we expect our reliance on branded merchandise to increase 
the use of branded merchandise requires us to incur costs and risks relating to the design and purchase of products  including submitting orders earlier and making longer initial purchase commitments 
in addition  the use of branded merchandise limits our ability to return unsold products to vendors  which can result in higher markdowns in order to sell excess inventory 
our commitment to customer service typically results in our keeping a high level of merchandise in stock so we can fill orders quickly 
consequently  we run the risk of having excess inventory  which may also contribute to higher markdowns 
our failure to successfully execute a branded merchandise strategy or to achieve anticipated profit margins on these goods  or a higher than anticipated level of overstocks  may materially adversely affect our revenues 
we offer our customers liberal merchandise return policies 
our consolidated financial statements include a reserve for anticipated merchandise returns  which is based on historical return rates 
it is possible that actual returns may increase as a result of factors such as the introduction of new merchandise  changes in merchandise mix or other factors 
any increase in our merchandise returns will correspondingly reduce our revenues and profits 
acquisitions and new initiatives may harm our financial results we have historically expanded our operations in part through strategic acquisitions and through new initiatives that we generate 
we cannot accurately predict the timing  size and success of these efforts 
our acquisition and new initiative strategies involve significant risks that could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results  including the following our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new initiatives at acceptable prices  our ability to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify or develop our new initiatives  our ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities  increases in asking prices by 
table of contents acquisition candidates to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria  diversion of management s attention to expansion efforts  unanticipated costs and contingent liabilities associated with acquisitions and new initiatives  failure of acquired businesses or new initiatives to achieve expected results  our failure to retain key customers or personnel of acquired businesses and difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience 
in addition  the size  timing and success of any future acquisitions and new initiatives may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year 
these fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the loss of the services of our key personnel could disrupt our business we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly jirka rysavy and lynn powers 
a loss of one or more of the members of our senior management or key personnel could severely and negatively impact our operations 
our strategy of allowing the management teams of some acquired companies to continue to exercise significant management responsibility for those companies makes it important that we retain key employees  particularly the sales and creative teams  of the companies we might acquire 
hiring qualified management is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals in the industry in which we operate 
failure to attract and retain personnel  particularly management personnel  would continue to materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations our founder and chairman jirka rysavy controls us mr 
rysavy holds of our  outstanding shares of class b common stock and also owns  shares of class a common stock 
the shares of class b common stock are convertible into shares of class a common stock at any time 
each share of class b common stock has ten votes per share  and each share of class a common stock has one vote per share 
consequently  mr 
rysavy holds approximately of our voting stock and  thus  is able to exert substantial influence over us and to control matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors  increasing our authorized capital stock  or a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets 
as a result of mr 
rysavy s control of us  no change of control can occur without mr 
rysavy s consent 
our success depends on the value of our brand because of our reliance on sales of proprietary products  our success depends on our brand 
building and maintaining recognition of our brand are important for attracting and expanding our customer base 
if the value of our brand were adversely affected  we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new customers  retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases  and if the value of our brand were to diminish  our revenues  results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 
our present indebtedness and potential future borrowings could adversely affect our financial health  future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations  and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing 
we have a revolving line of credit with outstanding borrowings and various letters of credit 
there can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our long term debt service obligations 
our present indebtedness and potential future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us  such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing without restructuring the covenants in our existing indebtedness to permit the incurrence of such financing  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be used for payments on the debt and related interest  thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements  causing us to incur higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates on our borrowings that have variable interest rates or in the event of refinancing existing debt at higher interest rates  limiting our ability to make asset or business investments  dispose of assets  pay cash dividends or repurchase stock  placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt or greater resources  and subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  the non compliance with which could result in an event of default 
disputes concerning media content and intellectual property may adversely affect us most of our media content is subject to arrangements with third parties pursuant to which we have licensed certain rights to use and distribute media content owned by third parties or have licensed to third parties certain rights to use and distribute media content that we own 
in addition  we have a number of agreements with third parties concerning the use of our media content and intellectual property  including agreements regarding royalties  distribution  duplication  etc 
allegations that our rights to use media content are incomplete or other disputes arising from such arrangements may be costly and may have a material adverse impact on our results 

table of contents product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages as a seller of consumer products  we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our products results in injuries 
if such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur  we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity 
the successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and  if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims  could require us to make significant payments from our own resources 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for the success of our proprietary products we are dependent on the success of our proprietary products  and we rely on a select group of manufacturers to provide us with sufficient quantities to meet our customers demands in a timely manner  produce these products in a humane and safe environment for both their workers and the planet  maintain quality standards consistent with our brand  and meet certain pricing guarantees 
our overseas sourcing arrangements carry risks associated with products manufactured outside of the us  including political unrest and trade restrictions  currency fluctuations  transportation difficulties  work stoppages  and other uncertainties 
in addition  a number of our suppliers are small companies  and some of these vendors may not have sufficient capital  resources or personnel to maintain or increase their sales to us or to meet our needs for commitments from them 
the failure of our suppliers to provide sufficient quantities of our proprietary products could decrease our revenues  increase our costs  and damage our customer service reputation 
we rely on communications and shipping networks to deliver our products given our emphasis on customer service  the efficient and uninterrupted operation of order processing and fulfillment functions is critical to our business 
to maintain a high level of customer service  we rely heavily on a number of different outside service providers  such as printers  telecommunications companies and delivery companies 
any interruption in services from our principal outside service providers  including delays or disruptions resulting from labor disputes  power outages  human error  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  could materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  freight carriers must ship products that we source overseas to our distribution center  and a work stoppage or political unrest could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customer orders 
information systems upgrades or integrations may disrupt our operations or financial reporting we continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems  which are critical to our business 
these systems assist in processing orders  managing inventory  purchasing and shipping merchandise on a timely basis  responding to customer service inquiries  and gathering and analyzing operating data by business segment  customer  and stock keeping unit a specific identifier for each different product 
we are required to continually update these systems 
furthermore  if we acquire other companies  we will need to integrate the acquired companies systems with ours  a process that could be time consuming and costly 
if our systems cannot accommodate our growth or if they fail  we could incur substantial expenses and our business could be adversely affected 
additionally  success in ecommerce depends upon our ability to provide a compelling and satisfying shopping experience 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our online technology  and if we are unable to do this  our business could be adversely affected 
a material security breach could cause us to lose sales  damage our reputation or result in liability to us our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
we may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against a security breach or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the security measures that we use to protect personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective 
we currently rely on security and authentication technology that we license from third parties 
we may not succeed in preventing all security breaches and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
our systems may fail or limit user traffic  which would cause us to lose sales we support a portion of our business through our call center in louisville  colorado 
even though we have back up arrangements  we are dependent on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in this center in effective working order and to protect against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
in addition  growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our computer and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems failure 
we have experienced capacity constraints and failure of information systems in the past that have resulted in decreased levels of service delivery or interruptions in service to customers for limited periods of time 
although we continually review and consider upgrades to our technical infrastructure and provide for system redundancies and backup power to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure  substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely affect our business 
additionally  if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our infrastructure  including our call center  our ability to grow may be constrained 

table of contents government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws  as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce 
such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  user privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  consumer protection  the provision of online payment services and quality of products and services 
many of the fundamental statutes and regulations applicable to our business were established before the adoption and growth of the internet and ecommerce 
there is lack of clarity on how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce 
unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business 
specifically  the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax  value added tax vat  goods and services tax  business tax and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses such as ours and our customers is a complex and evolving issue 
in many cases  it is not clear how existing tax laws and regulations apply to the internet and ecommerce 
in addition  governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues  which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues  including through indirect taxes 
we generally collect sales taxes only on sales to residents of states in which we have nexus 
currently  we collect sales taxes on certain sales to residents of colorado  illinois  new york  ohio  and texas 
a number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal  state and local level  and by foreign governments  that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet and certain states and other jurisdictions have taken measures to tax internet related activities 
if legislation is enacted that requires us to collect taxes on sales to residents of other states or jurisdictions  sales in our direct to consumer businesses may be adversely affected 
further  a successful assertion by one or more states or other jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities  including for past sales  as well as penalties and interest 
we may face legal liability for the content contained on our websites we could face legal liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement  personal injury or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute on our websites 
if we are held liable for damages for the content on our websites  our business may suffer 
further  one of our goals is for our websites to be trustworthy and dependable providers of information and services 
allegations of impropriety  even if unfounded  could therefore have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business 
we may be subject to litigation which  if adversely determined  could cause us to incur substantial losses 
from time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses  we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes 
some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies  or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage 
as a result  we might also be required to incur significant legal fees  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
in addition  because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action  it is possible that  as a result of current and or future litigation  we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses 
relying on our centralized fulfillment center could expose us to losing revenue prompt and efficient fulfillment of our customers orders is critical to our business 
our facility in cincinnati  ohio handles our fulfillment functions and some customer service related operations  such as returns processing 
many of our orders are filled and shipped from the cincinnati facility 
the balance is shipped by third party fulfillment centers or directly from suppliers 
because we rely on a centralized fulfillment center  our fulfillment functions could be severely impaired in the event of fire  extended adverse weather conditions  transportation difficulties or natural disasters 
because we recognize revenue only when we ship orders  interruption of our shipping could diminish our revenues 
we may face quarterly and seasonal fluctuations that could harm our business our revenue and results of operations have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of catalog offerings  timing of orders from retailers  recognition of costs or net sales contributed by new merchandise  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in paper  production and postage costs and expenses  merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in our merchandise mix 
in particular  our net sales and profits have historically been higher during the fourth quarter holiday season 
we believe that this seasonality will continue in the future 
postage and shipping costs may increase and therefore increase our expenses we ship our products  catalogs  and lifestyle publications to consumers and the cost of shipping is a material expenditure 
postage and shipping prices increase periodically and can be expected to increase in the future 
any inability to secure suitable or commercially favorable prices or other terms for the delivery of our merchandise and catalogs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change  which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the nasdaq  periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws 
as interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues  we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses

overview and outlook we are a lifestyle media and products company providing a broad selection of information  media  products and services to customers who value yoga  fitness  wellness  personal development  and responsible media 
we offer our customers the ability to consume content and utilize merchandise based on these values while providing quality offerings at a price comparable to other alternatives 
we market our content  media and products through a multi channel approach including digital media channels  direct to consumers via catalogs  the internet  direct response television  broadband  and subscriptions  as well as traditional retail stores 
at the end of  not counting digital channels  our products were carried by over  retail stores in the united states alone  and we had over million direct customers 
our brand is built around our ability to develop and offer media content  products  and lifestyle solutions to consumers in the lohas market 
we market our media and products through a multi channel approach including traditional media channels  direct to consumers via ecommerce  direct response marketing  subscriptions  digital streaming through gaiam tv and catalogs  and through national retailers  digital partners and corporate accounts 
our content forms the basis of our proprietary offerings  which then drive demand for parallel product and service offerings 
our operations are vertically integrated from content creation  through product development and sourcing  to customer service and distribution 
we market our products and services across two segments business and direct to consumer 
we distribute the majority of our products from our fulfillment center or drop ship products directly to customers 
we also utilize a third party replication and fulfillment center for media distribution in our business segment 
our business segment sells directly to retailers and digital partners  with our products available in over  retail doors in the united states 
at the end of  our branded store within store presentations were in over  locations worldwide 
during the third quarter of  our business segment expanded the gaiam brand with the strategic store within store placement of it in all sports authority stores and with the spri brand in sears stores 
in  we launched a media category management role that is part of our long term strategy and a key step in securing shelf space for media 
we have now expanded this strategy to over  retail doors 
through its diverse media reach  the direct to consumer segment provides an opportunity to launch and support new media releases  a sounding board for new product testing  promotional opportunities  a growing subscription base  and customer feedback on gaiam and the lohas industry s focus and future 
was a pivotal year for gaiam 
we improved our financial results considerably at the same time as we invested in our future digital strategy and new digital subscription business 
our internal sales grew by and our overall net revenue increased 
we generated adjusted ebitda of million and non gaap net income improved to million during compared to break even adjusted ebitda and a loss of million during refer to the non gaap financial measures tables below 
our cash flow from operations grew to million during these results were achieved despite a nearly million operating loss in our digital subscription businesses as we invested heavily in the development and launch out of beta of gaiam tv  which is a key long term digital media delivery strategy 
these successes and investment strategies position us well for the many years to come 
during  the improvement in our business segment was driven by internal revenue growth of approximately that resulted from strong sales at our current retail partners  including target fitness and target media aggregator  as well as the addition of the new retail partnerships as mentioned above in the latter half of the year 
the acquisition of media distributor gaiam vivendi entertainment at the end of march added million in revenue and margin and afforded gaiam a direct relationship with all major digital retailers that we will leverage across all our media titles 
this segment also benefited from two new branded product lines gaiam restore  our at home rehabilitative and restorative accessories  and gaiam sol  our premium yoga line  both of which we launched during the fourth quarter of also during  this segment launched a major as seen on tv fitness media product featuring the biggest loser star  jillian michaels  and other as seen on tv titles  including the firm express 
due to our compliment of branded and private label products and our number one ranking on nielsen s videoscan for fitness media  we have achieved category management and media aggregator roles and effectively manage the yoga and fitness offerings at some of the largest retailers in the nation 
in addition to our fitness accessory business  our business segment also distributes entertainment media titles owned by third party studios and ourselves 
we provide full distribution services including marketing  logistics  and sales to physical and online digital retailers 
with the acquisition of gaiam vivendi entertainment in march  gaiam s entertainment media business has grown to 
table of contents become the third largest non theatrical content distributor in the united states  behind only warner and disney  with rights to over  titles 
by combining the distribution operations of both companies  we have begun to realize synergies  including reduced operational costs and improved selling opportunities 
overall  we believe the financial benefits of this acquisition strengthen our position as a leading branded lifestyle media company with extensive retailer  direct to consumer  and online sales channels 
during the third quarter  we incurred certain redundant operational costs as we integrated the recently acquired gaiam vivendi entertainment business 
in the following months  we will be focused on finalizing the integration of vivendi and pursuing additional growth through addition of new distribution and licensing contracts  such as what we have already done with hallmark channel and the jim henson company  as well as expansion of sales to digital video providers 
during most of  in our direct to consumer segment we strategically reduced media spend and  thus  optimized profitability rather than trying to drive revenue in our direct response television marketing business during the olympic games and political campaign season 
also  we plan to continue the repositioning of our ecommerce and catalog product offerings towards more apparel and fitness 
in october  we successfully transitioned our ecommerce business to a new more flexible and dynamic platform 
we are also continuing to invest in and market our digital platform  gaiam tv 
com  which will allow us to further leverage our existing subscriber base and catalog and internet consumer relationships to grow our digital sales through the delivery of primarily exclusive media content 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on our financial presentation  and involve a higher degree of complexity  as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired  additional allowances could be required 
we record allowances for product returns to be received in future periods at the time we recognize the original sale 
we base the amounts of the returns allowances upon historical experience and future expectations 
inventory inventory consists primarily of finished goods held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition 
we write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition 
our other intangibles mainly consist of customer and marketing related assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise on a reporting unit level 
we have the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if it is determined that the fair value for a reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount for that reporting unit  then the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if it is determined that the two step impairment test is necessary  then for step one  we compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  we consider the goodwill of the reporting unit not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss 
we use either a comparable market approach or a traditional present value method to test for potential impairment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results 

table of contents investments we account for investments in limited liability companies in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence or control  or in which we hold a five percent or more membership interest  under the equity method 
we account for investments in corporations in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence or control  or in which we hold a twenty percent or more ownership  under the equity method 
under the equity method  we record our share of the income or losses of the investment by increasing or decreasing the carrying value of our investment and recording the income or expense through the consolidated statement of operations 
under the cost method of accounting  we carry investments in private companies at cost and adjust them only for other than temporary declines in fair value 
determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence or control over a company is highly subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
purchase accounting we account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the acquisition method 
in determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities  we make assumptions based upon many different factors  such as historical and other relevant information and analyses performed by independent parties 
assumptions may be incomplete  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions  estimates  or actual results 
media library our media library asset represents the fair value of the library of produced videos acquired through business combinations  the purchase price of media rights to both video and audio titles  and the capitalized cost to produce media products  all of which we market to retailers and to direct mail and online customers 
we amortize the fair value of acquired or purchased media titles and content on a straight line basis over succeeding periods on the basis of their estimated useful lives 
we defer capitalized production costs for financial reporting purposes until the media is released  and then amortize these costs over succeeding periods on the basis of estimated sales 
historical sales statistics are the principal factor used in estimating the amortization rate 
revenue presently  revenue primarily consists of sales of products  media licensing  and media distribution 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products and the licensing of media when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize distribution fees from our gaiam vivendi entertainment business and certain other media distribution arrangements on a net revenue basis 
for these media distribution sales  we do not take title to the related product sold as the inventory is owned by the studio or content producers and sold by us under distribution agent agreements 
we recognize amounts billed to customers for postage and handling as revenue at the same time we recognize the revenue arising from the product sale 
we present revenue net of taxes collected from customers 
prior to  we also recognized revenue from real goods solar s energy integration fixed price contracts 
for energy system installations of less than kilowatts  we recognized revenue when the installation was substantially complete  determined based on departure from the job site following completion of the installation or passing of building inspection  while for energy system installations equal to or greater than kilowatts  we recognized revenue on a percentage of completion basis  with the extent of progress towards completion measured by the cost to cost method 
share based compensation we measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value 
in estimating this fair value  there are certain assumptions that we use  as disclosed in note share based compensation  consisting of the expected life of the option  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and volatility 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense

these capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our product offerings  our ability to expand our customer base  the cost of ongoing upgrades to our product offerings  the level of expenditures for sales and marketing  the level of investment in distribution systems and facilities and other factors 
the timing and amount of these capital requirements are variable and we cannot accurately predict them

assuming an average sale price  net of broker fees  of per share  the sale of all  shares could raise cash of million 
in the normal course of our business  we investigate  evaluate and discuss acquisition  joint venture  minority investment  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in our market 
for any future investment  acquisition or joint venture opportunities  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
while there can be no assurances  we believe our cash on hand  cash expected to be generated from operations  cash that could be raised by the sale of our shelf registration stock and or equity investment of  shares of real goods solar s class a common stock  available carried forward tax net operating losses  and borrowing capabilities should be sufficient to fund our operations on both a short term and long term basis

table of contents contractual obligations we have commitments pursuant to operating lease and media distribution agreements 
the following table shows our commitments to make future payments or advances under these agreements as of december  in thousands total years operating lease payments media distribution advances total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes  but do have on occasion forward contracts for or investments in foreign currency  the gains and losses from which have been immaterial 
in  we acquired controlling financial interest in and  therefore  consolidated gaiam pty  an australian based joint venture 
since gaiam pty s functional currency is the australian dollar  this subsidiary exposes us to risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
however  we have determined that no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results from operations or cash flows existed as of december  we have a revolving line of credit with outstanding borrowings and various letters of credit 
accordingly  any unfavorable change in interest rates could have a material impact on our results from operations or cash flows 
as of december   if either of our credit agreement s eurodollar  libor  pnc s stated commercial  or federal funds open rates were to increase by one percentage point  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million  assuming constant debt levels 
we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are primarily us dollar denominated transactions 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies has and may continue to lead to increased purchasing costs
