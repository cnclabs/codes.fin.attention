the investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of apm and apm operating results were included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition 
upon the completion of the apm acquisition in fiscal year  we performed a review and assessment of the useful lives of certain of our property and equipment 
as a result of our review  we revised the estimated useful life of the related manufacturing machinery and equipment from years to years beginning december  on a prospective basis 
the effect of this accounting change was to decrease depreciation expense related to cost of goods sold by million  increase net income by approximately million  net of a tax effect of million  and increase basic net income per share by approximately and increase diluted net income per share by approximately for fiscal year conversion from ifrs to us gaap we formerly prepared our consolidated financial statements under ifrs and filed our ifrs financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  in our annual report on form f 
pursuant to sec requirements  we assessed our ownership structure as of december  and determined that we no longer qualified as a foreign private issuer under applicable sec rules 
as a result  beginning july   we were required to report our consolidated financial statements under us gaap and file our annual report on form k  as well as to comply with additional sec reporting obligations as a domestic issuer 
accordingly  we have converted our consolidated financial statements under ifrs to us gaap 
a summary of significant relevant differences of individual items in the financial statements between ifrs and us gaap and their impact to the above historical consolidated financial data is outlined below inventory reserves we record inventories at the lower of cost or market under both us gaap and ifrs 
under us gaap  a write down of inventory to the lower of cost or market creates a new cost basis that subsequently cannot be reversed based on changes in circumstances 
under ifrs  when circumstances that previously caused the inventory write down no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realizable value  the amount of the write down is reversed even though the associated inventories have not been sold 
the impact to the statement of income loss due to the difference between us gaap and ifrs was to increase inventory reserves for the fiscal years ended june  and by  and  respectively 
share based compensation expense under us gaap  prior to july   we accounted for options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic value method  deferred compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant if the fair value of the underlying share exceeds the exercise price  and expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grant  generally five years 
effective on july   we adopted asc topic formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment using the prospective transition method to account for options granted to employees 
under the prospective method  new awards or awards modified  repurchased  or canceled after the effective date are accounted for under the provision of asc topic  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values of the awards 
we amortize the fair value of options or equity awards using the graded vesting attribution method over the respective vesting period which is generally over five years 
under ifrs  we accounted for share based compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards effective on january  the fair value of options or equity awards is amortized using the graded vesting attribution method over the respective vesting period which is generally over five years 
the increase decrease in share based compensation expense resulted from the accounting for the different transition dates between us gaap and ifrs and the application of apb for the fiscal years ended june  and was  and  respectively 
investment in apm we have made various investments in apm since apm inception in july prior to our acquisition of apm in december  the investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting under both ifrs and us gaap

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
overview we are a designer  developer and global supplier of a broad portfolio of power semiconductors 
our portfolio of power semiconductors includes over  products  and has grown rapidly with the introduction of over new products during the fiscal year  and over and new products in the fiscal years and  respectively 
our teams of scientists and engineers have developed extensive intellectual properties and technical knowledge that encompass major aspects of power semiconductors  which we believe enables us to introduce and develop innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced electronics 
we have an extensive patent portfolio that consists of patents and patent applications in the united states as of june  we differentiate ourselves by integrating our expertise in technology  design and advanced packaging to optimize product performance and cost 
our portfolio of products targets high volume applications  including personal computers  flat panel tvs  led lighting  smart phones  battery packs  consumer and industrial motor controls and power supplies for tvs  computers  servers and telecommunications equipment 
during the fiscal year ended june   we continued our diversification program by introducing new silicon and packaging platforms to expand our serviceable available market sam and offer higher performance products 
our metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors mosfet portfolio expanded significantly across a full range of voltage applications 
in response to the rapid decline of the personal computer pc markets  we have developed new technologies and products designed to penetrate into other markets  including the consumer  communications and industrial markets 
for example  for the power discrete products  since mid we have been shipping high volume of our gen series low voltage mosfet silicon platform introduced in the september quarter of during the december quarter of  we released the new high voltage alphamosii mosfet platform that features a reduction of on resistance when compared to prior generation products 
in the same quarter  we also released the xsfet technology platform to provide a high performance option to the current solutions targeting the advanced computing and high efficiency telecommunications and industrial applications 
in addition  we expanded our recently developed alphaigbt technology platform with low power and high power products that meet the growing demand for energy efficient switching devices for motor control and power conversion applications in household appliances  renewable energy systems and advanced power supplies 
we have also expanded our portfolio of medium voltage mosfets with new v  v and v products  thus enabling a full portfolio of products that allows significant improvements in power supply efficiency 
for the power ic products  we continue to expand the product family by introducing new solutions to led lighting and led back lighting for lcd tv 
we also released high efficiency ezbuck ii converters and our new drmos product family targeting ultrabook and advanced computing 
our business model leverages global resources  including research and development and manufacturing in the united states and asia 
our sales and technical support teams are localized in several growing markets 
we operate a mm wafer fabrication facility located in hillsboro  oregon  the oregon fab which is critical for us to accelerate proprietary technology development  new product introduction and improve our financial performance in the long run 
for example  in calendar year  we were able to triple the number of new technology platforms released as compared to prior years 
these platforms have allowed us to develop a new generation of low voltage mosfet products  our gen alphamos  and introduce alphamosii high voltage technology and new medium voltage products 
to meet the market demand for the more mature high volume products  we also utilize the wafer manufacturing capacity of selected third party foundries 
for assembly and test  we primarily rely upon our in house facilities in china 
in addition  we utilize subcontracting partners for industry standard packages 
we believe our in house packaging and testing capability provides us with a competitive advantage in proprietary packaging technology  product quality  cost and cycle time 
our revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   which represented a decrease of million or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  our net loss was million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to a net income of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  factors affecting our performance our performance is affected by several key factors  including the following the global  regional economic and pc market conditions because our products primarily serve consumer electronic applications  a deterioration of the global and regional economic conditions could materially affect our revenue and results of operations 
in particular  because a significant amount of our revenue is derived from sales of products in the personal computer pc markets  such as notebooks  motherboards and notebook battery packs  a significant decline or downturn in the pc markets can have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
our revenue from the pc markets accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended june   and  respectively 
a decline in the pc markets  due to continued growth of demands in tablets and smartphones  worldwide economic conditions and or industry inventory correction  have had a material negative impact on the demand for our products  revenue  factory utilization  gross margin  our ability to resell excess inventory  and other performance measures during the fiscal year 
in response to this trend  we have been executing and are continuing to execute strategies to diversify our product portfolio and penetrate into other market segments  such as the consumer  communication and industrial market segments  which we believe would mitigate and eventually overcome the reduced demand resulting from the declining pc markets 
as we develop and sell new products that serve more diversified markets  we expect that sales based on the pc markets  as a percentage of the total revenue  will continue to decline 
however  if the rate of decline in the pc markets is faster than we expected  or if we cannot successfully diversify or introduce new products to keep pace with the declining pc markets  we may not be able to alleviate its negative impact  which will adversely affect our results of operations 
in light of the continuing decline of the pc markets  we conducted an impairment review of certain of our long lived assets during the third quarter of fiscal year based on such review  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million as the changed circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of certain long lived assets for the quarter ended march   consisting of manufacturing machinery and equipment for the packaging of pc related product  may not be recoverable see impairment of long lived assets below for more details 
in addition  we have also recorded a non cash  non recurring inventory valuation charge in the amount of million for certain excess and obsolete inventory for the quarter ended march   consisting of products relating to pc applications  and to a lesser extent  products for power supplies 
we determined that this non recurring inventory write down was required primarily due to loss of market share with certain customers  including a major oem with whom we conducted business indirectly  as well as the effect of the continuing decline of the pc market 
although we have fully resolved the issue and maintain the business relationship with the oem and we believe our current provisions related to inventories and long lived assets are considered adequate  there is no assurance that we will not incur additional inventory write downs or impairment charges given the rapid and unpredictable changes of computing and consumer markets in which we compete 
such charges could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
erosion of average selling price erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical in our industry 
consistent with this historical trend  we expect that average selling prices of our existing products will continue to decline in the future 
however  as a normal course of business  we seek to offset the effect of declining average selling prices by introducing new and higher value products  expanding existing products for new applications and new customers  and reducing manufacturing cost of existing products 
product introductions and customers product requirements our success depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis that meet or are compatible with our customers specifications and performance requirements 
both factors  timeliness of product introductions and conformance to customers requirements  are equally important in securing design wins with our customers 
recently we have introduced new mid and high voltage products as part of our business strategy to diversify our product portfolios and penetrate into new markets such as the telecommunications and industrial markets 
as we accelerate the development of new technology platforms  we expect to increase the pace at which we introduce new products and obtain design wins 
our failure to introduce products on a timely basis that meet customers specifications and performance requirements and our inability to continue to expand our serviceable markets could adversely affect our financial performance  including loss of market shares with customers 
as discussed above  we recorded a non cash  non recurring inventory valuation charge in the amount of million during the third quarter of fiscal  and approximately million of which was attributable to newly developed products for desktop pc applications for a major oem because these products were not compatible with its particular applications 
we have been working closely with the oem to address these issues and implement solutions to prevent future occurrences of incompatibility 
while we have fully resolved this issue with the oem  similar product compatibility issues may arise with other products or oems  or that the solutions we implemented may not be fully effective in preventing future occurrences 
distributor ordering patterns and seasonality our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their forecasts of end customer demand  and this demand may vary significantly depending on the sales outlooks and market and economic conditions of end customers 
because these forecasts may not be accurate  channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly  which in turn may prompt distributors to make significant adjustments to their purchase orders placed with us 
as a result  our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
in addition  because our products are used in consumer electronics products  our revenue is subject to seasonality 
our sales seasonality is affected by numerous factors  including global and regional economic conditions as well as the pc market conditions  revenue generated from new products  changes in distributor ordering patterns in response to channel inventory adjustments and end customer demand for our products and fluctuations in consumer purchase patterns prior to major holiday seasons 
in recent periods  broad fluctuations in the semiconductor markets and the global and regional economic conditions  in particular the decline of the pc market conditions  have had a more significant impact on our results of operations than seasonality 
manufacturing costs our gross margin may be affected by our manufacturing costs  including utilization of our own manufacturing facilities  pricing of wafers from other foundries and semiconductor raw materials  which may fluctuate from time to time largely due to the market demand and supply 
capacity utilization affects our gross margin because we have certain fixed costs associated with our in house packaging and testing facilities and our oregon fab 
if we are unable to utilize the capacity of our in house manufacturing facilities at a desired level  our gross margin may be adversely affected 
in addition  the continuing decline of the pc markets as discussed above has led to reduced level of capacity utilization at our manufacturing facilities during the fiscal year if we are not able to mitigate the negative impact of the declining pc markets  we may not be able to improve our factory utilization or offset the increasing manufacturing costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin 
for example  the gross margin for the first quarter of the fiscal year was  primarily as a result of higher utilization of our manufacturing facilities  while the adjusted gross margin for the last three quarters of the fiscal year  without giving effect to the million non recurring inventory write down recorded in the third quarter of the fiscal year  was 
this decrease was largely due to the reduced level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities during that period 
the adjusted gross margin used here is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this information is meaningful to investors as it excludes the impact that the non recurring inventory write down has on gross margin and facilitates comparisons between reporting periods and peer companies 
while we believe that the adjusted gross margin is useful supplemental information  such adjusted measure is not intended to replace our gaap financial measures and should be read in conjunction with the gaap results 
the gaap gross margin for the last three quarters of the fiscal year was 
other factors that may affect comparability apm acquisition we held a equity interest in agape package manufacturing ltd 
apm  at june  we made an additional equity investment of million in apm in october resulting in a equity interest in apm 
the investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting through the date of acquisition 
on december   we acquired apm and apm operating results were reflected in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to that date 
change in accounting estimate during fiscal year  upon the completion of apm acquisition  we performed a review and assessment of the useful lives of certain of our property and equipment 
based on the results of our review  we revised the estimated useful life of the related manufacturing and facility equipment from years to years beginning december  on a prospective basis 
the effect of this change was to decrease depreciation expense related to cost of goods sold by million  increase net income by approximately million  net of a tax effect of million  increase basic net income per share by approximately and increase diluted net income per share by approximately for fiscal year conversion of ifrs to us gaap 
we formerly prepared our consolidated financial statements under ifrs and filed our ifrs financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  in our annual report on form f 
pursuant to the sec requirements  we assessed our ownership structure as of december  and determined that we no longer qualified as a foreign private issuer 
as a result  started on july   we were required to report our financial statements under us gaap and file our annual report on form k  as well as to comply with additional sec reporting obligations as a domestic issuer 
accordingly  we have converted our consolidated financial statements from ifrs to us gaap 
see item selected financial data for a discussion of relevant differences of individual items in the financial statements between ifrs and us gaap 
principal line items of statements of income the following describes the principal line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations revenue we generate revenue primarily from the sale of power semiconductors  consisting of power discretes and power ics 
historically  a majority of our revenue was derived from power discrete products and a smaller amount was derived from power ic products 
because our products typically have three year to five year life cycles  the rate of new product introduction is an important driver of revenue growth over time 
we believe that expanding the breadth of our product portfolio is important to our business prospects  because it provides us with an opportunity to increase our total bill of materials within an electronic system and to address the power requirements of additional electronic systems 
in addition  a small percentage of our total revenue is generated by providing packaging and testing services to third parties through one of our subsidiaries 
our product revenue includes the effect of the estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that we expect to provide to our distributors 
stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of products purchased by the distributor during a specified period 
at our discretion or upon our direct negotiations with the original design manufacturers odms or original equipment manufacturers oems  we may elect to grant special pricing that is below the prices at which we sold our products to the distributors 
in these situations  we will grant price adjustments to the distributors reflecting such special pricing 
we estimate the price adjustments for inventory at the distributors based on factors such as distributor inventory levels  pre approved future distributor selling prices  distributor margins and demand for our products 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs associated with semiconductor wafers  packaging and testing  personnel  including share based compensation expense  overhead attributable to manufacturing  operations and procurement  and cost associated with yield improvements  capacity utilization  warranty and inventory reserves 
as the volume of sales increases  we expect cost of goods sold to increase 
we have recently implemented a process to improve our factory capacity utilization rates by transferring more wafer production to our oregon fab and reducing our reliance on outside foundries 
while our utilization rates cannot be immune to the market conditions  our goal is to make them less vulnerable to market fluctuations 
we believe our market diversification strategy and product growth will drive higher volume of manufacturing which will improve our factory utilization rates and gross margin in the long run 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and impairment of long lived assets 
we expect that our total operating expenses will generally increase over time due to our belief that our business will continue to grow 
however  our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits  share based compensation expense  expenses associated with new product prototypes  travel expenses  fees for engineering services provided by outside contractors and consultants  amortization of software and design tools  depreciation of equipment and overhead costs for research and development personnel 
as we continue to invest significant resources in developing new technologies and products  we expect our research and development expenses to increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits  share based compensation expense  product promotion costs  occupancy costs  travel expenses  expenses related to sales and marketing activities  amortization of software  depreciation of equipment  maintenance costs and other expenses for general and administrative functions as well as costs for outside professional services  including legal  audit and accounting services 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our business 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets or asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset or asset group is assessed by determining if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life 
the impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value 
income on equity investment in apm we had a equity interest in apm as of september  in october   we made an additional equity investment of million in apm which resulted in aggregate a equity interest in apm prior to the apm acquisition on december  our investment in apm was accounted for under the equity method of accounting prior to december and we recorded income on equity investment in apm prior to the apm acquisition 
apm operating results were consolidated in our financial statements since the acquisition 
income tax expense we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions 
significant judgment and estimates are required in determining our worldwide income tax expense 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations of different jurisdictions globally 
we establish accruals for potential liabilities and contingencies based on a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of uncertain tax positions 
if the recognition threshold is met  the applicable accounting guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
if the actual tax outcome of such exposures is different from the amounts that were initially recorded  the differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made 
changes in the location of taxable income loss could result in significant changes in our income tax expense 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on historical profitability and our estimate of future taxable income in a particular jurisdiction 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  tax planning strategies or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the deferred tax assets may increase or decrease  resulting in corresponding changes in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide profits or losses  the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region where we have operations  the availability of tax credits and carry forwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
operating results the following tables set forth our results of operations and as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and our historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

the decrease in sales of power discrete and power ic products was mainly a result of a decrease in average selling price partially offset by a increase in unit shipments as compared to last year 
the decrease in average selling price was mainly due to a shift in product mix  the reduced demand for our products related to pc applications  and to a lesser extent  selling price erosion in the computing and consumer markets 
the decrease in revenue of packaging and testing services as compared to last year was primarily due to reduced demand 
in response to the declining pc markets  we have been executing and are continuing to execute strategies to diversify our product portfolio and penetrate into other market segments  which we believe would mitigate and eventually overcome the reduced demand resulting from the declining pc markets 
during fiscal year  we accelerated the development of new technology platforms which has allowed us to introduce medium and high voltage mosfet products  targeting the consumer  communication and industrial markets  as well as low voltage mosfet products for the computing market 
fiscal vs total revenue was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or as compared to million for fiscal year the decrease consisted of million and million decrease in sales of power discrete and power ic products  respectively  partially offset by million increase in packaging and testing services revenue due to full year service revenue recognition for fiscal year as compared to only seven months service revenue recognition for fiscal year after the acquisition of apm in december the decrease in sales of power discrete and power ic products was primarily due to the semiconductor industry downturn in the first half of fiscal year which resulted in a decline in average selling prices 
in response to the softened demand  we introduced more than new products during the year as well as further expanded our high and medium voltage product portfolio to successfully gain market share in certain areas  which resulted in a increase in unit shipments during the year 
during fiscal year  we introduced medium and high voltage mosfet products  targeting the communication and industrial markets  as well as low voltage mosfet products for the computing market 
cost of goods sold and gross profit year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage cost of goods sold percentage of revenue gross profit percentage of revenue fiscal vs cost of goods sold was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of a million non recurring inventory write down and increased unit shipments 
the non recurring inventory write down was for certain excess and obsolete inventory consisting of newly developed products for desktop pc applications primarily for a major oem that were not compatible with its particular applications  and to a lesser extent  products for power supplies 
gross margin decreased by percentage points to for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the non recurring inventory write down of million  as well as reduced average selling price  partially offset by tighter factory expense control as compared to last year 
we expect our gross margin to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of variations in our product mix  factory utilization  semiconductor wafer and raw material pricing  manufacturing labor cost and general economic and pc market conditions 
fiscal vs cost of goods sold was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for fiscal year gross margin decreased by percentage points to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to selling price erosion  lower factory utilization and higher period costs related to the ramp up of our oregon fab facility acquired in january  partially offset by the benefits gained from our new products introduction and costs savings from material purchases during the year 
we expect our gross margin to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of variations in our product mix  factory utilization  semiconductor wafer and raw material pricing  manufacturing labor cost and general economic conditions 
if we are unable to utilize the capacity of our in house manufacturing facilities at a desirable level  our gross margin may be adversely affected 
during the initial ramp up period of our oregon fab acquired in january  our gross margin for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year was adversely affected by approximately to 
research and development expenses year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage research and development fiscal vs research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in product prototyping engineering expenses  mainly related to engineering wafers expenses incurred during fiscal year under the then foundry agreement with idt prior to the acquisition of the oregon fab 
the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to increase in headcount related to the oregon fab acquired in january we continue to invest significant resources in developing new technologies and new products utilizing our own fabrication and packaging facilities 
however  we expect that our research and development expenses will fluctuate from time to time 
fiscal vs research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in product prototyping and engineering expenses related to qualifying the oregon fab and introduction of new products during fiscal year as compared to new products of prior year  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to the newly acquired fixed assets during the year  partially offset by a million decrease in personnel expenses primarily related to lower bonuses which varied with our business performance 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage selling  general and administrative fiscal vs selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in share based compensation due to increased cancellations of stock options and other equity awards  a million decrease in accounting  sarbanes oxley compliance and consulting fees due to the decrease in related accounting and consulting activities  a million decrease in business taxes primarily due to a business tax refund of a subsidiary in china during fiscal year  a million decrease in sales commission primarily due to decrease in sales and a million bad debt expenses incurred related to a service customer during fiscal year  and these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in employee compensation  benefits and business expenses mainly due to increase in headcount  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily due to fixed assets acquired during fiscal year and a million increase in legal expenses due to increased legal consulting services 
fiscal vs selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or from million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in audit  accounting  legal and consulting fees related to special projects  including the us gaap conversion and the apm acquisition during the prior year  a million decrease in personnel expenses primarily related to bonuses which varied with business performance  a million decrease in commission expenses due to lower sales volume  a million decrease in business tax primarily due to a tax refund of a subsidiary in china  a million increase in tax concession and refund of tax handling fees of certain subsidiaries in china and a million decrease in share based compensation primarily due to less stock options granted in fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in allowance for doubtful accounts primarily related to a service customer  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily related to fixed assets acquired during the period and intangible assets acquired during the apm acquisition in december impairment of long lived assets during the third quarter of fiscal year  in light of the unfavorable market conditions particularly related to the accelerated decline of the pc market  we conducted an in depth analysis of our strategic plan 
in our review  we reconsidered the key assumptions in our overall strategic business and manufacturing capacity plans in light of the continued declines in the pc market 
as a result  we revised our pc related revenue and volume outlook as well as our manufacturing capacity requirements 
these material changes in our outlook and plans  which we were able to determine in the third quarter of fiscal  triggered an impairment review of our long lived assets 
we determined that the related estimated undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of certain manufacturing machinery and equipment primarily for the packaging of our pc related products due to the accelerated decline of the pc markets 
the average remaining useful life of those impaired assets was approximately two years 
we estimated the fair values of those long lived assets based on net realizable values of similar machinery and equipment recently transacted by third party used machine brokers and recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million to reduce the related carrying amount to its estimated fair value as of march  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we evaluated our amortizable intangible assets for impairment and determined that the related estimated undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the intangible assets and no impairment charge was recorded 
during the same period  we also evaluated our goodwill for impairment and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit  estimated based on the market capitalization approach  was more than its carrying value and no impairment charge was recorded 
we re evaluated our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill for impairment as part of our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
interest income and expenses fiscal vs interest income was primarily related to interest earned from cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in interest income for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower average interest rate 
interest expense was primarily related to bank borrowings 
the increase in interest expenses for fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in bank borrowings  including the million term loan obtained in may for working capital of our oregon fab as compared to fiscal year fiscal vs the decrease in interest income for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in average cash and cash equivalents balances 
the increase in interest expenses during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in bank borrowings including the million term loan obtained in may for working capital purposes as compared to fiscal income on equity investment in apm year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage income on equity investment in apm fiscal vs income from our equity investment in apm represented our share of apm net income before apm was acquired 
apm operating results were consolidated in our financial statements since the acquisition as our wholly owned subsidiary in december and therefore  it is no longer reflected in this line item for fiscal years and income tax expense year ended june  change in thousands in thousands in percentage in thousands in percentage income tax expense fiscal vs income tax expense for fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
income tax expense increased by million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to the changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the two fiscal years  which was partially offset by the tax benefits from the january reinstatement of the us federal r d credit retroactive to january  fiscal vs income tax expense for fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
income tax expense increased by million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to the changes in the geographic mix of earnings in fiscal as compared to fiscal  combined with the expiration of the us federal research credit on december  liquidity and capital resources our principal need for liquidity and capital resources is to maintain sufficient working capital to support our operations and to invest adequate capital expenditures to fuel the growth of our business 
currently  we primarily financed our operations and capital expenditures through funds generated from operations 
on may   we entered into a loan agreement with a financial institution that provides a term loan of million for general purposes and a million non revolving credit line for the purchase of equipment 
both the term loan and equipment credit line will be fully repayable in may the borrowings may be made in the form of either eurodollar loans or base rate loans 
eurodollar loans accrue interest based on an adjusted london interbank offer rate libor as defined in the agreement  plus a margin of to 
base rate loans accrue interest at the highest of a the lender prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus and c the eurodollar rate for a one month interest period plus  plus a margin of to 
the applicable margins for both eurodollar loans and base rate loans will vary from time to time in the foregoing ranges based on the cash and cash equivalent balances maintained by us and our subsidiaries with the lender 
in may  the equipment credit line expired 
as of july   the outstanding balance of the term loan and the equipment credit line was million and million  respectively 
the obligations under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all assets of two of our subsidiaries  including but not limited to  certain real property and related assets located at the oregon fab 
in addition  we and certain of our subsidiaries have agreed to guarantee full repayment and performance of the obligations under the loan agreement 
the loan agreement contains customary restrictive covenants and includes certain financial covenants that require us to maintain on a consolidated basis specified financial ratios including total liabilities to tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage and current assets to current liabilities 
as of june   we were in compliance with these covenants 
two of our subsidiaries in china had revolving lines of credit that allow each of the subsidiaries to draw down  from time to time  up to of the accounts receivable of such subsidiary  with an aggregated maximum amount of rmb million equivalent of million based on the currency exchange rate as of june  to finance the subsidiary working capital with a maximum of day repayment term 
the interest rate on each draw down varies and indexes to the published libor per annum 
these lines will expire in september as of july   there was no outstanding balance under these two revolving lines of credit 
during july  we entered into a loan agreement with the state of oregon for an amount of million 
the loan is required to be used for training new and re training existing employees of the oregon fab 
the loan bears a compound annual interest rate of and is to be repaid in april the state may forgive the loan and unpaid interest if certain conditions primarily relating to hiring targets are met 
as of july   the outstanding balance and accrued interest of the loan  included in short term debt  was million 
on october   our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program 
under this repurchase program we may  from time to time  repurchase shares from the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to supervision and oversight by the board 
as of june   we repurchased an aggregate of  shares from the open market for a total cost of million  at an average price of per share  since inception of the program 
shares repurchased are accounted for as treasury shares and the total cost of shares repurchased is recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
as at june   of the  repurchased shares   shares with a weighted average repurchase price of per share  were reissued at an average price of per share for option exercises and vested restricted stock units 
the chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of china 
regulations in china permit foreign owned entities to freely convert the renminbi into foreign currency for transactions that fall under the current account  which includes trade related receipts and payments  and interests 
accordingly  our chinese subsidiaries may use renminbi to purchase foreign exchange currency for settlement of such current account transactions without pre approval 
other transactions that involve conversion of renminbi into foreign currency are classified as capital account transactions 
examples of capital account transactions include repatriations of investments by or dividends to foreign owners 
pursuant to applicable regulations  foreign invested enterprises in china may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits  if any  determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations 
in calculating accumulated profits  foreign investment enterprises in china are required to allocate at least of their profits each year  if any  to fund the equity reserve account unless the reserve has reached of the registered capital of the enterprises 
capital account transactions require prior approval from china state administration of foreign exchange safe or its provincial branch to convert a remittance into a foreign currency  such as us dollars  and transmit the foreign currency outside of china 
as a result of this and other restrictions under prc laws and regulations  our china subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the parent 
as of june  and  such restricted portion amounted to approximately million and million  or and  of our total consolidated net assets  respectively 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including working capital and capital expenditures  for at least the next twelve months 
in the long term  we may require additional capital due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if our cash is insufficient to meet our needs  we may seek to raise capital through equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and may include operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot be certain that any financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
cash and cash equivalents as of june  and  we had million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and short term bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less 
of the million and million cash and cash equivalents  million and million  respectively  are deposited with financial institutions outside the united states

capital expenditures capital expenditures were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures primarily consisted of the purchases of property and equipment 
as we have been building the foundation for our wafer manufacturing and new technology development capability under the fab lite business model since the acquisition of the oregon fab in fiscal year  we will be focusing on new product development and factory utilization going forward 
capital expenditures for fiscal year consisted primarily of purchases of equipment for the oregon fab 
capital expenditures for fiscal year primarily consisted of purchases of packaging and testing equipment for our in house packaging facilities and purchases of equipment for the oregon fab 
prior to the acquisition of the oregon fab in january  we utilized third party foundries for wafer fabrication and our capital expenditures were primarily related to purchase of certain specialized equipment consigned to the third party foundries to support our production requirements 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the oregon fab for a purchase price of million cash plus certain assumed liabilities of million 
following the acquisition of the oregon fab  we used a combination of in house capacity and third party foundries to satisfy our wafer manufacturing requirements 
capital expenditures for fiscal years primarily consisted of purchases of packaging and testing equipment for our two in house packaging facilities and purchases of consigned equipment to a third party foundry 
we relied primarily on our in house capacities for packaging and testing our products and expect to continue to do so in the future 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of june  are as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands bank borrowings oregon state loan capital leases operating leases capital commitments with respect to property and equipment purchase commitments with respect to inventories and research and development total contractual obligations as of june   we had recorded liabilities of million for uncertain tax positions and million for potential interest and penalties  which are not included in the above table because we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of payments in individual years that would be made in connection with these uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates  judgments and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition  inventory reserves  warranty accrual  income taxes  share based compensation  variable interest entities and useful lives for property and equipment and for goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue when product is shipped to the customer  net of estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments to certain distributors 
we sell our products primarily to distributors  who in turn sell our products globally to various end customers 
our revenue is net of the effect of the estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that we expect to provide to certain distributors 
stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of the products purchased by distributors during a specified period 
we estimate provision for stock rotation returns based on historical returns and individual distributor agreements 
we also provide special pricing to certain distributors primarily based on volume  to encourage resale of our products 
we estimate the expected price adjustments at the time the revenue is recognized based on distributor inventory levels  pre approved future distributor selling prices  distributor margins and demand for our products 
if actual stock rotation returns or price adjustments differ from our estimates  adjustments may be recorded in the period when such actual information is known 
allowance for price adjustments is recorded against accounts receivable and provision for stock rotation is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the deferred revenue  net of the associated deferred cost of the inventory  is recorded as deferred margin on the consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from certain distributors is deferred until the distributor resells the products to end customers due to price protection adjustments and right of returns that cannot be reliably measured 
packaging and testing services revenue is recognized upon shipment of serviced products to the customer 
inventory reserves we carry inventories at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost primarily consists of semiconductor wafers  packaging and testing  personnel  including share based compensation expense  overhead attributable to manufacturing  operations and procurement  yield improvements  capacity utilization 
inventory reserves are made based on our periodic review of inventory quantities on hand as compared with our sales forecasts  historical usage  aging of inventories  production yield levels and current product selling prices 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those forecasted by us  additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and the products that have previously been written down are sold  our gross margin would be favorably impacted 
product warranty we provide a standard one year warranty for the products we sell 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  labor and material costs for replacing defective parts  related freight costs for failed parts and other quality assurance costs 
we monitor our product returns for warranty claims and maintain warranty reserve based on our historical experiences and anticipated warranty claims known at the time of estimation 
if actual warranty costs differ significantly from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual would be required and any such adjustments could be material 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business 
we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies based on estimates of whether additional taxes may be due 
while the final tax outcome of these matters may differ from the amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made 
as a result  significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we consider evidence such as our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
we intend to maintain a partial valuation allowance equal to the state research and development credit carryfowards until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
we have not provided for withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
as of june   the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries considered permanently reinvested is  the determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings is not practicable 
should we decide to remit this income to the bermuda parent company in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model  the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by changes in earnings or tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to reserves  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
share based compensation expense we recognize share based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the awards determined by the black scholes option valuation model  using the accelerated vesting attribution method 
share based compensation expense is significant to the consolidated financial statements and is calculated using our best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
we determined the weighted average valuation assumptions as follows expected term 
it is determined by using the historical data of industry peers as adjusted for expected changes in future exercise patterns 
forfeiture rate 
it is estimated based on the historical average period of time that the awards were outstanding and forfeited 
the estimate of forfeitures is adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from the prior estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and impact the amount of stock compensation expenses to be recognized in future periods  which could be material if actual results differ significantly from our estimates 
volatility 
it is estimated based on that of the publicly traded shares of industry peers over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock awards granted 
risk free interest rate 
it is based on the yields of us treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the awards granted 
dividend yield 
it is zero as the company has never declared or paid any dividends and currently has no intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
variable interest entities and investment in apm we evaluate all transactions and relationships with potential variable interest entities vies to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entities  and therefore are required to consolidate with vies 
our overall methodology for evaluating transactions and relationships under the vie requirements includes the following two steps determine whether the entity meets the criteria to qualify as a vie  and determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
in performing the first step  we consider the significant factors and judgments in making the determination as to whether an entity is a vie including the design of the entity  including the nature of its risks and the purpose for which the entity was created  to determine the variability that the entity was designed to create and distribute to its interest holders  the nature of our involvement with the entity  whether control of the entity may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting equity  whether there is sufficient equity investment at risk to finance the activities of the entity  and whether parties other than the equity holders have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns 
for each vie identified  we then perform the second step and evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie by considering the following significant factors and judgments whether our variable interest absorbs the majority of the vie expected losses  whether our variable interest receives the majority of the vie expected returns  and whether we have the ability to make decisions that significantly affect the vie results and activities 
based on our evaluation of the above factors and judgments  no vies were identified as of june  and prior to the apm acquisition on december   we had a equity interest in apm which had been identified as a vie  however  we were not the primary beneficiary and therefore not required to consolidate the financial statements of apm 
the equity interest in apm was accounted for using the equity method through the date of acquisition 
estimated useful lives for property  plant and equipment and intangible assets property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets 
patents and exclusive technology rights purchased from third parties are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years 
trade name and customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair values at the acquisition date and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of three years and four years  respectively 
prior to december   the apm acquisition date  certain of our manufacturing machinery and equipment were depreciated over a useful life of years 
upon the completion of the apm acquisition  we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our manufacturing machinery and equipment for depreciation purposes from years to years on a prospective basis 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
these tests are performed at the reporting unit level using a two step  fair value based approach 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we first compare the carrying value of assets and liabilities to the estimated fair value 
if estimated fair value is less than carrying value  then potential impairment exists 
the amount of any impairment is then calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill using a hypothetical purchase price allocation  similar to that which would be applied if it were an acquisition and the purchase price was equivalent to fair value as calculated in the first step 
impairment is equivalent to any excess of goodwill carrying value over its implied fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis  including calculating fair value of each reporting unit based on estimated future cash flows and discount rates to be applied 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item in this annual report on form k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we and our principal subsidiaries use us dollars as our functional currency because most of the transactions are conducted and settled in us dollars 
all of our revenue and a significant portion of our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
the functional currency for our in house packaging and testing facilities in china is us dollars and a significant portion of our capital expenditures are denominated in us dollars 
however  foreign currencies are required to fund our overseas operations  primarily in taiwan and china 
operating expenses of overseas operations are denominated in their respective local currencies 
in order to minimize exposure to foreign currencies  we maintained cash and cash equivalent balances in foreign currencies  including chinese yuan rmb as operating funds for our foreign operating expenses 
our management believes that our exposure to foreign currency translation risk is not significant based on a sensitivity analysis in foreign currencies due to the fact that the net assets denominated in foreign currencies pertaining to foreign operations  principally in taiwan and china  are not significant to our consolidated net assets 
interest rate risk our interest bearing assets comprise mainly interest bearing short term bank balances 
we manage our interest rate risk by placing such balances in instruments with various short term maturities 
borrowings expose us to interest rate risk 
borrowings are drawn down after due consideration of market conditions and expectation of future interest rate movements 
in the past  our borrowings have been subject to floating interest rates  and future borrowings may expose us to cash flow interest rate risk 
we had outstanding borrowings of million at june  we do not believe that a change in interest rates would materially affect our results of operations 
commodity price risk we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials  particularly gold  that are used in our manufacturing process and incorporated into our end products 
supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted  or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities 
over the past few years  the price of gold increased significantly and certain of our supply chain partners assess surcharges to compensate for the rising commodity prices 
we have been converting some of our products to use copper wires instead of gold wires 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price changes for these raw materials 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used and could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices 
we do not enter into formal hedging arrangements to mitigate against commodity risk 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials such as gold  subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our current year net earnings by million  assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices
