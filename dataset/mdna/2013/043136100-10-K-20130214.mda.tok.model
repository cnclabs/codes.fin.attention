overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets surgical products  many of which are based on our minimally invasive patented coblation technology 
our products are used across several medical specialties  improving many existing soft tissue surgical procedures and enabling new minimally invasive surgical procedures 
our business consists of one operating and reportable segment for the development  manufacturing and marketing of disposable devices and implants for select surgical procedures 
the product development  manufacturing and other supporting functions  such as regulatory affairs and distribution  are common across our company 
we organize and manage our sales and marketing functions according to geography and the surgical procedure that typically employs our products 
most of the company products are used in sports medicine or ent procedures 
key financial items  trends and uncertainties affecting our business our management reviews and analyzes several metrics and ratios in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our operating performance 
the most important of these financial metrics and ratios include product sales growth our principal source of revenue has come from and is expected to continue to come from sales of disposable surgical devices and implants 
product sales are made through our employed sales representatives  independent sales agents and distributors 
reported product sales in included the recognition of million of product sales that had been previously deferred pending the outcome of certain contract matters 
excluding the impact of the deferred revenue recognized in  product sales growth for  and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
in  and  international sales comprised percent  percent and percent of our consolidated product sales 
changes in the us dollar exchange rate of foreign currencies in which we operate reduced the u 
s dollar value of product sales by million in  increased product sales by million in and increased product sales million in in constant currency  product sales increased percent  decreased percent and increased percent for the years ended  and management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency is 
table of contents an important metric for evaluating our operations because the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates may not provide an accurate baseline for analyzing trends in our business 
to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency  we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year sales at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates 
constant currency is a non gaap measure and should not be considered as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
we contract manufacture disposable surgical devices and implants based on our technologies for other medical devices companies which is included in product sales 
product sales from contract manufacturing for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we also generate revenue from royalties from licensing our products and technology to other companies  and earn other revenues from shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
gross product margin gross product margin as a percentage of product sales in   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
cost of product sales consists of all product manufacturing costs including material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty and other direct product costs  adjustments to the carrying value of inventory for excess or obsolete items  certain stock based compensation costs associated with manufacturing and operations personnel and costs of product shipped to our customers 
cost of product sales also includes the amortization of controller units and instruments that have been placed at customer locations to enable the use of our disposable surgical products 
we maintain ownership of all placed controllers and instruments and the costs are amortized into cost of product sales over their estimated useful life 
our manufactured products are mostly produced at our costa rica facility 
raw materials used to produce our products are generally not subject to substantial commodity price volatility 
most of our product manufacturing costs are incurred in us dollars 
the comparability of gross product margin between periods will be impacted by several items  including the mix between proprietary and contract manufactured product sales  the stability of the average sales price we realize on proprietary products  changes in foreign exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated sales into us dollars  changes in the estimated percentage of engineering activities related to manufacturing process design or improvement  and changes in our product emphasis which could result in excess and obsolescence charges being included in the cost of product sales in a particular period 
the patient protection and affordable care act which was signed into law in march imposes a new excise tax on our us product sales from january   which will lower our gross product margin beginning in operating margin operating margin is our income from operations as a percentage of total revenues 
the key operating expenses incurred in connection with our ongoing business activities are research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative activities  as well as the amortization of intangible assets 
we also incur investigation and restatement related costs in connection with the doj investigation concerning us as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and indemnification costs associated with certain of our former officers 
operating margin for  and was percent  negative percent and percent  respectively 
under the short term incentive plan for approved by our board of directors  adjusted operating margin is a key metric for purposes of evaluating management performance 
adjusted operating margin is operating margin adjusted for investigation and restatement related costs 
investigation and restatement related costs were percent  percent and percent of total 
table of contents revenue for  and respectively  and adjusted operating margin was percent  percent and percent for these same periods 
adjusted operating margin is a non gaap measure of profitability and it should not be considered as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
we completed the relocation of our sunnyvale  california operations to austin  texas in december of in the second quarter of  the company entered into a sublease for its former austin  texas location which decreased the amount accrued for contract termination by million 
in we incurred million in exit costs and we reported an additional million of aggregate costs related to the relocation of our sunnyvale  california activities to austin  texas that did not meet the definition of exit costs 
this included costs of product sales of million  research and development costs of million  sales and marketing costs of million  and  general and administrative costs of million 
these expenses include accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements related to facilities that ceased to be used upon completion of the relocation  personnel recruiting and training expense  and  duplicate rent and employee cost  offset by forfeited stock compensation 
net earnings net earnings will be affected by the same trends that impact our revenues  gross product margin and operating margin 
in addition  net earnings will also be affected by other income and expenses  such as foreign currency gains and losses  and by income taxes 
we expect that we will report foreign currency gains or losses each period due primarily to changes in the value of the euro  british pound and australian dollar versus the us dollar 
our effective income tax rate is less than the us statutory rate as a substantial portion of our operations are outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates  including costa rica  where we have a tax holiday that extends through december in years of loss  our effective tax rate has exceeded the us statutory rate due to the apportionment of income or loss between jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expect to be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  which amounted to million as of december

the closing of the transaction was conditioned upon eleven blade obtaining united states food and drug administration clearance for certain suture based anchor products  which was received in january  and we subsequently paid million in cash and closed the acquisition 
in addition  the agreement provides that we will pay the sellers a one time earn out payment based on the net sales of q fix products during the three year period following the full commercialization of these products in the united states

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires our management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts of revenue  expenses  income  assets and liabilities  reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which our management uses judgment  assumptions and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements 
we describe our most significant accounting policies in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following accounting policies as those that require significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and that have a significant impact on our 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations 
these policies are considered critical because they may result in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period due to the significant judgments  estimates and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement providing for the sale of a product  delivery of the product has occurred  the sale price of the product is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
other revenues include shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
shipping and handling costs incurred are presented as a part of cost of product sales 
for product sales made by our direct sales professionals or independent agents  our criteria for revenue recognition are usually complete when our product is delivered to end customers  such as surgical centers or hospitals 
these sales occur either in fulfillment of a purchase order submitted by the customer or through trunk sales 
for purchase orders  we ship product to and invoice the end customer directly 
for trunk sales  product is hand delivered at the end customer premises from trunk stock maintained by the direct sales representative or independent agent and a bill only order is received notifying us of the product delivery at which time we invoice the end customer 
sales to distributors occur either as stocking and replenishment orders or as drop shipments to end customers 
in the majority of cases involving sales to distributors  our requirements for revenue recognition are met when we deliver product to a particular distributor 
in the case of certain distributors we had agreed to pricing reductions based on the distributors ultimate reselling price and in those cases we recognized revenue on a sell through basis only after the distributor had sold our products to an end user 
in order to determine the amount of sell through revenue that should be recognized during a given reporting period  we relied on reports from the distributors that provided us with information about sales to end customers during the reporting period as well as the amount and types of our products in the distributor inventory at the end of a reporting period 
our management was required to exercise a significant level of judgment to determine the accuracy and reliability of the reported information 
we used a first in first out accounting method to account for products sold by these distributors where we applied the sell through method 
these distributors have subsequently been converted to sales agents and revenues are now recognized when products are delivered to the end customer 
our customers generally have the right to return or exchange products purchased from us for up to days from the date of product shipment 
at each period end  we determine the extent to which our revenues need to be reduced to account for returns and exchanges and we record a reserve against revenue recognized during that period for product returns and exchanges that our management estimates are likely to occur after the end of that period 
we base these estimates on our historical experience with our customers 
we had an agreement with one former customer that provided for an extended right of exchange 
our management concluded that the duration of the exchange agreement with this former customer was inconsistent with our revenue recognition criteria and as a result revenue related to product sales to this customer was deferred until the related right of exchange period expired during the first quarter of our revenue recognition is also impacted by management estimate of our customers ability to pay us pursuant to the terms of our customer agreements 
if after we have recognized revenue  collectability of an account receivable becomes doubtful  we will establish an allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts with respect to the previously recognized revenue that remains uncollected 
where our management forms a judgment that a particular customer has not established a sufficient credit history but decides to deliver products to the customer  we will defer recognizing revenues on product sales to that customer until collectability is reasonably assured  which typically coincides with the collection of cash 
once the customer establishes a reliable payment history we generally return to normal revenue recognition based on our criteria 
we regularly review the creditworthiness of our customers considering such factors as historical collection experience  a customer current credit standing  the age of accounts receivable balances  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer ability to pay both individually and in the aggregate 
although the terms of our agreements with many of our customers provide that risk of loss passes to the customer upon shipment  we have historically accepted the risk of loss until product delivery 
accordingly  we only recognize revenues on a product sale if  in management judgment  it has been delivered during the relevant reporting period 
the application of this policy requires our management to make estimates as to the timing of deliveries 
we base these estimates on our historical experience with product shipments to particular markets that we serve 
we periodically compare these estimates to actual results based on delivery confirmations to determine whether a change of estimate is required 
royalties are recognized as earned  based on our estimates using current and historical trends reported to us by our licensees and adjusted for market factors  and are classified as royalties  fees and other revenues in the accompanying statements of comprehensive income 
inventory allowance we value our inventory based on cost 
we adjust the value of our inventory to the extent our management determines that our cost cannot be recovered due to obsolescence or other factors 
in order to make these determinations  our management uses estimates of future demand and sales prices for each product to determine appropriate inventory reserves and to make corresponding reductions in inventory values to reflect the lower of cost or market value 
long lived assets our goodwill balance is not amortized to expense  instead it is tested for impairment at least annually on october in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the fasb new guidance on performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
if events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses  we perform an impairment analysis of goodwill at that date 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis  including the identification of our reporting units  qualitative indicators of changes to a reporting unit fair value  and determination of the reporting unit fair value 
changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in further goodwill impairment charges 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management 
on october   we performed our required annual goodwill impairment test 
we determined that we have one reporting unit and thus all of our operations  assets  and liabilities were allocated to the one reporting unit 
our closing stock price on october   was and we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding representing an imputed market capitalization of million 
our book value on october  was million  thus the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting unit and no further testing was required 
intangible assets with finite lives and property  plant and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
we monitor conditions related to these assets to 
table of contents determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period 
we test these assets for potential impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the original estimate of an asset useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us and other loss contingencies are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue a charge against income when our management determines that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  we accrue for the authoritative judgments or assertions made against us by government agencies at the time of their rendering regardless of our intent to appeal 
in determining the appropriate accounting for loss contingencies  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual should be established or adjusted 
estimating the probability that a loss will occur and estimating the amount of a loss or a range of loss involves significant judgment 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets when we expect the amount of tax benefit to be realized is less than the carrying value of the deferred tax asset 
we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested 
while we may have concluded in the past that undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances may change in the future 
changes in facts and circumstances may include a change in the estimated capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  or a change in our corporate liquidity requirements 
such changes could result in our management determining that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in that event  we would be required to recognize income tax liabilities on the assumption that our foreign undistributed earnings will be distributed to the us accounting for income taxes involves uncertainty and judgment on how to interpret and apply tax laws and regulations within our annual tax filings 
such uncertainties from time to time may result in a tax position that may be challenged and overturned by a tax authority in the future which could result in additional tax liability  interest charges and possibly penalties 
an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
this can be a subjective and judgmental determination 
the liability for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is recorded as other non current liabilities 
interest on unpaid taxes and penalties when incurred are classified as a component of income tax expense 
series a convertible preferred stock our series a preferred stock is classified as mezzanine equity and is shown on our balance sheet net of issuance costs 
the difference between the carrying value of the series a preferred stock and its 
table of contents redemption value is accreted over years using the effective interest method 
as the series a preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder  we immediately amortized the entire amount of the beneficial conversion feature  as determined on the date of issuance  as a dividend 
additional dividends are accrued at the stated rate each period so that the mezzanine equity carrying value will equal its redemption value on the fifth anniversary of the issuance when any remaining unconverted series a preferred stock could be redeemable at the option of the holder 
dividends declared on the series a preferred stock shares  the accretion of issuance costs and amortization of the beneficial conversion feature reduce the amount of net earnings that are available to common stockholders and are presented together as a separate amount on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring and recognizing as compensation expense the fair value of all share based payment awards made to employees  including employee stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights sars and restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and sars that only have service or performance conditions 
we use the monte carlo pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and restricted stock awards that have market based conditions 
the inputs to both pricing models require a number of management estimates such as volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term 
management estimates the expected volatility of our stock and employee exercise behavior based on historical data as well as expectations of future developments over the term of the stock compensation award 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us traded treasury bond with a maturity rate closest to the expected life of the stock compensation award 
as stock based compensation expense is based on the number of stock compensation awards expected to vest  we must make estimates regarding whether or not the performance and service conditions will be achieved 
these estimates are made at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods which might result in a significant change in stock based compensation expense in future periods 
recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting pronouncements may have a significant effect on our results of operations  our financial condition  our net worth or our business operations 
during  the company adopted fasb asu comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income which provided new requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  primarily risks from changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our interest income is dependent on changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and various deposit accounts 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for our cash and cash equivalents in thousands  except percentages cash and cash equivalents average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents less than 
table of contents foreign currency risk a significant portion of our international sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that the exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate against the us dollar  we will experience variations in our results of operations and financial condition 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  are denominated primarily in us dollars  however  we also maintain balances in various other currencies in support of local subsidiary operations 
the most significant of these are euros  british pounds  swedish kroner  swiss francs  australian dollars  and costa rican colones 
a percent change in the december  exchange rates for these currencies would have an impact on pre tax income of approximately million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange risk and do not anticipate doing so in the future
