item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to our plans  estimates  beliefs and anticipated future financial performance 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this filing 
overview we believe we are the leading global provider of commercial mobile wi fi internet solutions 
our software applications and solutions enable individuals to access our extensive global wi fi network of over  hotspots with devices such as smartphones  laptops and tablet computers 
our offerings provide compelling cost and performance advantages to our customers and partners 
we grew revenue from million in to million in  an increase of 
we grew revenue from million in to million in  an increase of 
our net income attributable to common stockholders increased from million in to million in we grew adjusted ebitda from million in to million in  an increase of 
for a discussion of adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common stockholders to adjusted ebitda  see footnote to selected financial data in part ii  item many online consumer and business activities  such as streaming media  social networking  downloading large email attachments and video calling  require high speed  high bandwidth internet access 
in addition  the proliferation of smartphones  laptops  tablet computers and other wi fi enabled devices has led users to expect access to the same content and information while on the go  with the same performance quality they are accustomed to in the home or office setting 
these data intensive activities are driving a global surge in mobile internet data traffic that is expected to increase times between and  according to cisco visual networking index 
we believe these trends present us with opportunities to generate significant growth in revenue and profitability 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission sec requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  business combinations  goodwill  measuring recoverability of long lived assets  stock based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we believe the accounting policies discussed below are paramount to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management judgments  assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from several sources including i retail customers under subscription plans for month to month network access that automatically renew  and retail single use access from sales of hourly  daily or other single use access plans  ii platform service arrangements with wholesale customers that provide software licensing  network access  and professional services fees  iii wholesale customers that are telecom operators under long term contracts for access to our das at our managed and operated locations  and iv display advertisements and sponsorships on our walled garden sign in pages 
software licensed by our wholesale platform services customers can only be used during the term of the service arrangements and has no utility to them upon termination of the service arrangement 
subscription fees from retail customers are paid monthly in advance and revenue is deferred for the portions of monthly recurring subscription fees collected in advance 
we do not have a stated or published refund policy for our wi fi service  although our customer service representatives will provide a refund on a case by case basis 
these amounts are not significant and are recorded as contra revenue in the period the refunds are made 
subscription fee revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
revenue generated from retail single use access is recognized when earned 
services provided to wholesale partners under platform service arrangements generally contain several elements including i a term license to use our software to access our wi fi network  ii access fees for network usage  and iii professional services for software integration and customization and to maintain the wi fi service 
the term license  monthly minimum network access fees and professional services are billed on a monthly basis based upon predetermined fixed rates 
once the term license for integration and customization are delivered  the fees from the arrangement are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the platform service arrangement 
the initial term of platform service license agreements is generally between two to five years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses 
revenue for network access fees in excess of the monthly minimum amounts is recognized when earned 
all elements within existing platform service arrangements are generally delivered and earned concurrently throughout the term of the respective service arrangement 
revenue generated from access to our das networks consists of build out fees and recurring access fees under certain long term contracts with telecom operators 
build out fees paid upfront are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period  once the build out is complete 
minimum monthly access fees for usage of the das networks are non cancellable and generally escalate on an annual basis 
these minimum monthly access fees are recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period 
the initial term of our 
table of contents contracts with telecom operations and wholesale partners generally range from three to fifteen years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses 
revenue from network access fees in excess of the monthly minimums is recognized when earned 
in instances where the minimum monthly network access fees escalate over the term of the wholesale service arrangement  an unbilled receivable is recognized when performance is within our control and when we have reasonable assurance that the unbilled receivable balance will be collected 
for multiple deliverable arrangements entered into prior to january  that are accounted for under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we defer recognition of revenue for the full arrangement and recognize all revenue ratably over the wholesale service period for platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for das arrangements  as we did not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
for multiple deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  that are accounted for under asc  we evaluate whether or not separate units of accounting exist and then allocate the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method using estimated selling prices as vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence is not available 
we recognize the revenue associated with the separate units of accounting upon completion of such services or ratably over the wholesale service period for platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for das arrangements 
advertising and other revenue is recognized when the services are performed 
business combinations we allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date  with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
an income  market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination 
the income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using i discrete financial forecasts  which rely on management estimates of revenue and operating expenses  ii long term growth rates and iii an appropriate discount rate 
the market valuation method uses prices paid for a reasonably similar asset by other purchasers in the market  with adjustments relating to any differences between the assets 
the cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at prices at the time of the acquisition reduced for depreciation of the asset 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value 
we perform our impairment test annually on december st 
in september  the fasb issued revised guidance to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
if  after assessing qualitative factors  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if deemed necessary  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first 
table of contents step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  there is an indication that goodwill maybe impaired and the amount of the loss  if any  is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss  if any  is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
at december  and  we tested our goodwill for impairment and no impairment was identified as the fair value of our sole reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount 
to date  we have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges 
measuring recoverability of long lived assets we perform an impairment review of long lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators  we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or other indices of fair value 
we would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset 
to date  we have not recorded any long lived asset impairment charges 
stock based compensation stock based compensation consists of stock options granted to employees and non employees 
it is recorded as compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recognize stock based compensation expense related to employee stock option and restricted stock grants  which requires us to recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value on a straight line basis  net of estimated and actual forfeitures  over the employee requisite service period 
prior to our ipo  in and  we granted options to purchase shares of our common stock 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our ipo  determining the fair value of our common stock required making complex and subjective judgments and there was inherent uncertainty in our estimate of fair value 
prior to our ipo  our general policy was to grant employee options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the time of grant  as determined by us and our board of directors 
to determine the fair value of our common stock  we considered many factors  including our current and historical financial performance  our expected future financial performance  our financial condition at the grant date  the liquidation rights and other preferences of our preferred stock  input from management  the lack of marketability of our common stock  the anticipation or likelihood of a potential liquidity event such as a sale of the business or ipo  the condition of and outlook for our industry  
table of contents the business risks inherent in our business  the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies  and the united states and global capital market conditions 
to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock at each grant date  we conducted a periodic in depth valuation analysis of our common stock prepared with the assistance of an independent valuation firm and also considered the factors noted above 
our valuation analysis followed the guidance set forth by the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  referred to herein as the aicpa practice aid 
based on the guidance of the aicpa practice aid  we utilized a combination of valuation methods including an income approach using an analysis of expected future discounted cash flows and a market approach for similar companies with publicly traded ownership interests market comparable method 
we then weighted these two valuations to calculate an expected business enterprise value which was applied to our capital structure to determine a value per common share 
the expected future discounted cash flows analysis identifies a level of annual cash flows for a finite number of years and a residual value at the end of the projection period 
a discount rate which reflects estimates of investor required rates of return for similar investments is used to calculate the present value 
the market comparable method uses valuation multiples of comparable companies which are applied to our operating statistics to arrive at a value 
these two business enterprise values are then equally weighted to determine the total valuation 
to estimate the value of common shares  we used a dynamic option model to value the various components of our capital structure 
these components included common shares  liquidation rights and preferences of our preferred stock  warrants and options on common shares 
the total value of these securities was divided by the number of fully converted shares to provide an estimated value of common shares on a marketable  controlling interest 
a discount for lack of control and lack of marketability was then applied to yield the value per common share 
income taxes income taxes are provided based on the liability method  which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
the liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted 
the liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
we may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
upon our adoption of the related standard  there was no liability for uncertain tax positions due to the fact that there were no material identified tax benefits that were considered uncertain positions 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we evaluate the need for  and the adequacy of  valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include historical earnings  our latest forecast of taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 

table of contents our effective tax rates are primarily affected by the amount of our taxable income or losses in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  the amount of federal and state net operating losses and tax credits  the extent to which we can utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits and certain benefits related to stock option activity

connects 
this metric shows how often individuals connect to our global wi fi network in a given period 
the connects include retail and wholesale customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees 
we count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their hour period 
this measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network

we expect that these requirements will be our principal needs for liquidity over the near term 
our capital expenditures in were million  of which million was reimbursed through revenue for das build out projects from our telecom operator customers 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  working capital and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  planned capital expenditures and potential acquisitions for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that future industry specific or other developments  general economic trends  or other matters will not adversely affect our operations or our ability to meet our future cash requirements 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and size of our managed and operated location expansion efforts  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions 
we may enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses  applications or technologies which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing
