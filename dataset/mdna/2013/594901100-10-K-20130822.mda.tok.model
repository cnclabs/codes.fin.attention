item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for additional geographic data 
our international business and presence expose us to certain risks  such as currency  interest rate and political risks 
with respect to currency risk  we transact business in different currencies primarily through our foreign subsidiaries 
the fluctuation of currencies impacts sales and profitability 
frequently  sales and the costs associated with those sales are not denominated in the same currency 
we transacted business in currencies in both fiscal years and  and currencies in fiscal year the relative currency mix over the past three fiscal years was as follows of reported revenues fiscal year ended june  exchange rates to us dollar as of june  revenues by currency united states dollar european euro british pound sterling australian dollar swiss franc canadian dollar mexican peso norway krona singapore dollar sweden krona all other currencies total calculated using weighted average exchange rates for the fiscal year 
the of reported revenue for all other currencies is calculated based on the weighted average twelve month exchange rates for all other currencies 
the exchange rates to us dollar for all other currencies represents the weighted average june exchange rates for the currencies 
weighting is based on the twelve month fiscal year revenue for each country or region whose currency is included in the all other currencies category 
revenues from each currency included in all other currencies were less than of our total revenues for the period 
a increase or decrease in the value of both the euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar in fiscal year would have affected total revenues by an aggregate of approximately million  or 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a weighted average change in the exchange rate during the year with all other variables being held constant 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the effect of exchange rate changes on either cost of sales  operating expenses  or income taxes  and accordingly  is not an indicator of the effect of potential exchange rate changes on our net income attributable to micros systems  inc common shareholders 
we also are subject to interest rate fluctuations in foreign countries to the extent that we elect to borrow in the local foreign currency 
in the past  this has not been an issue of concern as we have the capacity to elect to borrow in other jurisdictions with more favorable interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate the need to invest in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations 
finally  we are subject to  among others  those environmental and geopolitical risks  and economic  pricing  financial  and other risks described in item a  risk factors 
patents and trademarks we hold six patents through our jtech subsidiary 
we also acquired an additional patents as part of our acquisition of torex retail holdings  ltd 
torex in may in general  we believe that  historically  our competitive position has not been materially dependent upon patent protection 
the technology used in the design and manufacture of most of our hardware products is largely licensed or purchased from third parties 
with respect to our software products  we have historically relied on nondisclosure agreements and applicable us and foreign copyright and trademark laws for protection 
in the us and in most other countries  we believe that applicable law has provided and will continue to provide us with sufficient protection 
there are risks that third party entities  including competitors  could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property 
given these potential risks  we have implemented procedures to monitor misappropriation of our intellectual property 
if a misappropriation is detected  we pursue appropriate legal action when we determine that such action is appropriate

we also own numerous other trademarks and servicemarks 
this annual report on form k also contains trademarks  trade names and servicemarks of other companies that are the property of their respective owners 
effect of political uncertainty  international events  and economic conditions on our business  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  clients our operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future depending upon various factors  including the timing of new product introductions  changes in our pricing and promotion policies and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products and the capital expenditure budgets of our clients 
political uncertainty and international events that often are unpredictable  eg  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  and the volatile and unpredictable political climate in the middle east  are expected to continue to adversely impact travel and tourism and therefore our operating results 
in addition  over the last several fiscal years  world macroeconomic conditions and tightened credit markets have resulted in reduced demand from clients generally 
these conditions have made it harder for  and  in some cases  may have prevented  some clients from obtaining financing for intended purchases 
we believe that these economic conditions may have resulted in reduced demand for our products and services 
historically  our business has been affected by seasonal trends 
for example  the european summer holidays tend to lower our sales volume in the european countries during our first fiscal quarter  as compared to other quarters 
we also experience a stronger than average sales volume for the retail products and services in our second fiscal quarter due to the holiday season 
additionally  with the relative slowdown in corporate buying at the beginning of each calendar year  which is our third fiscal quarter  seasonal weakness for the third quarter ending march has been experienced 
therefore  we believe that sequential quarter to quarter historic comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
no single customer accounts for or more of our consolidated revenues 
during fiscal years  and  we have been a party  directly and indirectly  to certain contracts with the us federal government  which contracts contained standard termination for convenience clauses 
our us government related revenue for fiscal years  and constituted less than of our total consolidated revenue for each of those fiscal years 
we do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact if the us government elected to exercise its rights under a termination for convenience clause 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and do not anticipate that environmental compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations 
backlog we generally have an order backlog equal to approximately three months revenue 
substantially all orders in the backlog are cancelable at any time before shipment of hardware and software or rendering of services 
as of june   and  our total backlog  including both the order backlog and maintenance backlog  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  only an immaterial portion of the backlog existing as of the first day of the fiscal year does not result in recognizable revenue in that fiscal year

item a 
risk factors there are a number of risks to which we are subject 
these risks include the following environmental and geopolitical risks 
while we do not sell our products and services directly to consumers  changes in consumer habits in response to environmental or geopolitical risks affect demand for our products and services by the hospitality and tourism industries 
our business is very sensitive to the threat of terrorism and political uncertainty 
as the hospitality and tourism industries we serve are highly sensitive to consumer sentiments caused by world events  we are very vulnerable to downturns in customer buying habits associated with the threat of terrorist attacks and uncertain political climates  such as those existing in the middle east and parts of asia 
our business is very sensitive to environmental  natural  and health disasters 
actual  anticipated or perceived environmental events  natural disasters  and epidemics  including for example  hurricanes  tsunamis  and disease  will deter and delay purchases of our products by clients  as concerns about potential or anticipated instances of environmental events  natural disasters  or health disasters tend to suppress travel and tourism 
environmental disasters also adversely affect our operations in the distressed areas 
higher oil and gas prices worldwide could have a material adverse impact on the travel and tourism industries  and indirectly  on our business 
material increases in oil and gas prices tend to reduce discretionary spending by consumers  such as on travel and dining  as well as on retail spending generally 
reductions in discretionary spending by consumers adversely affect our clients and  indirectly  our business 
moreover  increases in oil and gas prices also directly adversely affect our customer base in other ways 
for example  oil and gas price increases can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our food and beverage clients 
we maintain offices and rely on distributors in parts of the world that are subject to economic instability  political unrest  and terrorism  such as the middle east 
the performance of our offices or distributors in these areas likely will be adversely affected if countries in these regions become subject to economic decline  political strife or episodes of terrorism 
for example  because of political and social unrest in greece and egypt  among others  our local dealers respective businesses have been materially adversely impacted 
economic  pricing and financial risks 
we are subject to the variability of world economies 
since a majority of our business is conducted in foreign countries  a downturn in the economies of foreign countries would adversely affect our financial results 
while  under certain circumstances  reliance on foreign operations can have a moderating impact as one region s improving conditions may offset another region s declining conditions  our foreign businesses nonetheless add a degree of uncertainty to our planning and forecasting processes 
we are subject to the global economic crisis 
in the summer of  global economic conditions materially worsened 
while there has been some improvement subsequently  economic conditions continue to languish 
we believe these economic conditions resulted in reduced demand from clients and the inability of some clients to secure financing for intended purchases 
the current economic stagnation may continue to result in the reduced demand for our products and services 
slowdown of worldwide economic growth has resulted in reduced consumer spending  which has adversely impacted our clients 
these economic conditions may also increase our uncollectable receivables 
our financial results are dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders and the shipment of products for large orders 
large software orders from clients may account for a meaningful portion of earnings in any period 
we expect the clients with whom we do the largest amount of business to vary from year to year as a result of the timing of the rollout of each client s system 
further  if a customer delays or accelerates its delivery requirements  or if a product s completion is delayed or accelerated  our results for a particular period could be adversely affected 
our ability to establish pricing is subject to rapidly changing market and competitive conditions 
to be competitive and to avoid losing business on the basis of price  we must evaluate our pricing routinely 
there are instances where we may have to reduce our prices to obtain business 
market forces have and will continue to increase pressure on our gross margins and overall profitability 
this is especially true with hardware  where prices continue to decline 
our gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter based upon product mix 
product mix can affect our operating results 
for example  as we enjoy a higher gross margin on software than on hardware  our overall gross margin will vary depending upon the percentage of software licensed and the percentage of hardware sold each quarter 
the difficulty in predicting product mix on a quarter to quarter basis results in uncertainty in projecting gross margin  and we have experienced a degree of variability in our gross margins on a quarter to quarter basis as a result of changes in product mix 
our non major account business is difficult to predict 
our major account clients generally those clients who operate or more locations have longer sales cycles and deployments  our non major account sales have much shorter sales cycles and shorter deployments 
as a significant portion of our business involves non major accounts  there is inherent difficulty in predicting buying patterns 
accordingly  it is much harder to appropriately staff and prepare for fluctuations in buying demand for non major account clients 
this can result in inefficiencies that adversely affect our operating results 
some of the advanced systems we sell are very complex and require a high level of technical sophistication  which may result in increased costs that adversely affect our operating results 
the costs of the implementation and operation of an effective service structure capable of addressing increasingly complex software systems in wildly diverse locations is high and may require us to engage contractors  for whom we generally incur higher costs than we incur with respect to our own associates 
we also face additional costs due to the complexity of open systems  which generally incorporate third party software products that may entail difficult and costly support and service  and due to the difficulty in implementing  operating  maintaining and supporting centrally hosted systems  such as central reservation systems  and centrally hosted property management systems and reporting systems 
we are subject to certain material cost increases that may be out of our control 
while we attempt to control third party costs  we have little or no control over certain significant expenses  such as health care costs which are generally experience based and costs of compliance with new legislation 
significant increases in any of these expenses could adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies and exchange rates 
because we conduct significant portions of our business in foreign currencies  we experience exchange rate fluctuations that can have a significant impact on our reported results 
for example  as much of our european business is transacted in euros  our revenue on a consolidated basis will decline if the euro weakens relative to the us dollar and increase if the euro strengthens relative to the us dollar 
we have a large exposure in europe 
micros has historically had a large presence in europe  with offices in most major european cities 
with the acquisition of torex in may  our presence in europe has increased 
given the uncertain economy of several member nations in the european union  and with mounting debt in certain european countries such as greece  spain  italy and portugal  we confront increased risk of customer defaults and decreased demand for our products 
as a publicly traded company  our stock price is subject to certain market trends that are out of our control and that may not reflect our actual operating performance 
we can experience short term increases and declines in our stock price due to factors other than those specific to our business  such as economic news or other events generally affecting the trading markets 
we have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances 
while we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments generally considered to be relatively safe  we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks 
for example  we invested some of our cash in auction rate securities  which proved to be illiquid when the financial resale markets contracted in february while we eventually were able to liquidate our entire remaining portfolio of auction rate securities in fiscal year without any material adverse effect on our business  our experience with these securities underscores the potential risks related to our investments 
in addition  bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts  if any 
our internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that all fraud will be detected 
while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met  and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our company have been detected 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
we are subject to income and sales taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income and sales taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are routinely under audit by multiple tax authorities throughout the world 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 
the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
further  any changes to the us or any foreign jurisdictions tax laws or tax rates could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed 
although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation changes may pass  if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense  deferred tax assets and cash flows 
technology risks 
our clients requirements are increasingly sophisticated 
to continue to offer competitive products and meet our clients requirements  we must continually develop and update our products 
unexpected costs and delays in development and implementation  and the need to address our commitments to various customers  could adversely affect our financial results 
the development of software is an inherently difficult process that may result in software bugs that adversely impact a client s business 
while we have a testing and beta program and protocol that we implement before the general release of any product  such processes cannot guarantee that the released software will not have any bugs 
our business could be adversely affected if these problems are significant and cannot readily be resolved 
the manufacturing of our hardware platforms is performed primarily by a singapore based third party contract manufacturer  venture group of singapore venture group 
while we believe we have a good relationship with venture group  and have not experienced any material manufacturing problems with venture group  we cannot be certain that the relationship will remain in force  nor can we be certain that venture group will not experience labor or manufacturing challenges in the future  which may include claims of patent infringement with respect to key product components 
additionally  venture group procures many of its components from other third parties that could experience manufacturing or labor issues 
we believe that  if our relationship with venture group were to terminate  we could replace venture group with other contract manufacturers or resell appropriate third party hardware products in lieu of those manufactured for us by venture group 
however  any disruption or interruption of the supply of hardware products from venture group could materially adversely affect our business in the short run 
large customized deployments may be difficult and may result in cost overruns that are not recoverable 
we have some contracts under which we are required to provide systems and services at a fixed price 
we may be contractually required to absorb costs that may not be recoverable if we underestimate the amount of work required or if we encounter unanticipated technical issues 
this risk can be pronounced given the complexity of some of the systems we install and the size and scope of some of the deployments 
unanticipated costs that are not recoverable could adversely affect our operations 
our investment in certain technologies may prove to be unsuccessful and may delay our focus on more promising technologies 
we make significant investments in research and development 
our investments entail a risk that we will pursue technologies that we ultimately determine are not marketable or do not achieve the desired solution 
in such an event  we may be required to write off our investment  which could have an adverse impact on our operating income 
moreover  if we are delayed in deploying viable technologies  our business also could be adversely affected 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities 
our software may be used in connection with processing sensitive data eg  credit card numbers or personally identifiable information  and is sometimes used to store such data 
it may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures 
in those instances  the customer may attempt to seek damages from us 
while we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our support and other systems  we cannot assure that our customers systems will not be breached  or that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a customer  or other person  seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach  our business could be adversely affected 
hosting of software applications presents increased security risks 
as we expand our software hosting capabilities and offer more of our software applications to our customers on a hosted or software as a service saas basis  our responsibility for data  system security and system performance increases significantly 
while we believe that our current software applications comply with applicable laws and industry security requirements  and that we use appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of unauthorized access or misuse of data in the hosting center  we cannot provide absolute assurance that our hosted systems will not be breached  or that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a security breach were to occur  a customer  regulatory agency  or other person could seek redress from us  which could adversely affect our business 
hosting of software applications presents other liability risks 
additionally  as we expand our software hosting and saas capabilities and offer more of our software applications to our customers on a hosted or saas basis  our potential liability increases significantly 
specifically  an outage in our data centers can affect literally thousands of customers  resulting in losses to both micros and the impacted customers 
while we believe that our data centers have been designed and engineered to reduce the likelihood of outages  we cannot provide assurance that our hosted systems will not suffer from unanticipated outages or deficient performance 
if an unanticipated outage were to occur or if the performance of our data centers is deficient  one or more customers could suffer economic damages and seek redress from us  which could adversely affect our business 
rapidly evolving mobile technologies present both opportunities and risks 
there has been a marked advancement in mobile technologies over the several years 
while this evolution offers us the opportunity to develop and sell new mobile products for the benefit of our customers  it also creates certain risks 
for example  some of the new mobile technology is untested and may cause unanticipated business interruption or unforeseen security risks 
additionally  there are many new entrants into the markets we serve  which may create confusion and additional competitive pressures 
newly marketed and packaged payment processing offerings present both opportunities and risks 
there has been a marked proliferation of newly packaged payment processing offerings  some of which purportedly include point of sale processing capabilities 
while we have integrated many of our products with some of these new payment processing offerings  this trend also creates some confusion and uncertainty  especially with smaller customers who are in search of inexpensive solutions and require only basic transaction capabilities 
personnel risks 
we could be adversely affected by vendor labor difficulties 
some of our vendors may have associates who are protected by labor laws or who may be members of unions 
we could experience unanticipated manufacturing or supply shortages if any of our key vendors are subject to labor difficulties or work slow downs or stoppages 
we could be adversely affected by other labor difficulties 
in those countries where certain of our associates are members of unions  we could experience unanticipated interruptions or delays in our operations if we become subject to labor difficulties or work slow downs or stoppages 
our inability to hire qualified personnel  including particularly research and development personnel  could adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer requirements on an efficient basis 
finding qualified technical personnel in all the localities where our research and development facilities are located is an ongoing challenge 
if we cannot find appropriate personnel  we risk delays in satisfying customer demands  or may even lose the opportunity to provide software to the customer 
if we are required to retain a consultant because we do not have available personnel  development costs would increase 
in general  our inability to recruit and retain appropriate personnel would adversely affect our business 
legal risks 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology  these protections do not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
we cannot guarantee that we can effectively preserve the proprietary nature and competitive advantages of our products  despite our efforts to do so through a combination of trade secrets  copyright  trademark law  non disclosure agreements  and technical measures 
others could attempt to copy what we have developed  either through legal or illegal means 
moreover  others have been able to develop competitive products and services that do not violate our proprietary rights 
we are subject to litigation  which may be costly 
as a company that does business with many customers  associates  and vendors throughout the world  we are subject to litigation  including claims made by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses 
while we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation and damages  litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse effect on our business 
as part of the litigation risk  we could be subject to potentially material adverse judgments 
we are subject to claims by others that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive letters from entities that assert that we are infringing a patent 
in those instances  we assess the validity of the claims and the purported patent  and determine whether a license is appropriate or necessary 
if we conclude that a license is not necessary  there is a risk that we will be sued  we may also face indirect liability as a result of infringement claims brought against our customers 
while we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights  we have from time to time and will continue to become involved in infringement litigation 
when that occurs  we may incur significant legal expenses and  if we are found liable  we could be obligated to pay significant damages or enter into unfavorable license agreements 
credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing effort to battle identity theft and credit card fraud  which may substantially increase our expenses  breaches of our customers credit card security may adversely affect us 
we continue to work with credit card issuers to assure that our products and services comply with the credit card associations security regulations and best practices applicable to our products and services 
we cannot assure  however  that our products and services are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking 
additionally  we cannot assure that our customers will implement all of the credit card security features that we introduce  or all of the protections and procedures required by the credit card issuers 
our customers may not establish and maintain appropriate levels of firewall protection and other security measures 
if there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss  there is a potential that parties could seek damages from us 
additionally  changes in the security guidelines and laws relating to consumer privacy could require significant  unanticipated  and costly development efforts 
privacy legislation may increase our development expenses and make us vulnerable to claims 
more and more jurisdictions both domestic and international are enacting legislation that is designed to protect the privacy of certain personally identifiable information pii  such as names  dates of birth  home addresses  social security numbers and employment information 
we must continue to modify our products and systems to comply with such legislation  and to take additional steps to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of pii 
if there is unauthorized access to o disclosure of pii  there is a potential that affected parties could seek damages from us

item legal proceedings on may   a jury returned verdicts against us in the consolidated actions of roth cash register v 
micros systems  inc  et al 
the roth matter and shenango systems solutions v 
micros systems  inc  et al 
the shenango matter 
the cases initially were filed in in the court of common pleas of allegheny county  pennsylvania 
the complaints both related to the non renewal of dealership agreements in the year between us and the respective plaintiffs 
the agreements were non renewed as part of a restructuring of the dealer channel 
the plaintiffs alleged that we and certain of our subsidiaries and associates entered into a plan to eliminate the plaintiffs as authorized dealers and improperly interfere with the plaintiffs relationships with their respective existing and potential future clients and customers without compensation to the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs claimed that  as a result  we were liable for  among other things  breach of contract and tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual relationships 
in may  the jury returned verdicts against us totaling million 
both parties appealed the original verdicts on various grounds 
on december   the superior court of pennsylvania reversed and remanded the trial court judgment as to million of the award and affirmed the trial court judgment as to the remaining million of the award 
following the denial of appeals of the superior court decision by the pennsylvania supreme court on april   we accrued a charge of million in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the matter was subsequently remanded to the court of common pleas the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decisions 
on june   we paid an aggregate of approximately million to the two plaintiffs  reflecting all amounts that were determined to be owed to the plaintiff in the shenango matter and all amounts that were no longer in dispute and that were payable to the plaintiff in the roth matter  including as to each payment i interest that had accrued at the statutory rate of per annum  and ii certain reductions and offsets that were approved by the court of common pleas 
upon the conclusion of the post appeal proceedings in the trial court  the court of common pleas entered an order reducing the amount of the remaining portion of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the roth matter from million to approximately million 
we have appealed the amended judgment 
on july   the parties presented oral arguments on the appeal to the superior court 
a decision is pending 
we are and have been involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business  and we are of the opinion  based upon presently available information and the advice of counsel concerning pertinent legal matters  that any resulting liability should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
however  litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and the outcome of litigation is not predictable with assurance 
an adverse outcome in current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity

calculated as shareholders equity divided by common stock outstanding at june item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer  marketer  and servicer of enterprise applications for the global food and beverage  hotel  and retail industries 
our enterprise solutions comprise three major areas hotel information systems  food and beverage information systems  and retail information systems 
we also offer a wide range of related services 
we distribute our products and services directly and through a network of independent dealers and distributors 
we are organized and operate in four operating segments us canada  eame europe  africa and middle east  the pacific rim  and latin america regions 
we have identified our us canada operating segment as a separate reportable segment and we have aggregated our three international operating segments into one reportable segment  international  as the three international operating segments share many similar economic characteristics 
our management views the us canada and international segments separately in operating our business  although the products and services are substantially similar for each segment 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we reevaluate our estimates periodically 
the following comprise the critical accounting estimates that we used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is generated from the sale of software licenses  hardware  services and support including software as a service and is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  or services have been rendered  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collectability of the related receivable is probable 
in making judgments regarding revenue recognition  we analyze various factors  including the nature and terms of the specific transaction  the nature and terms of comparable transactions  the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical experience  accuracy of prior estimates  and overall market and economic conditions 
moreover  in connection with sales of a number of products and services under a single contractual arrangement a multiple element arrangement  we make judgments as to whether there is sufficient vendor specific objective evidence to enable the allocation of fair value among the various elements in software arrangements that contain multiple elements and as to relative selling prices for multiple element arrangements that contain hardware or other non software elements 
in determining relative selling prices for products and services  we consider  among other things  the client s geographic location  customer concentrations  our use of discounts from list prices  prices we charge for similar offerings and our historical pricing practices 
changes in judgments related to these items  or a deterioration in market or economic conditions  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires estimates and is based on the age of the receivable  customer payment practices and history  inquiries regarding the customer  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which could affect our financial results in future periods 
as of june  and  accounts receivable totaled approximately million and million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  bad debt expense for fiscal years  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out pricing method 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
nevertheless  changes in business trends  competition and other factors not apparent when  or occurring after  we make our estimates of inventory obsolescence could result in the need to undertake additional inventory write downs in future periods 
we wrote down our inventory by approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of new software products to be licensed to others  primarily consisting of salaries  employee benefits and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses until technological feasibility is established 
the capitalization of software development costs on a product by product basis starts when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized software development costs begins 
technological feasibility is established when the product reaches the working model stage 
the cost of purchased software is also capitalized 
annual amortization of capitalized software development costs is either included in software cost of sales or service cost of sales 
for each capitalized software product  the annual amortization is equal to the greater of i the amount computed using the ratio that the software product s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or ii the amount computed based on the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
if we incorrectly estimate the remaining economic life of a product or the anticipated future gross revenues of a product  we may in the future be required to take a significant write off of capitalized software development costs or to accelerate amortization  either of which could materially affect our future financial results 
amortization expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
when indicators of impairment are present  we compare the fair value of the relevant asset groups  based on the undiscounted cash flows the asset groups are expected to generate or market value  if available  to the net book value of the asset groups 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the asset group is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the net book value over the fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the asset groups for the purposes of our analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these asset groups 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the company 
a change in assumptions and estimates in future periods could cause us to determine that asset groups are impaired  resulting in a significant charge in future periods 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we assess annually  in the first quarter of the fiscal year  whether goodwill and certain of our trademarks  which are our only indefinite lived purchased intangible assets  are impaired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units our four operating segments consisting of us canada  eame  the pacific rim and latin america to their book value 
we first determine  based on a qualitative assessment  whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on a weighting of future income approach ie  discounted future income and market approach ie  a comparison to the purchase and sale of similar assets in the relevant industry 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances indicating that it is more likely than not that the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
qualitative assessments regarding goodwill involve a high degree of judgment and can entail subjective considerations 
our estimates of the fair value of the reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses require estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting units and factor in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  including assumptions relating to customer demand  changes in technology and the cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
additionally  these cash flow analyses factor in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date the analysis is performed 
a determination that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired which could result from a change in our assumptions could have a significant impact on our operating results 
as of june  and  goodwill totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
see note  goodwill in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we account for our option awards granted under our stock option program by estimating fair value of option awards as of the date of grant 
non cash share based compensation expenses  which are based on the estimated value of the option awards adjusted for expected pre vesting forfeitures  are recognized ratably over the requisite service ie vesting period of options in the consolidated statement of operations 
we value stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions 
therefore  we are required to input highly subjective assumptions about volatility rates  expected term of options  dividend yields and applicable interest rates in determining the estimated fair value 
expected volatility is based on historical stock prices 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical option activities  adjusted for the remaining option life cycle by assuming ratable exercise of any unexercised vested options over the remaining term 
for this purpose  we separate groups of associates that have historically exhibited similar behavior with regard to option exercises and post vesting cancellations 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
total share based compensation expense recorded from period to period can be significantly different depending on several variables  including the number of options granted  any changes to assumptions such as pre vesting cancellations and the estimated fair value of those vested awards 
however  unlike all of the other accounting estimates described in this section  changes in estimates regarding stock options affect only newly granted options  they do not result in a change in previously recorded amounts 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination is made 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities could be materially affected if  based on subsequent events  we determine that we must derecognize or recognize a tax position 
in connection with the purchase price allocation for the torex acquisition  we had established a gross deferred tax asset of approximately million primarily related to torex uk s net operating loss carryforwards 
the future realization of the deferred tax asset is based on recent profitability and our current forecast of the acquired businesses operations 
however  if those operations experience a significant change  whether due to future operational integration and reorganization or otherwise  we may not be able to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards 
to the extent that we are unable to use some portion of the loss carryforwards in future periods  we would be required to recognize an increase to tax expense  which could materially affect our annual tax rate in the year in which the change occurs 
although we are profitable on a consolidated basis  we have incurred losses in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we applied valuation allowances in some circumstances where the prospects of realizing the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred taxes are subject to uncertainty 
the determination of the likelihood of realizing this tax benefit requires significant judgment in some instances  and actual results of our operating subsidiaries  particularly certain international subsidiaries  could require material adjustments to our deferred tax assets or liabilities  and changes in our annual tax rate in the year in which the adjustments occur 
we review our uncertain income tax positions and apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
our net unrecognized income tax benefits were approximately million and million  including interest and penalties of approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties relating to these positions 
changes in estimates regarding our tax positions  or government determinations resulting from tax audits  could have an effect on our deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as our annual tax rate in the year in which the changes or determinations occur 
results of operations during the three fiscal years ended june   we acquired several businesses  including torex  and accordingly  our results include activities from the acquired businesses from their respective acquisition dates 
as torex was acquired on may   the results of these acquisitions did not have a material effect on our overall results during the fiscal years ended june  and see note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail on acquisitions 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year revenue the following table provides information regarding the sales mix by reportable segments in fiscal years and amounts are net of intersegment eliminations  based on location of the customer fiscal year ended june  us canada international total in thousands hardware     software     service     total revenue     the following table provides information regarding the total sales mix as a percent of total revenue in fiscal years and fiscal year ended june  hardware software service total for fiscal year  total revenue was approximately billion  an increase of approximately million  or compared to fiscal year  principally due to the following factors hardware  software and service revenue increased by  and  respectively  compared to fiscal year the increases were largely attributable to the approximately million of additional revenue generated by the acquired torex businesses during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was comprised of hardware revenue of approximately million  software revenue of approximately million and services revenue of approximately million 
current global economic uncertainty continued to have an adverse impact on revenues 
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily for the euro  brazilian real  japanese yen  and british pound sterling against the us dollar  negatively affected total revenue by approximately million 
international segment revenue for the fiscal year ended june  increased by approximately million  or compared to fiscal year  principally due to the following factors hardware  software and service revenue increased by  and  respectively  compared to fiscal year the increases were largely attributable to the approximately million of additional revenue generated by the acquired torex businesses during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was comprised of hardware revenue of approximately million  software revenue of approximately million and services revenue of approximately million 
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily for the euro  brazilian real  japanese yen  and british pound sterling against the us dollar  negatively affected total revenue by approximately million 
us canada segment revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by approximately million  or compared to fiscal year  principally due to the following factors hardware  software and service revenue decreased by  and  respectively  compared to fiscal year we believe these changes reflect a continued negative impact from macro economic conditions 
the decrease in hardware revenue was primarily due to decreased sales of our workstation products compared to fiscal year the decrease in software revenue was primarily due to decreased sales of our food and beverage and hotel software products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of our retail software products 
the decrease in service revenue was primarily due to decreases in professional services and web based marketing services  partially offset by an increase in maintenance services  reflecting the continued expansion of our customer base and new products and services offerings including hosting and software as a service 
cost of sales the following table provides information regarding our cost of sales in fiscal years and fiscal year ended june  in thousands cost of sales of related revenue cost of sales of related revenue hardware   software   service   total cost of sales   for fiscal year  cost of sales as a percent of revenue increased to compared to in fiscal year hardware cost of sales as a percent of hardware revenue for fiscal year increased compared to the same period last year 
software cost of sales as a percent of software revenue for fiscal year increased compared to the same period last year 
service costs as a percent of service revenue for fiscal year increased by compared to the same period last year 
these increases primarily reflect margins generated by torex 
when compared to our other businesses  torex generally has higher sales of non proprietary hardware  and realizes lower margins from its products and services 
excluding the impact of the torex acquisition  the hardware cost of sales as a percent of related revenue for fiscal year was comparable to fiscal year the software cost of sales as a percent of related revenue for fiscal year decreased by compared to the same period last year primarily due to lower software amortization expense included in software cost of sales for fiscal year both in amount and as a percent of revenue as compared to fiscal year the lower software amortization expense primarily reflects the full year amortization in fiscal year of capitalized software development related to one of our hotel application products and one of our e commerce solutions 
the service cost of sales as a percent of related revenue for fiscal year increased by due to unfavorable product mix between professional services and maintenance services 
micros generally realizes higher margins on installation and professional services than it does on maintenance services 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased overall cost of sales by approximately million or of total revenue 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal year  sg a expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to compared to in fiscal year  primarily due to decreases in incentive based compensation expense and bad debt expense as compared to the same period last year 
while the global economic conditions are still uncertain  we believe the decrease in bad debt expense reflects some stabilization in global economic conditions and the results of our continued focus on collection efforts related to aged receivables that previously were included in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we received million in an insurance settlement related to a fraud that occurred in japan during the fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by approximately million in restructuring charges related to our continued effort to merge the acquired torex operations into our existing global infrastructure 
although the sg a expenses as a percent of revenue for fiscal year decreased as compared to the same period last year  the amount of fiscal year sg a expenses increased by approximately million compared to fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in total compensation expenses of approximately million  related primarily to new associates who joined our company as a result of the torex acquisition in may foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased overall sg a expenses by approximately million or of total revenue 
research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of labor costs less capitalized software development costs 
the following table provides information regarding our r d expenses in fiscal years and fiscal year ended june  in thousands r d labor and other costs   capitalized software development costs   total r d expenses   of revenue the decrease in capitalized software development costs is primarily related to the completion of the development of cg  our supply chain and life cycle management tool software  during the three months ended september   and xbr ingenium  our next generation loss prevention reporting and business analytics solution  during the three months ended march  the increase in total r d expenses is primarily associated with torex r d expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal year increased approximately million compared to fiscal year to approximately million 
this increase is primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses related to our acquisition of torex 
share based compensation expenses the following table provides information regarding our recognition of non cash share based compensation expense  which was included in the sg a expenses  r d expenses and cost of sales for fiscal years and  as indicated below fiscal year ended june  in thousands  except per share data sg a   r d   cost of sales total non cash share based compensation expense   income tax benefit   total non cash share based compensation expense  net of tax benefit impact on diluted net income per share attributable to micros systems  inc common shareholders as of june   approximately million in non cash share based compensation cost related to non vested awards was not yet recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
income from operations income from operations for fiscal year decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million  compared to fiscal year the decrease reflects lower margins as a percent of revenue generated by torex  which generally has higher sales of non proprietary hardware compared to our other business  and realizes lower margins from its products and services  and an increase in costs associated with our research and development efforts  primarily related to torex r d expenses 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also contributed to the decrease in our income from operations for fiscal year by approximately million compared to fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by our continued cost cutting efforts 
non operating income expense net non operating income for fiscal year was approximately million compared to net non operating income of approximately million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to realized gains of approximately million on sale of our investments in auction rate securities during fiscal year fiscal years and also include credit based impairment losses related to our investments in auction rates securities of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net favorable fiscal year changes were partially offset by a decrease in interest income of approximately million  primarily due to lower funds available during fiscal year as a result of our use of available cash to acquire torex in may income tax expense the effective tax rates for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the fiscal years and were less than the us statutory federal income tax rate  mainly due to earnings from jurisdictions that have a lower statutory tax rate than the us  our continued determination to permanently reinvest overseas the cumulative unremitted earnings of our significant non us affiliates  tax benefits realized upon settlements with tax authorities  the expiration of statutes of limitations and the domestic manufacturing deductions 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was mainly due to a decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements with tax authorities in fiscal year and the favorable mix of earnings from jurisdictions that have a lower statutory tax rate than the us the international segment represents a larger portion of our consolidated earnings compared to fiscal year due to the acquisition of torex business in may we recorded net non current unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million and million  including accrued interest and penalties of approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
we have recognized approximately million of net interest benefit in fiscal year compared to million of interest expense in fiscal year the net interest benefit in fiscal year was due to the interests associated with the settlements with tax authorities and the expiration of statues of limitations 
the net non current unrecognized income tax benefits represents benefits with respect to which we do not anticipate making a payment within months of the balance sheet date 
if recognized  all of the net unrecognized income tax benefit would be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense  affecting the effective income tax rate 
in the ordinary course of the company s business  transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain 
under applicable accounting guidance  the company is unable to recognize the effects of a tax position in its financial statements unless the position satisfies a minimum recognition threshold mandated by the guidance 
we have recognized a net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to fiscal year  which includes a reduction in the effective tax rate of and income tax expense by approximately million  primarily due to favorable settlements with the tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations 
we estimate that within the next months  we will decrease the unrecognized income tax benefits by between approximately million to million due to the expiration of statues of limitations and settlement of issues with tax authorities  which we believe would increase earnings as a result of a reduction in tax expense 
however  audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty 
over the next months  it is reasonably possible that our tax positions will continue to generate liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we currently have no plans to repatriate to the us our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings  as we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings internationally 
if we change our strategy in the future and repatriate such funds  the amount of any us taxes due on the repatriation of such funds  which could be significant  and the application of any tax credits  would be determined based on the appropriate jurisdictional income tax laws at the time of such repatriation 
due to the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used should a decision be made in the future to repatriate  the availability and the complexity of calculating foreign tax credits  and the implications of indirect taxes  including withholding taxes  determination of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these unremitted earnings is not practicable 
based on currently available information  we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year will be approximately compared to for fiscal year the projected increase is primarily attributable to the following i fiscal year s favorable tax settlements with tax authorities and ii a decrease in interest expense deductions in fiscal year due to changes in foreign income tax law and a reduction in the uk income tax rate from to enacted in july  which will be reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of our deferred tax assets during our first quarter ending september  we believe that due to changes in the mix of earnings among jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items recognized within a financial period  there may be some degree of volatility to the quarterly tax rate 
net income attributable to micros systems  inc and diluted net income per share attributable to micros systems  inc common shareholders the net income attributable to micros systems  inc for fiscal year increased approximately million  or  to approximately million  compared to fiscal year the increase primarily reflects lower effective income tax rate  increase in total revenue and our continued cost cutting efforts 
these increases were partially offset by lower margins generated by torex  which generally has higher sales of non proprietary hardware compared to our other business  and realizes lower margins from its products and services  and additional r d expenses associated with the acquired torex operations 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also decreased the net income attributable to micros systems  inc for fiscal year by approximately million compared to fiscal year diluted net income per share attributable to our shareholders for fiscal year and was and per diluted share  respectively 
fiscal year diluted net income per share reflects approximately million lower weighted average number of shares outstanding the denominator used to calculate net income per share compared to fiscal year primarily due to approximately million shares of our common stock we purchased during the year 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased the diluted net income per share for fiscal year by per diluted share compared to fiscal year comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year revenue the following table provides information regarding the sales mix by reportable segments in fiscal years and amounts are net of intersegment eliminations  based on location of the customer fiscal year ended june  us canada international total in thousands hardware     software     service     total revenue     the following table provides information regarding the total sales mix as a percent of total revenue in fiscal years and fiscal year ended june  hardware software service total for fiscal year  total revenue was approximately billion  an increase of approximately million  or compared to fiscal year principally due to the following factors hardware  software and service revenue increased by  and  respectively  compared to fiscal year we believe the increases were primarily due to an improvement in demand from our clients as a result of a modest improvement in global economic conditions

capital resources in the ordinary course of the company s business  transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain 
under applicable accounting guidance  the company is unable to recognize the effects of a tax position in its financial statements unless the position satisfies a minimum recognition threshold mandated by the guidance 
at june   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance was approximately million  of which approximately million was held internationally 
we currently have no plans to repatriate to the us our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings  as we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings internationally 
if we change our strategy in the future and repatriate such funds  the amount of any us taxes due on the repatriation of such funds  which could be significant  and the application of any tax credits  would be determined based on the appropriate jurisdictional income tax laws at the time of such repatriation 
due to the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used should a decision be made in the future to repatriate  the availability and the complexity of calculating foreign tax credits  and the implications of indirect taxes  including withholding taxes  determination of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these unremitted earnings is not practicable 
all cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are being retained for operations  expansion of the business and the repurchase of our stock 
we have two credit agreements the credit agreements that in the aggregate provide a million multi currency committed line of credit 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the credit agreements were amended to extend their expiration date until september  we are currently negotiating a new line of credit agreement to replace the credit agreements 
we expect the new line of credit agreement to have a comparable borrowing capacity as the credit agreements and do not expect any issues in executing the new line of credit agreement by september  as of june   we had approximately million outstanding under the credit agreements 
in addition  we applied approximately million to guarantees 
we also have a credit relationship with a european bank in the amount of eur million approximately million at the june  exchange rate 
as of june   there were no balances outstanding on this credit facility  but approximately eur million approximately million at the june  exchange rate of the credit facility had been used for guarantees 
as of june   we had approximately million borrowing capacity available under all of the credit facilities described above 
we do not currently invest in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations  although we will continue to evaluate the need to do so in the future 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and our available lines of credit are sufficient to provide our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
in light of current economic conditions generally and in light of the overall performance of the stock market in recent periods  we cannot assume that funds would be available from other sources if we were required to fund significant acquisitions or any unanticipated and substantial cash needs 
we currently anticipate that our property  plant and equipment expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately million

additional forward looking statements are contained elsewhere in this report  including in the preceding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
such statements include the following i our statements about the trends in our clients industries generally and in various sectors within those industries  ii our statements regarding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations in particular  euro and british pound sterling on our financial performance  iii our expectations that the clients with whom we do the largest amount of business will fluctuate from year to year  and our statements about the effects of large customer orders on our quarterly earnings  revenues  and total revenues  iv our statements regarding the impact on financial results in future periods if we determine that the financial condition of clients has deteriorated  v our statements regarding the impact on financial results in future periods if we misjudge the remaining economic life of a product  vi our statements concerning the impact of changes in our business judgment  market conditions  macro economic conditions  financial conditions of our clients  competition  business trends  and government activity on the application of our critical accounting estimates  vii our statements concerning the fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  whether as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results or other factors  viii our beliefs about our competitive strengths  ix our expectations regarding effective tax rates in future periods  x our expectations regarding a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits and the effect of the decrease on earnings  xi our expectations regarding the impact or lack of impact on our financial position and results of operations of the application of recent accounting standards  xii our expectations about the adequacy of our cash flows and our available lines of credit to meet our working capital needs  and our ability to raise additional funds if and when needed  xiii our expectations about our capital expenditures for future periods  xiv our expectations that our exposure to interest rate risk will not materially change in the future  xv our expectation that we will evaluate our need to invest in instruments to protect against interest rate fluctuations and our exposure to such interest rate risk  xvi our statements about the effects on our revenue recognition as a result of changes to a clients delivery requirements or a products completion  xvii our statements regarding our ability to increase sales of our higher margin products  xviii our expected costs associated with modifying our products to comply with applicable legal rules  regulations  and guidelines  including the credit card associations security and data protection rules 
there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
these may include changes in applicable laws and regulations  other activities of governments  governmental agencies  or other regulatory bodies that affect our products  services  or business operations  changes in accounting and auditing rules and changes in the interpretations of those rules  as well as those matters described in item a  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
see foreign sales and foreign market risks in part business  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  above for information regarding foreign currency exchange risks 
our committed lines of credit bear interest at a floating rate  which exposes us to interest rate risks 
we manage our exposure to this risk by minimizing  to the extent feasible  overall borrowing and monitoring available financing alternatives 
at june   we had total borrowings of approximately million and had not entered into any instruments to hedge the resulting exposure to interest rate risk 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future with increases in the outstanding amount under the line of credit 
as our total borrowing as of june  was approximately million  a change in interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
the market value of fixed interest rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
assuming that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as of june  remained constant throughout fiscal year  a change in interest rates would have affected our interest income for fiscal year by approximately million 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk associated with financial instruments  we place our temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions  generally with bond rating of a and above
